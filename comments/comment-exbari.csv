I go whole workdays without a care in the world because I’m busy and not eating. I only feel like I have to actually pay attention on weekends when the entire day is my own.,False,False

Like I don’t have eating disorder thoughts until I’m faced with food. It’s habit to survive off of monster and every zero calorie drink known to mankind. Eating disorders morph over time though so please try to recover because letting it boil inside only makes it more difficult to recover from.,False,False

I like to say I'm recovered but I still restrict and occasionally binge and even more occasionally purge. Ive never addressed it in therapy even though I'm almost 23 and have had this for as long as I can remember (at least like 8yrs old). I just don't fixate on it 24/7 anymore- it's almost just a lifestyle now,False,False

Can sit at work for hours and not think about food, instead I'm thinking hours on end how to best avoid other people.  That doesn't invalidate your ed though.",False,False
