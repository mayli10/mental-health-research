As someone else said, there's easier ways to get attention than by cutting. And to be honest I wonder if maybe you're gatekeeping a little bit? Like maybe two small cuts doesn't sound like a big problem, but it's still self harm. And i mean I think lots of us are guilty of looking for validation by telling someone close to us our unhealthy eating habits. I guess I'm saying that just like how your roommate doesn't know what you're going through, you don't know what they could be going through.  I'm sorry you've had such a hard time. If you feel like your roommate undermines or ignores your experiences, maybe try talking to them about it? It could just be that they truly don't realize.",False,False

She could be faking 100% of it, or she could be having the valid-est most mental-breakdowniest problems in the whole world. The problem here is that she is expecting and receiving attention for her needs without being able to recognise those same signs in other people.   You see everywhere on this forum how people with EDs can spot other people with EDs. If you're relapsing to the point where your bones are starting to protrude then it's frankly absurd she hasn't stopped for one second to consider ""Hey, maybe my roommate is also going through these problems.""  That doesn't invalidate your roommate's struggles. And indeed, being oblivious to the needs or problems of other people is actually usually comorbid with several other legitimate mental illnesses your roommate might have. Plus you may be very very good at hiding your symptoms, even if you don't know/think you are, as many people with EDs are. She still deserves help and attention for her problems, and she probably can't exactly *help* that she doesn't notice yours. But that doesn't make it any less shitty *for you*. Rather than wasting time worrying about whether your roommate is faking it or not, focus on the fact that no matter what she's experiencing, you are still entitled to the same level of care and concern that she's getting.  I think the only bad thing about this situation is that you're expected to be your roommate's keeper when it's sending you further into relapse and self harm. But you can't expect your roommate to be the one to notice - she's demonstrated that she doesn't have the inclination or, perhaps, capacity to register what you're going through, no matter how similar it is to what she's going through. I think it might be wise to see a school counselor and confide in them that being held responsible for your roommate's mental/physical wellbeing is triggering your own illness. You hopefully won't have to elaborate that much, but also don't let them walk over you. They need to have some other support measures in place for your roommate that don't rely on you, that's unfair and unsafe.",False,False

You provided me with a different perspective and I appreciate that. I know it's still an awful way to think, but I have always been there for her as I will continue to be, it's just that awful part of my brain where my ed resides that gives me my thoughts. But I really want to emphasize that these are just thoughts and I will always be there for her or anyone in need. I would never want anyone to feel the way that I do",False,True

However, I think it's different to tell people that you're mentally ill but refuse their help.

Don’t feel bad about thinking this way, I feel like the disorders you share with her are the ones putting in your head that she’s not on your level of cutting or eating because they’re waiting to jump on you and trick you into “showing” her what it’s really like. They’re just trying to prey on your thoughts and slowly make you do those things again. These disorders I feel never go away, but are always trying to somehow someway get you to go back to them, and you can get stronger, and they can get weaker but they’ll always be there.   That’s the sad part is no matter how weak and terrible life may be, the one person that I feel will always be there for you is your disordered self.  But back to the whole thing about her, everyone with these disordered habits shape them around themselves, and some people hide it some don’t. Maybe she is just really good at hiding it and you don’t know about the worst moments of what she’s done. Or maybe she only does have those 2 cuts on the wrist but the emotional pain inside her represents more cuts then a blade could make before being slimmed down to a thread of metal.  People like us I feel like truly are the greatest puppet masters of ourselves. No one knows whats going on in her head except her, she could be smiling laughing and while telling a joke, in her mind she’s crying into the cold bathroom tile floor.   Be there for her Somehow, it might make her feel better, and might make you feel better",False,False

Not everybody keeps their problems a secret, but that doesn't mean they're faking for attention. Personally I try to keep people from seeing the worst of my problems, but I know that talking about them is therapeutic, it reduces stress which makes managing illnesses easier, so I try to talk about my problems whenever they're relevant. Just because her cuts are on her wrist doesn't change the fact that she felt so terrible she went through with cutting as a coping mechanism. People don't really permanently scar their bodies for attention. There are way easier ways to get attention.",False,False
