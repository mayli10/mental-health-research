I had my LDR girlfriend stay at my place for almost three weeks. She left two days ago. I've been in relationships before, but never while being this deep into my ED.  Despite the fact that I love my girlfriend and everything (I'm also a girl btw, lol), it was VERY difficult. And I was so moody most of the time. She got to see me binge and then starve myself the next day. She got to see me cry out of fear of food, etc. I feel so ashamed in the end. But also happy that my emotional instability didn't ruin our time together. And I didn't feel like I was putting on a show by pretending to be ""normal"".  Do talk to your girlfriend about it. At least she can do is acknowledge your problem and try not to do/say things that are triggering. We're all struggling with things, she'll understand if she's a decent human being. If not, then you need to find yourself a better girlfriend.  Best of luck!",False,False
