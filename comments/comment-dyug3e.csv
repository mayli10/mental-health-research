Yes, an overly restrictive diet is a cause of hair loss but there are other reasons. Illnesses and stress can cause it for a fact.   Take a vitamin. Drink you water.  I would not expect your hair to fall out on 1200 if you legitimately have weight to lose. If you're talking about 2 pounds to lose you might have hair loss.",False,False
