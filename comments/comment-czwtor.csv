There's one account in particular that is just pissing me off so much right now, I dunno if I'm allowed to say who, but she just spouts the most IDIOTIC shite about health and not needing doctors or antibiotics and about how an elderly woman with (presumably type two) diabetes who has been told to avoid eating fruit by her doctors  ACTUALLY just needs to ""eat fruit all day and salad at night"" to recover ARGH NO JUST...fucking stop. If you're orthorexic or whatever JUST FUCKING ADMIT IT and carry on, just stop conning other people with this dangerous SHITE.

It was almost like a test to myself- I've been wanting to recover and working up the nerve to tell my fiance about my ED, so yesterday I even ate a sufficient breakfast and lunch, thinking ""well he wants to go out for a date night tonight. I'll probably go over my heavy restriction budget, but I'll be okay.""  And then he takes me to an Italian buffet, where I feel like I have to essentially binge to make the bill worth it and keep up with him, because he's looking at everything I put on my plate and he doesn't know I have anorexia _but does he?_  I hate restaurants where I have no idea how many calories I'm consuming. I guesstimate on the way home and at the end of the day I've eaten about 300 more than Fitbit says I burned.  I'm struggling so hard to tell myself that's okay and believe it. I'm trying not to punish myself today for it, but that's all my brain wants to do. I feel like it's pushed me farther away from telling my fiance I have an ED, further into the mindset of ""I want to tell him, but I just want to drop a few more pounds first...let me just hit this goal...""  I'm not ready to recover. I can't handle every day feeling as bad as going over made me feel, being watched as I eat, not getting the chance to burn off the calories I've eaten.
