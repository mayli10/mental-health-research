And like any other addiction she has to completely want recovery to recover. So for now being a support &amp; letting her open up to you at her own pace is perfect.   Maybe look into resources for people with careers. Don’t show her but just learn about it. If she ever brings up again that she wants treatment but can’t because of her job you’ll have more info. That would be the one time you’d have a chance that she is receptive.,False,False

Never comment on her food. Even if you think it's a compliment. If you're concerned, be as vague as possible about why. She already knows why, and the more specific you are about her habits/meals/behaviors, the more it could backfire.  I have a promise in my relationship that we settled on after a...bumpy start. She'll never try to control what I do, or invade my privacy, and I'll never lie to her or hide habits.  Both of us know, even though we've never said it: she'll break her end when she thinks that keeping it would endangered my life. I'll break my end when I think that keeping it will make her break her end.  It's an uneasy truce, and it has its limits. But as long as we don't reach those limits, it works alright. She gets the peace of mind of knowing - for real - how much she should be worrying. And I get to focus on living for our future, instead of being a contrary reactive bitch who sneaky-purges because ""you don't fuckin control me"".  Maybe some version of that could help you balance too.",False,False
