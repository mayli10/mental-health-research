I ate a few pieces of shrimp, bean dip and chips at my boyfriends family’s house. Told myself I wasn’t gonna eat at mine, got to mine, ate a decent sized amount and drank. And ate some cookies and a slice of pie. It’s so weird to think it’s not binging, because everyone else does it right?? I ended up getting wasted and purging every ounce up. So I guess it makes sense in my scenario why I didn’t gain anything. But still, I weighed myself and expected the worse LOL",False,False
