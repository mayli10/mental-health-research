I'm pretty sure it is a legitimate ""thin"" weight. Personally I was told a few times by family friends that I could even ""put on a little weight if I wanted""  Well I did. I'm 140 this morning and I don't want it! I kind of doubt anyone but myself can actually perceive the gain.  I lost from a hw of 208 and I get that same sort of uncanny ""is that really me"" feeling when I see myself in mirrors or photos. Its like my brain cannot accept how I look now.",False,False
