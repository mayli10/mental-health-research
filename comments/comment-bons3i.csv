At least that’d make it more human. Then it just angers me from a clear food waste point of view. Like when they throw out their grab bags from Al’s Pancake World. Not cool.,False,True

But like another commenter pointed out - they never EAT that much food.  They take a few bites, tops.    Also, fun fact: Alexis Bledel (Rory) hates coffee, so her coffee cups always had Coke in them!",False,False

They hardly touch all the food on screen! I mean I know it’s just a TV thing so they don’t have to worry about continuity while reshooting scenes, but shit. They order tons of food and most of it is still there when the episode moves on or the scene ends lol.   So they’re known for *ordering* a lot of food, not even eating it. Like you know those skinny friends who talk about how much they love food and eat all the time? But then when you go out with them they order one small thing and barely finish half and talk about how full they are and how much they just ate? Yeah.",False,False

She’s also portrayed as somewhat health conscious (like fighting the baby-sized soda cups lol) so I think we’re supposed to assume she actually has a normal diet with occasional waffles.,False,False

I didn’t even think that they’d have a subreddit but that makes sense.   That’s true! How are they able to afford all that junk, surely it ain’t cheap.",False,True

If I eat a waffle like that I’m bloated for the rest of the day and the next. It definitely doesn’t stop me from loving Parks and Rec and Leslie herself!
