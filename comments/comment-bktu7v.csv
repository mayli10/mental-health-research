They'll still be full from lunch so they'll just skip dinner and have a snack. Meanwhile, I had a bowl of fruit so of course I'm hungry again but it's not like I'm going to be the one who speaks up about wanting another meal. My brain is all like, ""if they don't need to eat, I shouldn't"".   For real though, it is getting easier. One day left. Maybe breaking my eating schedule is going to be good for me? I gotta learn how to stop thinking about food all the time.",False,True

My least favorite thing is how fucking late dinner can get pushed back. Everyone else is snacking all day so theyâ€™re not super hungry and all casual like you say. Meanwhile the increment btw lunch and dinner is already hard enough for me normally never mind waiting until 7-8 pm or later.,False,False

I recently went on a five day trip with friends and boy oh boy not being able to control what I was eating made me miserable. The only thing I could control was how much I ate, which is very difficult for me to do when I can't control what the food is. Plus I want exercising at all and had to drink a bunch when I don't really drink at all anymore. So not only did I gain weight, I had to binge when I got home because I was so frustrated at the whole situation.   Its crazy to think I used to not think twice about what and when I was eating. I at least have a rough idea of what I'm eating at least a day in advance. Its really hard to imagine ever going back.",False,False

My best friend is the same way, whenever we hang out for more than a day or go on an overnight trip together he is soooo relaxed about food and flexible with times or what he's eating. I get very frustrated and jealous at the same time. Maybe say something about your blood sugar and that you need to eat within a certain time window or you'll get sick?",False,False
