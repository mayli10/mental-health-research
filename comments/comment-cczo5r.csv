Fucking tearing up my kitchen eating whatever I could get my hands on. Ate over 3,000 calories and can't purge it because people in the house will hear me, and I can't go for a walk to exercise it off because it's 9pm and getting dark soon... So it's staying in to all get fucking digested into my fatass body. Bring on the 36 hour fast, all I'm consuming is water and tea.",False,False

My youngest just turned 3 and I literally JUST figured out about the diastasis a few months ago. Seriously thought I was just a fat pos no matter how much I restricted because of that shit. **Huge shout out to all 4 obs I had that NEVER MENTIONED it to me, even though I had (still have) a 2 finger freaking gap ðŸ™„ðŸ™„.**  Literally had no idea it was even a thing.",False,False

I think heâ€™s pissed at me because my phone was on silent a few days ago so I didnâ€™t see his messages that he was somewhere half an hour away from my house and wanted to come over.   First of all, even though I was off that day, as far as he knew I was working, and he knows I donâ€™t get home from work until about two hours after he sent me those messages. Second, I need a hell of a lot more than 30 minutes notice if you want to come over. And finally, I donâ€™t exist solely to be at your beck and call whenever you want your dick sucked. Because thatâ€™s literally all that happens. He comes over, I give him what he wants, and then he fucks off telling me itâ€™ll be my turn next time. Liar. (Donâ€™t get me wrong, I quite like doing it [sick, sick, itâ€™s because it gives me the same good feelings as purging does without the actual vomiting part] but itâ€™s just a matter of principle at this point.)   On an unrelated note, thanks to a nice little cocktail of vodka and pills, I texted my former therapist late last night and told her all about how Iâ€™m relapsing. So now today I get to deal with the fallout from that, trying to do damage control and stop her from worrying.  Canâ€™t decide if intoxicated texting is better or worse than the intoxicated shopping Iâ€™ve been doing, as Iâ€™m rapidly running out of money.  Good times.",False,False

I'm optimistic now that I can fix this and my motivation has just shot up.  If you've ever had a baby or are dealing with really, really stubborn belly fat and the exercises you've been doing only seem to make it worse, look it up.
