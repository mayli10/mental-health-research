Like my nightmare would be a date because they always involve going to dinner or whatever and eating has always been a very private thing to me. Like, why? Why sit across from someone you’re attracted to and chew food and look at food and idk as weird as it sounds it’s like a sacred act to me HAHAHAHAHAH  Even going out to eat with a friend or family member is awkward cause like I said. Private act. ",False,False

It's especially hard when everyone else is going about their dinner and pressuring you to eat faster, asking *did you like the bread and butter?* or *here, try this steak!* (despite the fact that I'm vegetarian) and it's so incredibly nerve wracking. This is why I hardly ever go out to eat and, if I do, I only order soup. Guys, soup can genuinely make eating out much more comfortable than it would be under ordinary circumstances solely because of the fact that you can just *sip* something and not have to focus as hard on people breathing down your back, watching your mouth while you chew, thinking that you're fat because you ordered that big pasta even though no one is probably thinking that at all. It's the little things sometimes.  If this isn't an incentive to move to Japan for the sole reason of a private restaurant environment then am I even impulsive, though? Because I'm contemplating it, no joke.",False,False

I literally get anxious and uncomfortable watching other people get huge, calorie dense appetizers, deserts, etc. It’s the worst and makes you feel like a horrible person oml",False,False

I just hate sitting there in a chair or booth feeling like everyone sees me and even worse, I see all of them as well (through my own messed up lenses)   Meaning even if I don’t mean to be; I automatically judge what everyone is eating based off their appearance / body language / etc. Eating out has always been pretty awkward to me, tbh. It’s not really a comfy or fun thing. ",False,False
