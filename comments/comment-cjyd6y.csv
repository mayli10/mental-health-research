Like especially putting that crap on the internet for people to see is wrong to me",False,False

It's also kind of fucked up how this whole fitness facade is so disordered. I thought for once people would be motivated to be healthier but it seems us human beings can't stop coming up with better ways to fuck ourselves up...,False,False

It‚Äôs still problematic, but maybe some of these people with big platforms are starting to see how harmful it can be? We‚Äôll see!",False,False

A lot of the fitness people trying out all sorts of diet and workout routines are just people who like that stuff. Yes, they could get obsessive and have some ED thoughts, but it's subclinical at best.  I've been trying to accept that I'm not like other people on these fad diets because I have a legitimate ED. However, treatment hasn't worked for me either. So I idk what to do",False,False

Companies spend millions of dollars trying to convince the public that their food is a Delicious Treat, for Spoiling Yourself With, even when it's just corn syrup in different shapes. They stuff it full of sodium, so you mistake thirst for hunger. They design the freaking shape of their chips and salt, for maximum profit, maximum addictiveness. Entire industries run on encouraging us to binge-eat synthetic cocaine!food that makes us feel like shit and tastes like sludge ass after two bites.  And then these dudes are like...yes, and also, we're going to make it rare like a diamond. Special junk food. On a regular basis. Here it is, my junk food day of happiness. Anticipationnnn.  I've never had anybody *tell* me they were going to use my comment as a copypasta, but I think I'm a little too blazed to be trusted with the English language right now. Or the ability to have opinions about potato chips.  Tl;Dr yeah idk that cheat meal dealio doesn't seem like an idea to be cherished, really",False,False
