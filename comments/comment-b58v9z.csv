If it doesn't, it is a waste of time.  You only want to chill one area a session. Pick a spot and stick with it. I typically keep my chiller on the same spot for 2 hours to chill that spot as cold as the chiller will get it. The next day I move to a new spot. I set a course to cover a large area of my body, like I'm painting it with a brush, with each new spot overlapping the last by 1/2"". When i finish covering the entire area, I go back to the first area and go again. You can do more than 1 chilling in a day.   I believe cryolipolosys is an evolutionary reaction to sleeping on frozen ground. The body reacts by killing off up to 20% of the fat in an area, up to the depth it chills. So I have a pot belly, only 1/2"" of depth is probably getting cold enough. By the time I get back to the same spot, the the 1/2"" might be 1/10th of an inch thinner, but there can still be the 2.5"" inched not yet effected. The next time I chill the remainder of the 1/2"", along with another 1/10th"" and again it get that bit thinner.   I have hit my belly over 30 times over 60 days of 2-3 hours a time and have taken a big handful of fat and shrunk it down to pinching an inch.  [this is a recent pic on the left and an old one on the right](https://i.imgur.com/nru4DwS.png) look how much higher my belly button is! I'm also doing the right side of my body, so my right side love handle is significantly less than the left.",False,False

I'm having fantastic results! I think cryolipolysis is the future of fat loss. I'm down 25 pounds of fat and my pants are not only fitting right, they loose.    I'm curious what product you used and how you know it isn't working. It takes up to 3 months to see full results from each session and even under the best technology, only 20% of the fat in an area chilled to below 5c will be removed. Actually chilling depth might only be 1/4"" of 2"" inches of fat, so like a potato peeler, session after session removes layer after layer.   If you want to know if the device you have will actually work, buy a [thermometer like this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Aquarium-Digital-LCD-Temperature-Thermometer-Probe-Fish-Tank-Refrigerator/401699433325?hash=item5d8726eb6d%3Ag%3A7D8AAOSwutJbo3aW&amp;LH_BIN=1) and place it between the chiller and your body. If the temp never gets below 40f/5c degrees, it is useless. If in an hour it gets down below 35f/2c, the chiller is good. Below 32f/0c and you risk freezer burn.  I've also used aluminum and copper bottles with ice/water and salt to do spot reduction, like I'm working to reduce my neck. My wife is working on an hourglass figure by removing the middle fat roll (yes it's working).   ",False,False
