It‚Äôs totally normal and fine that that comment made you uncomfortable. I‚Äôm sure your partner wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt you- honestly it sounds like he was trying to compliment you. However even if his intent was fine it still should be something you talk about it.   If you don‚Äôt there is an absolute chance he might say something similar again that could upset you even worse or start to brew some negative thought patterns in you. And if it‚Äôs getting a reaction out of you, it can be very frustrating as a partner to see your partner upset and not understand why. That can lead to a whole host of problems.   A simple. ‚Äú hey earlier you said [blank] and I know you weren‚Äôt trying to be hurtful but it really made me feel uncomfortable and I didn‚Äôt feel like I could say anything at the time. ‚Äú and go from there",False,False

It doesn't have to be confrontational, but you can still talk to him about how that comment was upsetting.",False,False
