You were being egotistical and now you're playing innocent lol  Where can you go to donate little bits of a single-ready-made-cupcake? Or a single plate of chips and a sloppy single slice of cake? It's rude at some point, and incredibly inconveniencing for people who already CAN'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER, unless there are homeless people already chillin on the side but with my experience of being harassed and stalked, talking to strange men doesn't appeal to me, and I rather help people in more useful ways or in bulk.

It strengthens my resolve with every no and eventually they catch on. I never give in, I don't care if the donuts are celebrating a kids cancer going into remission, never gonna happen. One place had a huge culture of food/treats so I ended up bringing in cut veggies every Friday to leave on my desk. It was also a great conversation ender. No, I don't want your homemade cookies, do you want some fucking celery, Barb!?  Family on the other hand can be harder to deal with, but I still say no consistently. My aunt will not stop offering me food even if I literally just ate (I'm a binge ester and very overweight, and I do eat at her house when I'm hungry) so the one time I counted and told her she offered me food 7 times in the last 15 minutes even though I told her I just ate.
