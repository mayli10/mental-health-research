It’s hard to say what you should do. If you miss him and think you made a mistake just wait a while and let yourself feel before you make any other decisions. Breaking up with someone feels a lot like falling, and sometimes the stark contrast between that and having a ground beneath our feet can make us want to go back to someone, just to feel safe again, but make sure if you do that it’s because of him and not because you don’t want to be alone. I hope things start making sense for you again because I know how confusing and scary it feels to be single after a longterm relationship. Wishing you the best of luck.",False,False

Restriction always makes me second-guess myself and confuse my emotions, especially regarding self-esteem and self-worth. It makes sense that you feel lonely and depressed cuz of the circumstance, and restriction is likely heightening that. It's ok that u broke up with him because your priorities are THE priority, in my opinion. U can't sacrifice ur life for someone else, regardless of how great a guy they are. Try to boost yourself up/remind yourself why you are cool and important and need to listen to ur needs before talking &lt;3",False,False

I don’t know if I can help but I would say if you are heavily restricting. It may be amplifying and magnifying your emotions. Adding to the existing fears around the changes in your life. Current and future.   If you need to chat by all means post away. I will do my best to reply as honestly as I can.,False,False
