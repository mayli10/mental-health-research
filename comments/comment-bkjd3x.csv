With me it feels like whilst there are good things about my life, there are also overwhelming sucky things too. Like, i have friends, but half of them don’t give a shit about me and are going to drop me after graduation. I often feel horribly lonely even when in a room of the people who should be my closest friends. I’m going to graduate, but I’m terrified of not being able to make it in ‘the real world’. I want to do a masters in a year or so, but I’m scared it’ll be pointless. I really want to excel in my career but I have no contacts. I’m thin-ish and okay looking but I’m the ugliest girl in my friendship group. The only truly good thing are the handful of friends I can actually rely on and my boyfriend. Idk. Sometimes it all seems a bit pointless.",False,False

I have a job that I love that I’m actually really good at, I’m 2 years sober, i have friends, I’m getting attention from band dudes that I like, I’m learning a lot in school, and I’m going to more shows. Idk maybe it’s cuz I only just relapsed on my ED but I’m pretty happy.",False,False

My mom tries her best to give me everything I need. I have a car, and I'm going to a really prestigious school where I get a great education. Legit the only thing wrong in my life is that all the men in my life are trash, but other than that, I have everything I want and sometimes I just feel like a rich spoiled white girl ( I'm not even white or rich) ahi doesn't know how privileged they are. And I feel like I cant have a mental illness because everything in my life is so good.",False,False

I have everything others would want in their life. Money, secure career, fulfilling career. Great family. It's not enough for me. My ED consumes my life. I'm so ravaged by my ED that my 'perfect' life doesn't matter to me. I feel like such a mess. I completely feel you on the 'what could possibly fix my food issues?'.",False,False

The idea that I might have anything to love of my own that I’ve created even if it’s weighed out by my bullshit is more comfort than any “shoot for the stars” nonsense I’ve been hearing as of late. Sounds like you’re making strides, who knows where you’ll end up? If anything it’s really nice for some people like me to hear right now.",False,False

I have loving parents who are still together and who taught me how to cook and modeled healthy eating habits (minus my mom's self esteem and weight issues but she never directly commented on my body or encouraged me to diet with her or anything). I have pretty good physical health, got through high school and my bachelor's without too much struggle, summa cum lauda and all that. I now have a job that I like pretty well, and my job is paying my grad school tuition so I can take night classes basically for free and get a master's soon.  When I read posts on here about people who are emotionally abused at home, in danger of becoming homeless, who don't have money for groceries or who put themselves in financial trouble through bingeing... I don't know, it makes me feel stupid. Like, life has been pretty kind to me and I've still managed to screw it up, imagine what I'd be like if I had to face any real hardship.  But I guess sometimes we have to remember that mental illness doesn't need a reason.",False,False

I've had depression since I was like 8 so every day is a fight. However I have been pretending for such a long time, I manage to feel OK some days.  I have a job, I love my co-workers, I have stuff I really like to do, I have travel plans and such. I thought I would be dead at 21 too. I was very confused when I actually reached 22...  But it seems that this stupid bulimia and disordered eating doesn't want to let me be happy either. I thought I had strong will but I can't fucking stop myself from binging and feeling anxious about food ALL THE TIME. I don't know how to get rid of it. I wish it would just get bored of me.",False,False

On the surface, my life is great. Instagram picture-perfect. But inside my body, my brain is a hellfire depression swamp of extreme self-hatred and constant anxiety, with a hefty portion of that devoted to my body and my food intake.   The only way I reconcile it is this: the laws of thermodynamics apply to everyone. Everyone has to deal with this struggle, whether they consciously acknowledge it or not. I just happen to suffer under the weight of my own crushing self-hatred and self-doubt, whereas other people somehow don’t, or at least to a lesser degree. Everyone has the things that haunt them. Mine are just particularly sharp and ever-present.",False,False
