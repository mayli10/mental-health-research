People you haven’t talked to in awhile but who think of you without you knowing. I’m just a stranger on the internet but I care.   I care because I spent years in that same dark place and my heart goes out to anyone walking that path. I begged the universe to let me die. I spent hours daily planning how to die. It even became a coping mechanism in a way - planning for the pain to end soon. I believed that when I 100% committed to die, I would do just that. Instead I ended up with tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and a narrow miss with anoxic brain damage. The universe is funny like that I guess. Things are getting better for me these days, though in the dark times I absolutely could not have conceived of that happening.   I’m so sorry you’re hurting. I’m sorry things feel so desperately lonely. I’m sorry it feels like there’s no way forward except leaving. I hope you stay. I hope you find help that helps. I hope you find a way to life after life. Just an internet stranger sending zen hugs. I know it’s so small it hardly matters. But even the tiniest spark can be a light in the darkness.",False,False

You deserve to live and enjoy life. Just try and write down whatever makes you feel warm inside like puppies, blue skies, a child’s laughter etc. You’ll feel better. Trust me",False,False
