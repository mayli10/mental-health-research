I have an incredibly thin sweet friend of mine, who I've used to validate my over consumption of caffeine.  She actually (unknowingly) helped me break out of only having black coffee, because she joyfully drinks coffee whenever and however she likes. I've actually discovered a taste for a particular flavored coffee and will replace/delay meals with it. I've also just been trying to eat what I want when I'm physically hungry as I see a lot of non-disordered thin people do, and it's been helping a lot.   They don't put themselves on schedules, and have no problem only eating/snacking as much as they want (which isn't always much, go figure) when they're hungry or there is something worth having. It's taken a load off my mind already.",False,False

I have a friend who is very unhealthy with his eating. He drinks 4+ cups of coffee a day and barely eats or sleeps. I LOVE spending time with him and DAMN he is hot as heck. And since we’ve been spending a lot of time together, I have been eating less and less and now I’ve realized I have the same eating and sleeping habits as him. Oops.",False,False

But we had dinner as a family almost every night, and it really messed up my counting because I didn't know all the ingredients she used and I couldn't exactly break out the measuring cups in front of everyone as I took my portion. So I used to try to eat exactly what my mom ate, or maybe a little less. If she ate dessert, I felt like I was allowed to too. That kind of thing.",False,False
