It's waving red flags like the damn ""Les Miz"" barricade scene.  All levity aside, it's fucking terrifying and so sad to have your body broken down, atrophying at the age of 29 from a chronic eating disorder. For example, it's been four years since I've had a period and that lack of estrogen yielded osteoporosis. So about a month ago tripping on an uneven sidewalk cracked one of my ribs, and there is a literal handful of broken teeth on my bedside table.  This is just one of the horrific physical ramifications of my eating disorder; there's quite the catalogue. BUT, as others have suggested and you know, it's not one singular cutoff BMI where everything goes haywire.  It's LONGEVITY--my disorder's been chronic, fluctuating in intensity for a decade, and that's a LOT of wear and tear--and BEHAVIORAL.  Pertaining to the latter, two of my acutely near-death experiences in the ER were at BMIs 17 and 18.9. Once I binge/purged my potassium down a level where the literature says ""life is untenable""; the second time I waterloaded after an all-night binge/purge episode and my sodium tanked. Both were nightmares.  Please, whatever BMI you're at, know how dangerous this disease is and that you don't deserve to suffer to dodge these bullets, nor the everyday suffering. Please fight. Hug.

I think the GP gathered that things are a bit stressful in terms of family life etc. And I think he's thinks that I risk being depressed or something. But I just didn't know how to bring the eating side into it. He just was staring/listening to me so intently that I felt a bit awkward. But he said if I feel my mental health is suffering to come back to him. So idk if I will or not.
