Veganism is fine, _maybe_ (I'm vegetarian with a dairy allergy), but since she's still pretty young I wouldn't recommend cutting meat and dairy out of her diet unless she's willing to dutifully buy and take a multivitamin, and eat a lot of healthy foods (beans, nuts, soy products, dark leafy greens) to replace the nutrients she'll be missing.  IF fasting is a hard no from me. That subreddit alone is toxic and it's a _very_ steep and addictive slope from shorter intermittent fasts to just not eating for days. Take it from someone who knows üôÉ",False,False

It breaks my heart as well, I don't want her to end up like me. I would not encourage any form of dieting, as dieting can be a gateway to an ED. Personally, I try to model good behavior for her when I am around her and be open with her about my struggles. She knows I've been in treatment and everything. I also try to reinforce body acceptance and an ""all foods fit"" mentality around her and on my social media for her to see. I don't talk about weight loss, food, calories, ""healthy"" vs ""bad"" foods when at home with her. And most importantly, I try to reinforce to her all of her amazing qualities that she has *besides* her physical looks. That she doesn't need to be ""perfect"" on the outside and that she is already an incredible human.   I hope things get better for you and your sister :)",False,False

Maybe suggest something such as intermittent fasting or veganism? that‚Äôs probably not the most ~healthy~ advice but that‚Äôs what I did when my best friend started exhibiting ED behaviours and I was luckily able to deter her before she got too far into the rabbit hole",False,False
