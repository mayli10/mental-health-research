My doc used to test me every 6 months during my veganism/recovery attempts to make sure I was getting what I needed consistently. I really think it helped keep things sorta on track (as much as I did forget to take my supplements lol) which is why I'd recommend bringing it up again ðŸ˜Š,False,False

I'd test that along with thyroid activity via a blood exam when I went in. You can say its ""to make sure everything is in check during recovery"" to your doc. They should test your thyroid with a blood exam before diagnosing you with something anyhow. ",False,False
