I don’t think it made my face thinner at all but it did improve my voice range I went down a half step and up a whole step in my chest voice so that was awesome. The recover sucked but was worth it. I had tonsillitis non stop for a year and I had giant tonsils with tonsil stones all the time. So glad I don’t have to deal with them anymore.,False,False

The one good doctor I had rapport with at uni was like, ""that might be the most eating disordered request I've ever had,"" and we laughed about it. She was cool but most doctors would never allow an elective surgery like that.",False,False
