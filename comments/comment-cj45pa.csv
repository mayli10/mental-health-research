The portion is basically a snack size (4-5 gummies) and 40 or 50kcal iirc. The reason I liked them was that I could take them without food and not feel sick. The other plus was they had Omega-3 and the sources of the vitamins were transparent. They have gendered varieties like many and I think the women's ones had iron in them.  They're too expensive for me now, though. I just have these Costco vitamins to get through.  I can't think of any to stay away from. Curious what others think!",False,False
