Also, it’s kind of a slippery slope. In my experience, I go in thinking that I’ll finally be beautiful and perfect, but then I scrutinize everything and become depressed that my results didn’t turn out exactly how I wanted them. Which leads me to getting revision surgeries which are almost double the price. Then I scrutinize again and the cycle continues. However, I am more confident now than I was before. As long as you don’t think of plastic surgery as some kind of magical end all, I think it can be helpful.",False,False

At some degree, my gender dysphoria plays in, so I can't really decipher if it's purely ED thoughts. But my stretch marks on my stomach from years of binging? If I had a good career I would do it in a heartbeat. Maybe some FFS as well, but that's a heck of a lot more expensive.",False,False

It would be nice to be more confident in my self and be conventionally pretty but spending thousands on procedures (that could possibly go wrong) as a college student seems dumb.,False,True

The thought of living with it forever keeps me up at night, causes panic attacks and makes me legitimately uninterested in continuing to live. I don't want to be dramatic, but I seriously took my old body for granted and would kill to have it back.   Main obstacle is the price though. I could never in a million years afford it, so relief feels like it's so many miles away that I'll never look or feel normal again. It sucks.",False,False
