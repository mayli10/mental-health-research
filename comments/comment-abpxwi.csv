We are going to Tokyo Disney and some other tourist spots so there will definitely be more fat Americans around I bet.,False,True

I really needed it!   I’m not really worried about rudeness from Japanese people as I have read that they are some of the most courteous people in the world. I’m just scared of drawing negative attention. Your experience makes me feel more relieved about that though. And you reminded me of why I’m going in the first place: to enjoy the culture and see the sights. ,False,True

I ended up walking about 10 miles per day while I was there. I did feel a little large compared to the Japanese women but compared to the other tourists I saw I felt small lol ,False,False

It's like thinking ""Wow, everyone here's a little shorter than I am"", you don't really dwell on it. I had the honor of being Asian AND a medically overweight tourist (twice as embarrassing lol) while visiting Japan this summer and never got any semblance of rudeness that could have stemmed from it.   Honestly, you should enjoy the food! You have an absolutely healthy BMI and how often do you get to enjoy authentic cuisine and culture in Japan? Plus, you'll want to enjoy the romance with your SO to its fullest! If you feel more comfortable when watching your intake, keeping busy by seeing as many sights as possible tends to distract me from eating as much, but YMMV and I stand by my prior recommendation.  Good luck, have fun, and (hopefully) congratulations!!!",False,False

I basically ate breakfast with the family then spent all day and night doing my own thing. If we caught up at lunch or dinner I would just say that I ate already. I'm not sure about you, but as a family we don't usually eat set meals on vacation.  On the downside, I was bloated almost all the time I was there. Luckily I don't wear bikinis or basically show any skin. So I just sat on the beach with jeans and and t-shirt. When I swam I wore shorts and rash shirt.  Be cause I was quite active I actually lost weight. Which I was surprised about. I would suggest to eat to maintenance (or more), but just be generally more active. It's not hard when sightseeing. Try to choose challenging places (as challenging as you can). I take it that you are going somewhere in Asia? Every Asian country I've been to has had some beautiful walking tracks/parks and their food is typically better than western countries (lighter, filling, tastier and not fried in a gallon of oil).  Good luck and have fun!",False,False
