I used to be nearly nocturnal but my sleep schedule has totally flipped for the same reasons you described, so my roommate has definitely noticed.

My excuse is to wake up at 4:30am for my job. Of course I'm also verbally attacked about why I continue this schedule on the weekend. My logic is, I still have to wake up at 4:30am on Friday, so naturally, I'm tired by 8:30pm. So I sleep when I'm tired. Mind blowing, right? You've heard of the myth called intuitive eating. I do intuitive sleeping. This 8:30pm - 4:30am schedule continues through the weekend and Monday is just another day. There's no struggle because I only got 4 hours of sleep.  Also, google the health benefits of keeping a consistent sleep schedule. It helps with literally everything. Stronger immune system, healthy hair/skin/nails, better muscle growth, better bone strength, improved mood. Why people choose to throw their sleep schedule off on a weekly basis blows my mind.",False,False
