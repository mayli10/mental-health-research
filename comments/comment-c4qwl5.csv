I live in a big city and I usually commute by public transit because I don't have a car. Happens to the best of us. There's nothing unorthodox about it but I get why it makes you feel a certain type of way because it makes me feel the a certain type of way even on good days, too. What I like to do is place my purse on my lap if I'm sitting. You can do that with your school bag and you won't really be able to tell that way. No one else will either- though I doubt anyone has to begin with.",False,False
