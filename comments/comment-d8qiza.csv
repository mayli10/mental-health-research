I wasn't trying to come off like ""just recover!"", I was just trying to provide encouragement for you to try upping your intake.

Please please protect yourself, your body and your child and up your intake!! I've also read a lot of posts about students having their academic success take HUGE hits negatively as a result of their EDs. You will not be able to do work/school/parenting on that few calories, and you could get really hurt or hurt your child in the process.  Be the role model you want your child to have!",False,False
