The latkes and challah guilt are so real too. For some reason I’ve managed to make any religiously associated foods “safe”-r in my brain.  Do you have a Trader Joe’s near you?  Here are some of my fav jewfoods from TJs that make me feel safe and happy:  Shakshuka - 160 calories Latkes - 2 for 150 calories Challah - 1500 for a whole loaf (the most delicious binge i’ve ever had) Toooons of lox options  They’re really good about labeling things kosher/pareve if you’re considering going full kosher too!!  I hope you’re able to enjoy your treats and chag purim sameach! ✡️  There really is a plethora of traditionally Jewish food that are amazing. I haven’t had a latke in so long. Honestly I used to think of them as safe foods, I think it’s because it’s a traditional/religion/cultural thing within the Jewish community, the “home cooked meal (but jewish”,  and having eating it  for many many years. And it’s another point about how much Judaism really centers everything around food.   I am unfortunately celiac so I can’t get many things, but there are a couple places that do GF versions, or in the past I’ve just made my own   I definitely have been thinking about going kosher, and I want to do it for all the right reasons , but I’m worried that I’ll end up using it as a reason to not eat.   Thank you for your response! And chag purim sameach to you as well 😊",False,True

I also definitely understand dealing with it in the current sociopolitical time, when you do think about it it’s almost like it’s more at stake, but it’s a really hard place to be and especially to also deal with other things weighing you down right now. The energy to feel it just isn’t there. But as we do with our families, we shut up and smile and eat and make nice conversation with them in a way that becomes ritualistic, EVERYTHING happens around food, even within the religion. There’s a certain way you’re expected to present yourself and there’s cultural shame that comes with not doing that",False,True

At least we have Yom Kippur...until the sunset lmao.  I don’t know. My Jewishness is really important to me too—and especially with the whole sociopolitical climate right now (in so many ways), I do also hesitate to give this topic too much thought because it’s painful for certain.  But I feel like there’s *such* a weird culture among (Ashkenazi) Jewish folks (in the US at least) of like...food being this massive indicator of love, celebration and togetherness even outside the context of actual religious holidays (wherein the emphasis on food is totally a universal Jewish thing, lol), but it so often comes coupled with this super intense focus on generally keeping up appearances!! Which is...uh, kind of a bad mixture?? Or at least a very difficult one.  Like you know that stereotype of The Jewish Grandmother/Mother who’s always trying to feed everyone? That was legitimately my grandma, haha, but she would also be the first one to rudely comment on me losing or gaining weight.",False,False

I also am DEFINITELY going to call it humantushin from now on.   There’s just so much of the culture and the holidays that are based around fasting and/or eating large amounts of food, it’s difficult and triggering, but it’s nice to know I’m not the only one freaking out in my head at the dinner table",False,True

They say it’s bread, but it’s really just cake masquerading as bread. It’s a delicious, delicious lie.  I know saying this may be useless, but enjoy happy Purim treats if you can. If it makes you laugh, once when I was younger a girl in my class got in trouble for calling them humantushin. I don’t know why but it still makes me chuckle when I think about it. ",False,False
