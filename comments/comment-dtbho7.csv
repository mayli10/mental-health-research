Then I proceeded to drink a large bottle of wine. I got half way through it in 20 mins, then promptly fell over several times in front of friends and family three separate times!   Secretly I was hoping that I would throw up because of the wine. NOPE not so lucky; instead I put myself to bed at 7:30 P.M&gt; after falling over a lit grill, acting like an idiot laughing at myself and talking gibberish like a homeless man.- Superior! Your not alone in the destructive behaviors. My only Solis is I feel that because I am recognizing my fucked-up-ness. I am o.k....... OH the LIES we tell ourselves!",False,False
