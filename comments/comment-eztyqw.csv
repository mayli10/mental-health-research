I'd fast for days and then binge, then go do it all over again.  I was less inclined to binge when I stopped fasting and ate 'enough' each day. I'm not sure what will be a right amount for you without triggering a binge, so I'd suggest to increase your intake a little, and spread it out.   I will say, even when I was out of the binge cycle, I'd find myself doing it out of habit. I wouldn't crave or want the food, I was just used to binging after days of restriction. So keep an eye out for that habitual shit",False,False
