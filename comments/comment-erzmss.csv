In fact, my psychiatrist specifically prescribed it to me because I was so worried about possible weight gain that I would refuse to take Mirtazapine etc. (my sister gained 30 lbs on Mirtazapine).When I first started taking it, it actually decreased my appetite.However, it made me a little too nervous and easily agitated, so my psychiatrist decided to put me on Wellbutrin in conjunction with an SSRI. I think the SSRI kind of balances out the decreased appetite-aspect.  The increased risk of seizures is very serious though and ED-patients are especially at risk because a lot of them have electrolyte imbalances. Before my psychiatrist agreed to prescribe it to me, he weaned me off all laxatives and I had to promise him to let him know immediately if I relapsed into laxative addiction or purging.  So if you purge a lot or have a problem with laxatives, please be super careful with Wellbutrin and make sure to discuss this issue with your doctor!",False,False

I found Wellbutrin to be seriously helpful for my depression. The problem is I had a very weird side effect from it which made me wanna go off of it. I have had clear skin my entire life I was never a person who had trouble with acne but awhile after I started Wellbutrin, I had severe breakouts mostly on the face sometimes it would happen to me on my arms and back. My sister unfortunately also had this happen to her on Wellbutrin. I'm not sure how common this is for people who take it. Something to note is that I am extremely sensitive to medications and tend to easily get a lot of side effects. The acne of course made me depressed and the medication no longer helped. I hope you and anyone else on this medication have a better experience!",False,False
