While I have not personally seen mentions of eating disorders on that sub, to me it just screams ‚ÄúED friendly‚Äù if that makes sense",False,False

I agree with you about how often it would just be used as an excuse to hate women, I couldn't express myself last night. The accounts I saw though were more trying to highlight specific models and bloggers who weren't being honest about their calorie intake and as such misleading impressionable and vulnerable people.   Like, I understand what you mean about ""shaming"" people for ""eating a cookie"", but I also think it's dangerous to pretend that you can eat thousands of calories a day easily and maintain an underweight BMI WITHOUT showing the whole reality (exercise purging, low restriction/fasting on other days, not actually eating all of the food they're implied to have eaten, etc.) for exactly the same reason I think photoshop can be dangerous - people don't realise it's inaccurate, so compare it to themselves and think that there's something wrong with them for not being able to lose weight/be that skinny without restricting.  It happens with ""normal"" food, too, not just ""junk"". A lot of Instagrammers with eating disorders sell nutritionally balanced food plans that they don't actually follow. Even if the food plans they're selling are healthy, they're misleading their audience to think that they achieved their body by eating like that when they didn't. Again, that invites comparison, especially from very young, inexperienced followers, and believing that something is wrong with their body and how they gain weight can lead to restriction and other disordered eating in compensation. (I mean, that's just the tip of the iceberg that is non-nutritionists selling diet plans to strangers, but that's a separate issue.)   I see so many posts and topics here from people panicking about how other people seem to be able to ""eat whatever they want"" and either maintain or lose, but they can't so something must be wrong with them, but they aren't seeing how much food they actually do/don't eat and how much exercise they do. The accounts I saw, even though they were often bad in other ways, at the very least did highlight the issue of misrepresenting calorie intake.  Again, I didn't know there was a hashtag or anything like that and I'm sure the tag is awful bc people ruin everything and love to hate on women for no reason. So I'm sure there are lots of similar accounts out there that just post a skinny person holding a bagel and screech YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE EATEN THAT!!!   But I also think there's a reason to point out that there is a trend of underweight models who give the impression they are eating more than they really are, yet still maintaining an underweight BMI, and that this has a negative impact on their younger, vulnerable followers.  Sorry this is so long. I'm having a hard time formulating my words and I believe/agree with you. I just don't think the concept or what OP is asking for are inherently bad things.",False,False

Sure, it sometimes exposed underweight models not eating food, but more often it was just used to attack thinner girls for daring to eat a cookie, because there‚Äôs no way for them to be skinny and have junk food. It reeked of jealousy more than anything else.  Besides, we here say we ate stuff when we didn‚Äôt. Why should we be shamed for that?
