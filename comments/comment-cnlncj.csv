She’s also eating nutritious whole foods, she’s not eating 5000cal worth of potato chips every day. Like I said, she is not planning on eating this much in the long term— she’s just trying to get her body to a place where she’s not hungry 24/7. I think it’s similar to the extreme hunger a lot of people experience in recovery",False,False

Hopefully she at least halves that in the future. It could make her sick. Perhaps she should eat lower calorie foods so she can feel full without overeating.,False,False

She was extremely lean but suffered from extreme hunger and cravings due to her restriction. She recently decided to start eating to satiety (which for her sometimes goes up to 5000cal daily), and is essentially going through ED recovery and practicing more intuitive eating habits. She expects that as her body recovers from her restriction, her appetite and weight will return to normal. These redditors are basically saying that her recovery is bullshit",False,False

She is eating primarily whole foods and is working with at least 2 coaches who have found that this is the right way to go. It's not binge eating if you make the concious decision, are still hungry, and especially if you are able to stop once you're full! Calorie wise it's a binge, but extreme hunger is well documented and the way to fix it is (usually) eating until satiated",False,False
