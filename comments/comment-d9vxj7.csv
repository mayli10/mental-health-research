We restrict and feed the guilt. We eat eat eat and grow the distress. Looking around, everyone else seems so relaxed with food. Yet we feel only shame &amp; anxiety.    Feel no shame. This is your life. Lived without condition and judgement. Today be kind to yourself. Know you’re not alone. Reject the ideas of shame, regret, contempt and stigma. If you want we can dig this up. We can talk and share. You have lived your past. You live in your present. Your future can be lived anyway you want.   I know it’s easy to type this, I know these are only words but I have lived this.   I heavily restrict during the weekdays and drink heavily on the weekends. I am recovering, I am better then I was. I am not whole yet. Some days are better than others.  Maybe I might find peace or the answers I am looking for but today I am living, failing and picking myself up to try again. Fail again, pick myself up and try again.    If you want post me a reply or if you want direct message me, please do. I will do my best to help.   Hope my sharing helped.",False,False
