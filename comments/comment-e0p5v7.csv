But I do have a need for my boyfriend to be attracted to me. That's important in a relationship, for me at least. I don't want to date, let alone sleep with a man who doesn't think I'm hot shit.  I'm not asking him to shower me with praise. That's unreasonable. I just want to know my boyfriend thinks I'm pretty, and words are the way I feel most appreciated. He won't fix any insecurities I have, but it would certainly help a little",False,True

If it’s not about how you look, then why do you need to hear from him what he thinks about how you look? If you truly felt okay with your body, his opinion of it wouldn’t be a concern for you.   Thing about outside validation is that it cannot fill the black hole inside of you that is your self-worth, or lack thereof. It makes you feel better for a little bit but then you need more, because you don’t have your own internal assurance that you’re okay. You’ll always be craving outside opinions. Also it’s incredibly unattractive when you have to reassure your partner that you find them attractive, so you’re actually making your situation worse by asking him to consciously compliment your appearance. You can’t win in this situation until you learn to be comfortable in your own skin.",False,False

I really am convinced his validation will help. My struggles with restricting tend to come in waves. I used to post pics online to get validation, and that actually really subdued my ED urges, as it helped me accept my body as it was.  I don't really feel too terrible about my body right now, it's more just worrying that he specifically doesn't find me attractive. Right now a lot of it is about control and the number, as opposed to how I actually look.",False,True

When you google “how to help loved one with eating disorder” one of the top things mentioned is to NEVER comment on the person’s body, not even in a complimentary manner bc the ED brain will find a way to twist it. The advice goes on to encourage a person to only make remarks on the sufferer’s personality to help them build a sense of worth outside of your appearance. So really your BF is following textbook advice on how to support someone with an eating disorder. Maybe try and take his compliments on your personality to heart. If he didn’t find you attractive, he would be your friend, not your boyfriend. The nature of your relationship already implies mutual attraction lol let go of the idea that you need to be beautiful and sexy.",False,False

Judging from the responses you gave on other posts, you might need to have a serious talk with him and tell him your needs are not being met. His repeated promises of trying to do better and failing are not good signs nor are his excuses.  Regardless of what happens, I wish you find a fulfilling relationship.",False,False

A relationship needs to be equal. maybe this is an unpopular opinion but men aren't really raised to care about looks to the same level as women are so there's a big chance he hasn't even thought about it through his life and maybe he just assumes you know how attractive he really thinks you are without him having to tell you. Make sure he understands it's not an attack on him or that you're angry with him, just that you're in a bad place with your self confidence and you need him to help you out with making it better. It'll be okay, good luck ❤️",False,False

I'm so scared nothing will get better or he'll be upset. This I'd the first really good relationship I've been in, and we just celebrated our anniversary and I don't want to lose him.  He appreciates me for a lot of things, but I need a partner who appreciates me for how I look too.

I want his compliments to be genuine, and I don't need him to praise me all the time. But I don't get *anything* from him, genuine or not. At this point I'd take a robotic response over nothing.

If he didn't notice it the first time that's fine, maybe it isn't in his nature, but if he doesn't get better after a few tries maybe you should reconsider your worth and realise you deserve someone who meets your needs and makes you feel beautiful, loved and appreciated.",False,False

He wouldn't be with me and we wouldn't have(TMI) so much sex if he didn't.   I compliment him so much and he never returns them. I'll tell him he's absolutely stunning, he just embraces it or makes a joke. Never even says ""so are you"".   We had a talk about verbal affirmation, and he said that he feels bad when I compliment him so much and then he doesn't return it, so I told him he doesn't have to every time. I guess he took that to mean he never should return it. He says he wants to be better at expressing things, but I feel like he's making absolutely no effort.

I try going to the gym for heavy lifting when I get like this because it makes me feel like a confident, sexy, b!tch.  Truth is, appearance is a factor in relationships, so he must find you attractive if he is still with you (as shallow as that seems).

You can always talk to him too - a compliment for a compliment or even just open up to him like the other comment suggested; guys can be pretty dense sometimes.",False,False
