It's hard because people know I'm vegan and go out of their way to make dishes I can eat, which is so sweet of them and I really do appreciate it, but since I've relapsed its been impossible. Now I just make a big dish, set it out and hide for the first 20-30 minutes until they've finished eating. We have music after and I love that part, so it's not all bad but still... I think it's getting obvious to everyone that I do this. Not sure how to be more discreet, or if it's even possible. Just... Yeah. If you have any ideas that would make it less obvious, I'm all ears.",False,False

I understand the reason why food became a ritual of socialization before this times.  But today we have food available to us 24/7, it is no longer necessary to feed as a pretext to socialize or celebrate events.",False,False
