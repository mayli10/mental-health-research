It's easy to write off how horrible it is until people actually experience it and by then, it's probably crept up on them and they're used to it so they think ""this is fine"" because the fear of gaining weight is far scarier. It's the same with any other addiction. And after several years, it's just your everyday life now and it's hard to remember how you we were before, which fuels the addiction that much more because the disorder feels familiar and ""safe"".",False,False

One of my main thinspo looks is Nicole Ricci during the low points in her ED and even now at a small bit of a higher weight. She is so tiny and light. I feel so awful for that, but that is what I want to look like. I know that she has struggled so much and it is a continuous struggle for her still I am sure. Especially viewing her weight changes. I feel so bad for wanting to be something someone experiences and has so much pain from. But it a way I guess I relate to maybe some of her thought process. She is so incredibly gorgeous.",False,False

Also some people without EDs are skinnier than me lol. I don't think you need to know someone's whole story to be inspired by them.

If it was, they'd keep it to themselves.  Yep, any ""body check"" I've posted I've had to feel somewhat ok with. I wanted people to be shocked or worried bc no one irl noticed - either because I hide in baggy clothes or bc I just isolate myself or after 7 years of Anorexia people think I'm naturally skinny... It's fuel to the fire that what I'm doing is worthwhile... meanwhile I'm dizzy and weak and exhausted but I can't sleep because I'm afraid my heart might stop   I should probably stop doing that to myself and others :/",False,False

I reblog models because I like fashion but I refuse to be a thinspo account on any social media. It's not a body check. If it was, they'd keep it to themselves. They want reassurance of how skinny they are but they are dying. They probably think they're fine because they're so used to feeling the way they do. But they're dying and will die if they don't stop. I'm really trying to distance myself from thinspo shit, because it doesn't help me now, just makes me feel shittier I don't look like that. It's genuinely unrealistic unless you have a death wish. People can live a ""long"" life, but they will still die too young and miserable. I know people don't want to hear it, even now I don't want to fully believe it. But it's true, it's completely unattainable long term.",False,False
