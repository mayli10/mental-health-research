If they're going to try to guilt you into getting better it's their own fault if they end up sick. That being said, they think eating more will cure you. That once you start eating you'll just go back to normal. That's not how it works. If that was all it took it would be easy to cure eating disorders.",False,False

Doesn't have to be an aggressive thing but a simple conversation between the two of you about how it makes you feel and that you want him to stop from here on out should put an end to that situation as is. And if it doesn't then you've probably got a whole other relationship problem on your hands.   But yeah, try to talk it out if you can. Emphasize to him about how it upsets you like how you're emphasizing it to us. You can even make a little note first, a monologue of sorts to ""rehearse"" so you've got your thoughts together in case you're nervous. Dense and ignorance (I am in no way alluding to stupidity, by the way) can only go so far; if you lay it out for him, plain and simple, then he'll (hopefully) empathize with you and work on it.

And if I actually *planned* on eating that day but was essentially challenged at that moment? Then I'm definitely doing a fast out of spite. I'm a very spiteful person so this isn't just something I'm talking out of my ass and saying that I've done; I've actually done this on mumerous occasions when people try to pull this shit with me.   Like others are saying, this is usually a manipulative stunt used with the intention of backing you into a corner that your conscience won't physically let you go into. This is called playing on someone's kindness. Not *everyone* does it with ill intent since I really don't want to group people into a broad demographic or anything. I'm sure there are some people who do it that are coming from a genuine, good place with it. But be wary, OP. Because you never quite know which side of the fence that it's coming from.

Or I might just say something like 'if that worked, no one would have an eating disorder.' You could thank them for their concern if that's something you appreciate/you think they'd react well to, but make it clear that it won't work. Maybe eat something small that you feel safe about, if you're not wanting to confront them at all.  Sorry someone's doing that to you.
