Heat to steaming.  Add a couple of tablespoons of lasagna, store bought frozen stuff I make ahead and freeze in small jars so I can defrost a little at a time.  Mix for flavor and microwave another 30 seconds.  Top with a half cup of lowfat cottage cheese.  It's about 350 calories.  Not gonna kill me and it fills me up.
