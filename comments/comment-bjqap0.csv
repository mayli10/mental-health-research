And the giant middle zone of being at a healthy/reasonable weight seems mostly ignored?  I do like the idea of “regardless of what your size/weight currently is, you can make choices to maintain and improve health.” But that doesn’t seem to be how HAES gets applied (at least online).",False,False

As a piece of anecdotal evidence, I know someone who thought he was healthy because he was underweight. He had uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, but he's thin so things are fine, right? He went into two diabetic comas in his 20's before deciding to treat his condition.",False,False
