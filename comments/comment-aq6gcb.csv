Lay on your right hand side and bend your knees so youâ€™re curled comfortably. I forget what this position is called but itâ€™s used in yoga? I think? To help digestion. This is my holy grail I swear it helps me go poop, get rid of gas, eases tummy pain, everything!  2. Havenâ€™t tried this myself but another good one I hear it to lay on your back with your feet up against a wall and your bum in the corner where the wall and floor meet lmao. Helps with bloating, pain etc.",False,False
