Over summer I got into high restricting for the first time, could easily fast for 24-48 hours and eat less than 1200 a day. Now if I train hard and try to restrict even a little bit I binge the next day. This makes me not feel so guilty about that. I guess the survival part of our brains are really more powerful than we think! ",False,False

Then, instinct kicks in, just the same as how you'd jerk your hand away from a hot stove or jump out of the way of an oncoming car. Executive function is overridden by the more primitive part of the brain that cares only about surviving and BAM, welcome to Binge City. It's not your fault. It's not the result of weak will. It's not about self-control. It's just your body trying to continue to be a body. ",False,False
