When I go there I always get the same bowl (skimmed milk, rice krispies, reeseâ€™s cereal and frootloops and a topping of melted caramel), it tastes fucking amazing and the food chainâ€™s online calorie calculator says itâ€™s only 250kcal which is not that bad. Iâ€™ve been meaning to try this combination at home but Iâ€™ve been too lazy to make it, but honestly I rly think u should try it, Iâ€™m not sure what are the serving sizes there but mabey you can use smth to measure out how much of each thing ur taking and count how many calories it adds up to. The bowls are pre big and they only amount to 250kcal so Iâ€™m sure u will be able to make a satisfying amount for little calories.",False,False

Vanilla is my favorite and gives me a sweet taste I miss.",False,False

But if you do want milk, most cashew milks are only 25 calories per cup. Also, Special K Red Berries isnâ€™t calorically dense, so you get a good amount of cereal for a decent amount of calories.",False,False
