But it’s not uncommon for anorexia to become bulimia either. :/ From what you’ve said here though, it doesn’t sound like that’s what’s happening probably?   Idk. Purging sucks though. Sorry you’re dealing with those urges. And in any event, even if you’re not dx’ed as EDNOS/OSFED, it’s really pretty common to have a variety of different potential behaviors goin on when you have an ED of any sort. Try not to stress too much about specific labels and stuff. Stay safe, friend. 💛",False,False

I just feel sick and the food I just consumed feels unappetizing. It makes 0 sense in my brain but I’m too scared to ruin my teeth so I stopped purging a while ago. It’s better not to start friend, hope you feel good soon ",False,False
