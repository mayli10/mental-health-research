It's beautiful because you're not pressured to indulge in them. We're screwed when there's more vegan vendors at events.,False,False

If I know I have to be eating at a restaurant later or later in the week, I make sure I am extra restrictive and active to ""save up"" what calories I will have to eat at the restaurant and make sure if i'm going to have to eat off the menu, i will make the calories be ""worth it"" while still already feeling the anxiety and guilt of after the meal so i end up skimping out and getting a soup.",False,False

So i feel you :(",False,False
