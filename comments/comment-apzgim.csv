I recognize that I am close to being severely underweight by all standards and I know that I fit into the smallest clothing sizes possible, but I still think I look huge. On rare occasions, I will look in the mirror and think ‚ÄúDamn, look at the progress on my abs!‚Äù and within 24 hours, I will look again and I SWEAR it looks like I gained 20 pounds overnight! It is so incredibly frustrating. I know that BDD causes a lot of cognitive distortions, but sometimes I can‚Äôt tell what is real.
