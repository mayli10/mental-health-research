Today, as like other days, by 10am I've had crackers and/or added milk to my tea and/or eaten a banana/apple. I just ate a cookie, justified it saying I was good yesterday and today isn't that bad calorie-wise. It may be true, but I still feel like shit. This will be the last thing I eat today. So... maybe 500 calories?  I can stop eating. Only water and tea, at worst I only get to have milk with my tea.  Saw the Amy Winehouse documentary last night. She was bulimic from age 10 til her death. She looked fantastic. My career wouldn't last if I did the hard drugs though otherwise I would--I want to be that skinny.

The dinners are always good, I hate throwing it back up but I have a fancy gala in about 2 months, I can hit my GW by then with some restricting and purging.",False,False

I start to brew a cup of tea before sleeping off a few hours of the fast. Instead my dad calls me and DEMANDS that I take him the the car rental place to drop the rental. My mom offers to take him but insists that it has to be me. Which means he‚Äôs gonna talk about some bullshit I didn‚Äôt even know I did  wrong. I‚Äôm furious. If the tables are reversed he would yell at me for not notifying him in advance, then tell me that he couldn‚Äôt do it and say, I would need a way to figure it out myself. All I wanted was some sleep. I wouldn‚Äôt even be so mad if he would‚Äôve said when he made me say good morning twice.

There are a lot of recovering people that frequent that sub and this talk seemed so fucking triggering to me (i had honestly forgotten i was subbed). It's one thing to reject the idea that weight loss is impossible but its another thing entirely to say all women should weigh a certain weight regardless of body shape and build. Idk I'm just pissed off. Others in the sub seemed to agree that you should only be within 10 lbs of this weight. I've been trying to recover my disordered habits and unfuck my brain and I realized this sub I'm speaking of just makes me feel like I'm not good enough. Our banned ED subs never made me feel like that. Just ranting I guess.",False,False
