For example, I‚Äôve been in and out of treatments for my eating disorder but there are times when it‚Äôs not as severe. When it‚Äôs not severe I just control my symptoms more. But my eating disorder has always been there, whether it‚Äôs more severe or not.   Thank you for sharing me that. It makes me feel much better knowing your advice for learning to cope with it for a lifetime. It‚Äôs just having disordered eating for a whole lifetime is something I am so scared of and it causes me a lot of anxiety.",False,False

For instance, my dad stopped drinking 30 years ago and stayed sober 100%, but he knows to stay away from certain foods and drinks and situations that could trigger him. As long as you're aware and know your issues and limits, a mostly normal life is possible- it just takes more work than a neurotypical person has to put in.    Obviously I'm no professional, and I'm currently relapsing, so take that with a few grains of salt of course. I'm like Alice in wonderland: I give pretty good advice that I very seldom take lol",False,False

I *know* women have always had EDs into late adulthood, but it is just so much more commonly a teen/early twenties thing, at least it seems that way. Maybe that's just because that's the typical age of onset so it's more recognizable when it first starts. Sorry though.
