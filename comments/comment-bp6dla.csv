I work am working in the community nutrition field over the summer, and I volunteer in the field regularly. I wish you all the best, and keep reaching out here for support anytime you need it. :)",False,False

Unfortunately, I have no means of transportation (beyond bike + feet) and I have almost no money. That's another reason I'm struggling to eat more- I spent nearly all my money on food and I dont have enough to be supporting a high calorie diet. But I'm getting a paycheck soon (I think) and I will be headed to the cheapest store to get food.  Again thanks for your concerns",False,True

I hear that you are struggling. Two of my friends in my program are studying to be sports dietitians. It is so important to be eating enough and obtaining the right amount of nutrients to sustain your exercise. I promise I'm not on my soap box, I am genuinely concerned that you could injure yourself and not be able to compete. Having an eating disorder as an athlete can be horrendous, awful, dangerous, and every other negative word you can think of. Please take care of yourself. If you're in the US, my friend knows a place that specializes in nutrition for athletes with eating disorders.",False,False

Honestly I want to apologize to you that you felt like you had to take time out of your day to comment on my post- I feel like such an attention seeking shit face and I'm sorry you spent any time on me and my fucking shitiness,False,True

Like I'm laying in bed, every fucking fiber of my body exhausted, but I cant bring myself to even CONSIDER going near a sustainable amount. I feel so guilty for eating and for not eating enough and every day I tell myself ""you have to eat more, this bike ride isnt just for you, it's for a lot of other people so you need to stay healthy for them"" and I. Just. Can't. I spend so much time convincing myself ""eat more"" but I cant do it.   Even now my brain is telling me I need to do pushups and a core workout to maintain my arm muscles and keep working on my abs. I cant even convince myself to get out of bed to use the bathroom, but somehow I'm meant to do another workout??  I'm so tired of this. Thanks for replying, I do know I need to eat more, it's just all so confusing and guilt-ridden",False,True

It isn't binging, its sustaining your body so that it literally doesn't give out.",False,False
