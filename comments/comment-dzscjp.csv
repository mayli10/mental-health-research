They'll put stickers on you, and those are connected by wires to the machine. Then you just lay there for a few minutes, and try to breathe really, really calmly. The tech will let you know when to breathe, and when to hold still and when you can get up.",False,False

If youâ€™re a person who wears a bra, they let you keep that on. Theyâ€™ll place 10 little stickers on you â€” 5 in a little upside down rainbow below your left breast, 1 below your right breast, 1 on each arm between your shoulder and elbow, and 1 on each leg between your hip and ankle. Each sticker is connected to an electrode, and the electrodes all run back to a little box that theyâ€™ll probably either hold, rest on your body, or set on the table next to you. The test itself takes maybe 30 seconds. Theyâ€™ll hit a button, and all you have to do is lie still and breathe normally! As for your heart rate being slightly elevated â€” most doctors take that into account, since lots of people get nervous visiting the doctor. Peopleâ€™s blood pressure tends to read a few points higher in their doctorâ€™s office as well, fun fact. What theyâ€™ll be mostly interested in is the electrical functioning of your heart. Yes, bradycardia can be dangerous, but so can an arrhythmia. Sometimes ED behaviors can cause a prolonged QT interval, which can increase risk of sudden cardiac arrest. I hope this helps, and hopefully, your ECG reads normal, and the test go smoothly for you without causing too much anxiety!",False,False
