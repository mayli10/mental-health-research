If you really do want to go workout, than go do so. No-one's gonna be upset at you. You have to put yourself first, that's what I had to learn how to do.",False,False

It sounds like you know where some of the trouble lies. If they know you have BPD they should be pretty understanding about the need for reassurance. Maybe on a day where your symptoms arent as strong or you feel the strength to do so, just have everyone sit down together for a discussion and ask them to go out of their way to show support and help you out even if it doesnt LOOK like you're struggling. I totally get if you dont want to do that, it's not fun, theres always a chance something like that could backfire, but it is a potential solution that, if it works out, could help bring you some piece of mind",False,False

He likes it when I go. He think's it's cool and great and thinks I look really hot in my gym clothes. I've really projected my fear of abandonment onto him so even when he says it's fine I just keel thinking but what if he's lying or changes his mind?,False,True

I think I'm really projecting a lot of my own fears onto him. He's never said I can't go or he doesn't want me to. He thinks it's hot when I go to the gym and loves just seeing me in my gym clothes. But despite that support I still hold myself back because of this fear that suddenly he will change his mind orget upset. I know he won't but I just can't seem to bring myself to do what's best for me.,False,True

I just let that few of abandonment rule me too much at times. And the living situation is new, so even though I've known these people for years and they're great I get scared that it will change with the change of environment.",False,True

Everyone around me right now is super supportive and are really pushing me to put myself first when it comes to certain things. They know I have trouble setting boundaries and I get overwhelmed. I just have a bad habit where I don't trust that they'll let me do that stuff...even though they constantly tell me I should and it's good for me. The borderline just makes me too scared to do my own thing sometimes. Most of the time lol,False,True

So I understand that you feel like you have to please everyone first. BUT (this is cheesy) in things like recovering from an ED, or healthily losing weight (if you are obese, yes you should lose weight. Does not make you ""less of a person"" it just means your health is likely at risk) you have to be a little bit selfish. If your bf says ""no stay and watch more TV with me"" just say ""we already watched some TV, I want to get a workout in, and then I'll come back and see you again"" and if he cant handle that, it might be too codependent of a relationship.   Idk, all I'm saying is, its okay to put yourself first with a thing like this. If you have to do something for you, do it. Say ""sorry but this is for my health, not for how I look""  Idk, I hope that helps",False,False

I still hate myself but i present myself more confidently, which means people have more respect for your worth and accept it more when you say “i am going to do this” rather than always letting yourself be dragged into what others want to do just because we want to feel desired and want people to like us.",False,False
