I never was involuntarily committed. After I said what I was thinking my therapist would ask if I thought I could be safe if I went home and I always said yes.,False,False

They can't \*force\* you unless you are considered a legit danger to yourself or others -- in which case, it would be an involuntary admission.   But they can strongly encourage you to go -- but that's not the same thing as forcing you to go.",False,False

I think it has to be pretty imminent too—like you mention wanting to kill yourself or others—not just that you’re generally endangering yourself by not eating well.,False,False

When I was in therapy it was through an outpatient ED clinic. She did end up having me involuntarily hospitalized because of my ED.   I think therapy is great though and it’s the one thing I miss from the program since I quit shortly after my hospitalization.   In general though, I think most therapists can have you committed if they believe you’re a danger to yourself or to others.",False,False
