We *know* logically that it's not healthy, but it's an addiction and addictions don't like to listen to logic.   I'm sorry that your SO's weight loss has exacerbated your own struggles, unintentionally. If you haven't already talked to them about it, and if you feel secure enough with them at this point in your relationship, maybe try opening up about it to them. Venting a little can be therapeutic, and if there's anything you think they can do to help you, let them know - even if you're not ready to recover yet, there's no harm done in having a little extra support from those close to you.  If it helps, you're not alone in these kind of feelings. My husband is literally more than double my weight, soft and squishy and I'm more than okay with it - but if he loses even a few pounds suddenly I feel like I need to be even smaller too. It's not that I'm upset with him or he's insensitive or anything, it's just like an instinctual *need* to be ""less"" that makes no real sense. And the feeling of wanting to be better but also not wanting to gain any weight... yeah. The mental struggle is real, man.",False,False
