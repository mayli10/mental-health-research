You deserve to eat when you are hungry. Never punish yourself for engaging in a very normal activity like eating a brownie and taking part. This disorder is an isolating monster - bat it off. If you're hungry before you planned to eat it, eat it! Don't sit for hours watching the clock until you're 'allowed' to eat. You can re-write the rules/take them away whenever you want. Sending you healthy vibes! Today was a good day!!!!",False,False

Try to fight those thoughts. You made progress by eating it and not letting 'rules' around eating stop you. You won't gain a single thing in weight, but you will gain a lot emotionally if you don't let the ed win.",False,False
