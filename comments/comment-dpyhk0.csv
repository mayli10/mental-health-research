Usually, the only things I have to lose are money, time, and my ED behaviors. As far as money and time go, I look at it as an investment and consider what I’d do with that time and money if I didn’t go (usually, buy food to binge and purge or buy alcohol to self destruct).  As for the behaviors, those are what I’m trying to change to begin with. So in that respect it’s well worth the potential “losses” given the possible gains (recovery).  So. That said, I’ve been on a couple of meds - fluoxetine, sertraline, lisdexamfetamine, and bupropion (the latter two when I was with psychiatrists who had no idea what they were doing with an ED patient) - and none of them did jack shit for me in terms of recovery (lisdexamfetamine enabled me to restrict, and bupropion gave me seizures, yay).   But I do know a number of people who really benefited from both fluoxetine and sertraline, not as magical fix-all’s but as a way to help regulate emotions and make it easier to do the work of recovery.   If you can afford the cost of the consultation and medication, I say go for it - just make sure you’re working with someone experienced with EDs.",False,False
