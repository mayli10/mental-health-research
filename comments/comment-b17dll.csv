I wish I could change your circumstances for you. heck, I wish I could change the general injustices in our culture that made those circumstances possible. but I hope at the very least you don’t let this instance anchor you in negativity or feel like anything has been undone. and despite the inequity, congrats on the raise/bonus — it sounds like you have been working hard both at work and at internal challenges. like you, i lurked here for months and find a lot of strength and comfort from reading people’s similar stories, emotions, triggers... I’m hoping tomorrow is a much better day for you &lt;3",False,False
