emwu4vo,t3_bmibar,t1_emwts7t,mossalto,1,2019-05-09 06:45:59,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bmibar/i_hate_the_metric_system/emwu4vo/,"I think it depends if you're going up or down - at least for me. Losing 2lbs for every kg (roughly) is great, but gaining 2lbs is worse.  I find it more satisfying and rewarding watching the numbers going down in lbs I guess?",False,True
emwts7t,t3_bmibar,t3_bmibar,DevoidCherry,1,2019-05-09 06:41:14,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bmibar/i_hate_the_metric_system/emwts7t/,I prefer the metric system bc it‚Äôs not so sensitive to fluctuations  Waking up 43.0kg and going to bed 43.4kg seems fine  Waking up 95lbs and going to bed at 96lbs seems like it would fuck with my head. Plus how easy it would be to reach 100lbs by being alive omg no thank u,False,False

Doing that calculation and then realising that to drop just 1 stone you have to lose over 6kg or 14lbs...I'd rather have the bigger number thanks,False,True
