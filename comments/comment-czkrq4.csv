The scale is a huge factor.. It’s still in my home but I haven’t weighed myself nearly as much as before this summer. So that’s one step I guess!",False,True

This was lovely to read. Admittedly I’m kinda jealous lol but hopefully I’ll find my “thing” that makes staying recovered and fighting my relapses a less daunting task.

Focus on making these changes for you. I'm not saying he's going anywhere but actively have a game plan - different strategies you could try if for some reason it doesnt work out, but that would keep you eating this way for you.  Can I also recommend eliminating a scale from your home while you recover? I know that can be a huge step.  I'm 1 month ""recovered"" right now but the man who keeps me on track just got deployed and I have been so close to relapse it *hurts.* He will come home to me but I still need to be able to control it while hes gone.",False,False

I’m in the same boat as well! Im actually starting to eat sweets in moderation and not bingeing. I want a muffin? You bet I’m going to have that muffin.
