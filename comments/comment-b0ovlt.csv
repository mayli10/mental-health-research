IT sounds like your body is reaching to having been at a low BMI --- that symptom switching is common --- and if it FEELS compulsive and out of control you deserve help. Try the book ""brain over binge"" which is awesome, and see a doctor or a therapist. You deserve to be taken seriously.",False,False

Can you go to your doctor for a checkup and mention it? Be honest about bingeing, and he or she can help explain to your parents that even though you are still a healthy weight, there is cause for concern.   As a little comfort to you, know that 21 bmi isn't  that close overweight! If you can overcome this behavioral struggle, you will be okay. It probably feels like a big change up from 17, and gaining can be upsetting, but know that this is still a healthy place for your body to be, and I encourage you to put that fear and pain to the side so you can focus on getting better mentally.",False,False

There can be hormonal reasons that prompt bingeing, too, and they could help you rule out a physical cause.",False,False
