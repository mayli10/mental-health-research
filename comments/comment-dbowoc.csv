A massive achievement, you might not feel it now but you should be proud.   Also, remember that at the end of the day assholes will be assholes regardless of what weight you are.  Your mom sounds extremely unsupportive. I have no idea what she is playing at shaming you while you are in recovery, or ever actually.  I think you should go for your fitness goals, yes some days you might still feel sad and hopeless, no one can guarantee you won't, but I bet you will have more good days than bad. ðŸ’™ðŸ’™ðŸ’™",False,False
