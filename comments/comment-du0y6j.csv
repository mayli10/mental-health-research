I think it’s a combination of fearmongering over the idea that counting calories causes eating disorders (but for some reason being a gluten free, sugar free, soy free paleo vegan is fine), the idea that counting calories doesn’t work, and the idea that the only people who should be doing it are those who “look” like they need to lose weight. And so it’s seen as a really extreme thing for normal BMI people to do even though there’s nothing wrong with it and it’s just a tool to help understand what you’re consuming.  People who don’t have EDs can and do count calories without anything bad happening (but of course, for people who do have EDs, it’s not a great idea to continue to engage with that behavior long term).",False,False

For people with disordered eating/eating disorders (or the disposition) it can be a problem.  Many people get triggered by counting calories, in that case it's not a good idea to continue it.  Some people don't and then it's fine to count calories.  If you are not sure how you react you can try to not count them for a while, to see if you have less disordered thoughts.  It really is just a tool, but you shouldn't use a tool that makes your illness worse.",False,False
