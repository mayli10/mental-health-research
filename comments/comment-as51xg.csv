I tend to be attracted to guys that are more slim. (Which is not generally a ‚Äòdesirable‚Äô trait for men, but is more so than being overweight) Personality does far outdo looks in my opinion.  Also, I think that being skinnier or a little squishier are both still attractive when at a healthy weight.   Emphasis on healthy weight! Seems like what is considered healthy versus what people want to see as healthy are different.  I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and at 143lbs I was almost overweight. Most of my friends would scoff at me for wanting to lose weight because I was already ‚Äònot fat‚Äô. I was the upper limit of healthy weight and most people saw me as not fat at all.  I can potentially get down to 110lbs and still be a healthy weight. I would look drastically different and be very skinny, but still perfectly healthy.  So when people find fat unattractive vs skinny, that skinny person is likely still a healthy weight while the fat person is less likely to be.   As for a much smaller group of people glamorizing super skinny people, people do this for fat people as well.   People can get mad at me all they want. I think it is great for people to be happy in their own bodies, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just that our threshold for being fat is higher and perfectly healthy people that are skinny are called anorexic and underweight when they aren‚Äôt.",False,False
