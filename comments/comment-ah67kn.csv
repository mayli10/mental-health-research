I've never seen anyone who looks like this image. And when I'm struggling we talk back and forth, she reminds me how weak I am, how much better I felt when I was smaller, how I got things I wanted so much easier when she was in charge. She asks me to let her out to play, just for a little while, and when I give in it's 300 calorie days and staring in the mirror pinching my fat to remind myself how disgusting I am. If I'm looking at food and considering buying/ eating it, she asks if I really need that? 70 calorie of cheese? Why? Put it back fat b***h, I'm in charge today. I know she's not real real, I know it's my own thoughts, but she's also.... separate from me, I guess? I sound loony, lol. ",False,False

Not my own mother but of a woman far superior to me. It's a voice that constantly tells me no. It interrupts my thoughts to have something to eat but does not always win. Most of the time I listen. Sometimes we collide and it sends me into a panic, gives me headaches and anxiety. She's not mean, but does not care to listen to me. 9/10 times I lose. And whilst in the moment, It makes me feel crazy, in the end I would not have lost weight without it. My ED voice and my depression voice are one in the same. The only difference is my depression voice IS mean. Depression voice is very ruthless and reminds me why ED voice is there in the first place. I wish I were overreacting about this.

Me: Wtf, it‚Äôs a nice day, I‚Äôm not going to think about this right now.
