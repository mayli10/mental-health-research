It validates that you belong. The invalidation for me stems from issues of wanting to be perfect and feeling like I dont belong so admitting and seeing that I am not and don't have to be perfect along with addressing that I do indeed belong in this world as a human even if I dont meet my own standards of perfection because I have human needs and emotions like everyone else was huge and eye opening. Hope this helps.,False,False
