And I really try not to justify ""oh water weight or baby weight or the holidays"" because I'm trying to be firm on myself for myself. If I justify this or that then I'll spiral back into more. But self forgiveness is important, and water weight is a real thing, and all set backs or a little overating is to be expected. So I have to try to keep focus without zooming in on one bad day or bad choice. It helps me to have a journal of an overall picture. Where I record the weekly calories compared to prior weeks, and especially to the calories I used to consume at my gianormous weight. While about ~60% of my days are calories under for ultimate goal weight, ~20% a little over or way over, and the remaining fasting. It evens out over so I see the big picture and I don't get stuck crying and hating myself because I'm focused on one crooked line. I also try to consider the weight I really am to be the weight after a long fast and taking laxatives to clear out water weight. I had fasted for about 35 hours, weighed myself, then took a laxative with water, waited about 4-6 hours to clear out, then took my weight and it came 2 pounds less than that morning and that's the weight I can consider to be my actual weight.   Another thing that helps is me mentally separating myself from my ED brain or my borderline personality brain. While yes, these things are just as much me as I am, they are also as much NOT me. So I directly talk to that part of me as if it were different, as if it were a paranoid and neurotic roommate. Like, ""Bitch could you STOP obsessing? You KNOW it's water weight. How about you focus on the fact we're so sore from that hellish workout we did yesterday? Don't you feel in the soreness the strength we really are building? And yes, I too am upset about this extra 3 pounds I don't think should be here either, but I'm not going to let this blob of 3 pounds make me think there isn't weight to be lost beyond it. And if this 3 pounds thinks it can fuck with us and make us too scared and sad to pursue our ultimate goal then we're gonna show that bitch. Like just think of how pissed off this fat is gonna be when we start swimming and running, we're gonna corner this dumb ass weight so it has no where to go but out. I got this, you got this, we are two parts of a whole one that's gonna make it."" Whatever negative voice that resides in you, personify that voice and talk mad motivational shit to it. Then when it comes back within you it will be more soothed, and you will have more clarity. ",False,False

It's probably just water weight obviously, but the ED brain is stupid. I'll try to just let myself have my tiny victories though. ❤️",False,True

I understand how you feel, but if you can you can look at this as you've set the calories with a safety net. You are in your success range, and you continue to plan and follow through with more successes. Try to focus on the positives and the strength you have, do not feed the wallowing or negativity because it gives it strength to drag you back. You are more than overcoming your body, you are overcoming your mind. You got this, you are more of a success than you believe. ❤️",False,False
