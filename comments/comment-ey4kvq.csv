It made a huge difference in my recovery. Get a new therapist. Now story. A good counselor who knows you well would never buy into something like that and may even wonder about mom's state of mind. I am sorry you are going through this. I had an extremely bad counselor and I did not realize how bad she was until I started seeing a new one. I am in an emotionally abusive relationship. I saw the bad therapist for 3 years. I would tell her things that were happening in this relationship. She told me once in session she would only consider still seeing me if I stopped talking about my relationship. I finally stop seeing bad therapist and went to see the the good therapist. Who has been working with me for about 6 months now. In one of our sessions she told me what I described is going on in my current relationship is emotional abuse. And apparently it is in the record from the couples counseling that I did with my boyfriend with a different therapist also states that my boyfriend is possibly emotionally abusive. Possibly because we only did 5 sessions together.,False,False
