But all the kids and most of the teachers at my middle/high school knew, for sure.",False,True

Last year I hid my AN so well, but I gave up. One of my super close best friends found out and then told a bunch of people. I didn’t know who knew and didn’t know, so I just talked about it. Like, I’m not going to shove it down people’s throats but I bring it up from time to time. Also no one has seen me eat since May, so if they didn’t figure it out before they certainly know now. Yeah, once you reach a certain amount of time with the disorder it becomes less and less important to hide. Every now and then someone has genuine concern but I always shut it down. It sucks, but oh well.",False,False

I talk very openly about my anxiety and depression as well. Mental health issues need to be talked about. The stigma needs to be destroyed. I was born with or developed these issues just like someone born with one leg longer than the other or someone who gets arthritis. I didn’t ask for it. It happened to me. I’m just trying to fucking cope and live my life like everyone else. And if coping for me is calorie counting and planning meals out days in advanced, that’s how it is. If coping is me taking 4 different herbal supplements and an anxiety medication I actively call my crazy pills to people, then that how it is. If coping is me walking my dog 3-5 miles a day, that’s how it is. Just like if someone has diabetes and they watch their insulin, someone with shoulder issues has to do rehab exercises, or someone with bad vision wears contacts or glasses.",False,False

I sorta want people to know that no, I don't have a magical metabolism that allows me to stay slender and muscular. I restrict my calories to 1000+ deficit a day and work out every single fucking day.   You, too, could have this body for the small, small price of your sanity. No, Karen, I wasn't ""born like this"" or ""blessed with a great metabolism!"" and I'm not ""so lucky!"" that i am thin. I worked for this.",False,True

I want people to know I didn't just win this body in the lottery, it takes starving, anxiety, depression and self hatred to maintain it.",False,False
