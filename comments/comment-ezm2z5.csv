So, a good call on your part ;) I think from people without mental illness there can be this reaction of ""You're such a smart person, why don't you understand how illogical these choices are?"" Often I *do* see that these behaviors aren't helpful, but there's a powerful disconnect between my intellectual understanding and my emotional experience.   The behaviors are not really even the primary thing for me - it's a symptom of my trying to cope with life. From an outside perspective it looks like ""Why are you using X in response to Y when X doesn't actually solve Y? But I'm actually using X in response to some emotional distress Z, and in the short term it probably does help with Z. (Though often destructive or ineffective in the long term.)  Probably a wayy more loquacious response than you were looking for, lol, but thought I'd throw it out there.",False,False

Understandable though, i can see how that would feel like the right choice if you were in that position. Thanks for the response.",False,True

The behaviors and the emotions driving the behaviors are not always totally rational or reasonable. That's just part of the gig. For me it's driven by an emotional 'logic' and emotional needs. The need to feel empty. The need to feel clean. The need to do \*something\* in response to the food I put into me.",False,False

I thought maybe it had something to do with getting rid of the food before it digested fully but couldn't find any studies suggesting that was a thing.",False,True
