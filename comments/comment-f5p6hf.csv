I can tell you that it's a good idea to tell your psychiatrist. Yes, they'll probably weigh you, but that's just to start tracking your weight because it's required for documentation. If the psych has any ED experience, they'll ask questions about your behaviors and they'll understand that your weight alone doesn't mean you have or don't have an eating disorder. You're valid regardless of your weight. If you have any specific questions, ask away.",False,False

It did make them take my other mental health issues much more seriously as I went from BMI 25.8 to abt 19,False,False

I bawled my eyes out during my ecg to the nurse. I know how you feel, the whole “how dare I ask for help from an eating disorder when I don’t weigh x” ask for the help, don’t wait. This is the lonliest, suckiest self debilitating disease. Get the help, don’t be like me at almost 33 still punishing yourself 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕",False,False

I hope you have a better experience than me. I was only weighed by my gp after breaking down for my referral to a public ED resource. I got weighed again at my consultation to the unit. They also take bloods, ecg. I keep getting told I’m “medically healthy” so 😢",False,False
