For YEARS. Can my mom seem to remember that? Nope. Every time we're over and she offers tea or coffee she always asks what I want in it (not mad about that - people change sometimes right?) but what gets me is no matter what she ALWAYS puts milk in tea. I'm not sure if it's just habit that even tea without sugar needs milk but. just. NO. Even if I say specifically no milk please she'll still do it half the time and I just sort of fake nurse it and then dump it. I really love my mom and I don't want her to be offended.  I try to just make it myself or ask for coffee now. ,False,False
