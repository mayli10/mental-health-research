They deflate and go back to normal a few days after I stop. Not sure if actual muscle is being built or if I’m helping to maintain what’s still there. You could weigh less but still look much bigger than someone who is heavier but has more muscle/less body fat so try not to beat yourself up over it xx measurements are more indicative than weight imo.,False,False
