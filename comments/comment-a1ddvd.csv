It's when my ED started actually. I started to loose weight, and then I had a chemo protocol with cortisol which meant I had to reduce sugar and salt intake, and lost even more weight and became a bit obsessed with being extremely thin. I hate to say this, but I also think a part of me wanted to look sick and get some compassion. The number of times people told me, ""sure you have cancer, but like you could be more sick come on, you're still alive""... I hope you're doing better, and fully in recovery &lt;3 Sending happy thoughts &lt;3 &lt;3 ",False,False
