I don't have anything at home and everything closes super early here.   I'm in Luxembourg, maybe your brand has a copycat here so feel free to drop the name :)   I definitely need something to balance my potassium level, I will drop by a pharmacy tomorrow to see if they have a tablet to help with magnesium AND potassium and investigate in the supermarket nearby.   If I can't find that tomorrow, are there some foods that can help in the short term?",False,True

Get a bottle of magnesium citrate and start adding a spoonful to your water once a day, and get some No-salt from the grocery store to sprinkle on your food for potassium.",False,False

Nerve tingling and muscle spasms are both warning signs of electrolyte imbalance.  Don't add pure salt (sodium) to your water, that would mess up your electrolyte balance even more and just make the potassium deficiency worse. Instead you should look for a ""healthy"" branded table salt at your grocery store, one that is made up of at least 50% potassium. The brand I use is only sold here in Finland, but it's made of 50% potassium, 40% sodium and 10% magnesium.  If I've purged during the day, before going to sleep in the evening I dilute half a teaspoon of this salt into a glass of water and follow that up with a glass or two of just normal tap water. I find electrolyte supplementing to get rid of headaches, improve my general mood and not make me as lethargic.",False,False
