I was always a chubby kid, but I grew up in a house where my mom forbid any kind of weight talk/comments/diet talk or diet culture so I honestly never really realized how chubby I was. I know now that she did this because my grandma, my aunt and now me have the exact same ED problems. No joke, it's like copy and paste. My mom grew up with that and didn't want it anywhere near me, if they showed disordered behaviors/made comments, they weren't allowed to see me. But I quit all sports when I was 15, started running on my own, lost a few pounds unintentionally, and it was all downhill from there. The feeling of weight loss, of restriction, is euphoric, that feeling is what I struggle with. I went back to school after summer break and I was treated like a weight loss goddess, which just fueled me even more.   What keeps me from recovering? My thighs. What fuels my recovery? I love my grandma, I love my aunt. I dont want this to haunt me and rule my life like it's ruled theirs. After her stroke, my grandma kept collapsing because she refused to eat anything but romaine lettuce. And I get it. I totally get why, she was terrified, she could of died if my grandpa hadn't found her, so she went back to her safe space of ED. But her safe space led her to enteral feeding and constant passing out, and made her stroke recovery so so much harder.  I don't want that to be me.",False,False

I'm not completely sure but my family was never super happy with my weight and I'd get told that I needed to be healthier which actually just meant lose weight to them. I don't think I ever had a good relationship with food. I remember at 10 just comparing my body to other girls and being relieved if they were bigger. I know I do it for vanity reasons and maybe control but I heard it could be because of genetics? Idk lol but it doesn't matter because regardless I'm dealing with it.,False,False
