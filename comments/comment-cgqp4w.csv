I don’t blame her ‘cause her mom is equally critical without thinking things through. But this really triggered me today - because it’s a serious disorder and can lead to death.,False,True

It’s really ridiculous that they can not understand something as simple as CICO.   My dad especially thinks that depression is not a real thing. I don’t think he meant to, but when a family friend was so depressed they didn’t even want to go out of the house, my dad was so confused. He was like “What’s wrong with you, just get out of the house and do something, get a hobby.”  My dad is a good person, but he is old-fashioned. He generally is a gluttonous person, so he always brings home more than a necessary amount of food, like bakery items, chips, fried chicken. So, it’s not a big surprise that he has diabetes.  I get really annoyed when my dad lectures me that I need to eat more, like no offense, but I think you should look after your own health. My dad finally has improved his diet a little due to almost becoming blind in one eye.",False,False
