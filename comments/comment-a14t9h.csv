I had a pair of jeans I wore when I was 15-16 that fit me so well and made my legs look so slim and they were just perfect in every way. I used to refer to them as my magic jeans because I could always get a guy's attention in them ðŸ™ƒ I wore them until they were threadbare and couldn't be patched up anymore, and then I went through a period of recovery and went up 4 pant sizes. I'm finally back down to that size (i carry most of my weight in my thighs so this was a huuuuge deal) and just the other day I was wondering how they would look on me now ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",False,False

I'm about a year and a half on testosterone atm, and basically all my oversized clothes make me super sad now. Most of my favorite clothes are too big and make me feel like a giant gross weirdo and it sucks ass.   Alternatively, the socks I obtained from 6 psych wards over the course of 2.5 years are getting holes and it makes my brain flip out (haven't been to one in 3 years, so they're all pretty old). Like. I'm freaking out over hospital socks? Really?",False,False
