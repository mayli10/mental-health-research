Yeah, they don't pop out of nowhere. I ""wasn't like that"", ""didn't have an actual disorder"" and ""wouldn't let it get out of hand"" at one point. I was just ""borrowing the behavior"" ""like a tool, really"" and ""I could stop right now if I wanted to"".  If that sounds familiar at all, please don't delude yourself. I feel dumb now and it would've been easier to focus on getting better if I'd admitted sooner that even a not-Real problem was a Problem.",False,False

I don't have an eating disorder though, just make sure I avoid eating as much as I can. I don't like that this is the way I react either, but its better than what my alternative will be, since starving is less noticeable by my family.
