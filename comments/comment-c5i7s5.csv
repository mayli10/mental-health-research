Honestly it seems kinda rude. I don‚Äôt know the context or anything, but maybe you could ask her to take it down? I hate when people post pics of me cause I have body dysmorphia and I feel super self conscious.",False,False

For some reason it is so much more difficult to talk about my ED. I think it‚Äôs because my ED brain wants to do everything to protect itself. In some sense, restricting eases my anxiety so the idea of talking about it and maybe starting to recover honestly kinda freaks me out. So I totally get it. But I think talking about it will help overall with stuff. It‚Äôs easier to give advice than to take it. Honestly I should probably listen to my own advice more üòÇ",False,False

I know what it is like to feel what you are feeling. I wish I could do more to help. Just know that you have people out there who know know what you are going through. You are not alone-even if it feels like it sometimes. This disorder will take everything from you. Hold onto what you have. Don‚Äôt give up. It‚Äôs easier said than done, but hang in there and try to reach out for help professionally. Just talking to someone will help. I hope things get better for you soon. üíñ",False,False
