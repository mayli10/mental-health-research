I think, for me, what makes 'recovery overeating' different (or at least more mentally tolerable lol) from disordered bingeing/behaviours is  \- putting food into proper bowls/plates/cups before eating (instead of eating directly from the package). sounds a bit silly but it reinforces the sense that I'm actively making a choice to eat it, and allowing myself to do so  \- trying not to compensate after overeating, and reminding myself that I don't need to do so because it's normal for my body to need a lot of food after a period of restriction  \- doing opposite actions (against what the disordered part of me wants me to do), learning to eat more and eat more consistently in general, restricting less, etc. it teaches my brain that food isn't scarce and I don't have to binge all the time   I'm a while into 'recovery' and I find that as I eat more and compensate less, I gradually feel less hungry and it takes fewer calories to satisfy me compared to before, when I'd need a crazy amount every day.   I'm afraid that if your body is at an energy deficit (plus your metabolism might be slow after restriction) then intuitive eating would involve some weight gain, friend :( but as you learn to eat intuitively and build a healthier relationship with food, your body image would likely also get better. I know it's hard to believe, but it's at least been true for me and a few other people I've talked to, and I think many people online say so too. the things that the eating disorder cares about will slowly matter less.   stay strong, friend. good luck. youre beautiful either way &lt;3",False,False
