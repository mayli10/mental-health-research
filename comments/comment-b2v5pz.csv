Like ya, it *may* kind of be a purge, but its not an *ED purge* at least.      Ive very rarely tried to make myself throw up for weight loss reasons. Usually its just because I ate to much and feel physically nauseous and like I have a stomach full of razor blades to the point where even a tiny sip of water fills my *entire stomach* with razor blades. Usually just some slime will come up but nothing more, so I don‚Äôt bother.",False,False

And tbh I used to think that I could never force myself to throw up but then I found a way to (which then caused me to develop my bulimia) so I‚Äôd definitely not recommend it haha,False,True

Like it‚Äôs good to reframe it in my mind as me just getting rid of something bad (whatever upset my stomach) vs something technically good for me (food). I really appreciate you sharing the kind words!! They‚Äôre super helpful to me.   Also tysm!! I‚Äôm really proud of how long I‚Äôve been able to be purge free (I went from purging literally every day for months to this so I‚Äôm really happy!). Everyone‚Äôs different though, and I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôll be able to break the cycle soon too! I believe in you!",False,True

A few weeks ago I genuinely needed to throw up after eating something that was seriously upsetting my stomach, but was unsure if I should count it as breaking my streak.
