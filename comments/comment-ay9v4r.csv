That's a really cool and important area of study! Do you have any plans for after you get your degree? Like will you be teaching, or an activist, or go into politics?   But yeah, Women's Day is huge, and I'm really glad it exists and things are changing, if too slowly for my taste.",False,False

I understand what you mean.   I didn't participate on the women's day, I had to work and that was too important. But, yes, I think it is a very important day, and I am quite impressed of how it seem to grow bigger, since Metoo. I engage in politics on gender and intersectionality (thats what I study) and I like how that day reflect in society what people think of it.",False,True

I just think it's really cool how native languages pop up like that sometimes and when I catch it it feels like almost an inside joke between me and the other person. I speak and hear English 97% of the time so when I see Spanish in any context I get excited!   Do you mind if I ask why you're interested in International Women's Day demonstrations? Are you participating, too?",False,False

I'm not comfortable answering your questions but I just wanted to ask: are you a native Spanish speaker? I ask because you said ""manifest"" like manifestar, instead of the more common English ""protest"". Not judging, just curious! I'm Hispanic living in the US, so I'm wondering what your situation is if true!",False,False
