Maybe show him pictures from your low weights and explain the process that leads you to ricochet between 98 and 185.   Also lay down some boundaries eg - don’t comment on how much I’ve had to eat. Don’t comment on my weight, on anyone’s weight in front of me. Don’t encourage me to eat more or less, offer food once only.   I hope he starts being responsible about this. It’s incredibly dangerous for you to have someone whose opinion is so important to you encouraging disordered behavior.   If you keep trying to get through to him and he continues to make comments like that, decide if he’s healthy for you overall. I hope you let him go if he’s not good for you. ",False,False

If you can, that might help. Explain to him that you don’t need his help/advice in the weight loss department, that you just want someone to listen to you. If he reacts well to that, congratulations! You’ve got a good one.  If he insists on telling you to try fasting and all that, run for the hills, nothing good will come out of this relationship I GUARANTEE you. Congratulations, you just lost 170 pounds of dead weight.  If you’re not ready to have that talk with him, maybe just kindly tell him his advice is not welcome. I wish you all the best,",False,False
