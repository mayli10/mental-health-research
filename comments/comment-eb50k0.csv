Once I entered my numbers I was able to save a shortcut of the webpage to my phone and it saves my values. Sooo much better than whatever app I was using.,False,False

If you want the ""most precise"" number, just plug the formula into [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).    If you want to keep track overtime I would do it in excel. Here's an example:  [Example day, weight](https://imgur.com/a/Y3PLTo1)  You write in your weight and the date ( I've set height at 62in btw), and then you select the M2 cell to write your BMI formula, which will look like:  = 703*L2/(62)^2  This will turn the M2 cell into the BMI for that day (20.117 in my example). You can select the bottom right corner of the M2 cell and drag down to the M4 cell which will keep the formula but use the next days weight and height.  Hope this helps.",False,False

If you use kg and meters it wouldn’t be difficult kg/m^2   I did it so often so I remembered my height squared with all the decimal points!,False,False

I also just ran a table out of my weight at a bunch of BMI numbers since that speculative checking was what I seemed to do the most.,False,False
