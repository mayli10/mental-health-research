I honestly think that EDs are partly about self harm.  Sure, eating 1200 calories a day is plenty (groan) and would lead to less of this rollercoaster that is ED.  But balanced, healthy eating doesn't provide the pleasure of pain that comes from the exhausting yet delirious hunger of restriction, the sublime self-hatred of binging, or the physical pain of purging after a binge.  I need to hate myself.  Fasting, restricting, binging, purging all help to achieve my goal of hating myself from the inside out.",False,False
