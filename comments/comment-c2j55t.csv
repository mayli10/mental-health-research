There will always be the not-so-great days; when I'm having one, I always feel like it's some kind of new reality and I'm never going to get better.  But then there are the OK days and the good days.  :-)",False,False

Thoughts: spent tattoo days eating the way I normally do which meant instant gratification, ice cream and bready carbs. Just as I wa getting up to make food this afternoon, my husband came in and said he was getting a sub and wondered if I wanted anything from the gas station. I said no thanks. However, the minute he was out the door my brain was screaming, ""you could have had all the food!!!"" To hurry up and get something in me I had a to-go bowl of Basil pesto quinoa from aldis. It wasn't bad. It also wasn't good. My husband makes the very best pesto in the entire world so my taste buds are biased, I'm sure. Overall though it would be good to keep in my desk at work as a safe food.",False,True

(I remember texting everyone I knew that I actually ate a ruben) And I learned that trying something new won't actually kill me. Spaghetti squash is one of my new favorite foods, especially with marinara and grilled chicken.  Thanks for the well wishes! I did what were all do which was make unwise choices when we fell like we're winning. Wtf? I literally gave a fridge full of food and a meal plan I'm not scared of, but what the hell, I'll eat a whole pan of cinnamon rolls and 3/4 of a package of cookies. I haven't eaten yet today but topping this all out helps me remember to take care of myself. Thank you ðŸ§¡",False,True

Thoughts: Feeling accomplished. It seems like a lot of food but it really fills me up without feeling gross. My go-to for breakfast is gas station sandwich or pizza or to basically eat a while box of cereal over the course of an hour or so.
