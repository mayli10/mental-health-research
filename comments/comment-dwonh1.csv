Especially for thanksgiving week with the family. HELL YEAH NO BINGES FOR EITHER OF US THIS WEEK. SO PROUD OF US!!! I know going over can be hard to cope with bc same BUT YOU DIDNT BINGE AND IM SO PROUD !! I went over a little over today, but not a binge, and no purge!

Today was very stressful for me, but it was also a very good day and the urge to binge was so strong because of that. I was actually sat debating whether or not I should for a good ten minutes and somehow it just clicked for me that the feelings that come after are so not worth it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I kept debating for a good while after even when I was making myself a healthier option lol. I think it helped that I identified the trigger, which happened to not only be stress but excitement and happiness itself (which I hadn‚Äôt realized up until this point). Today I did attend a dinner so I tried my best to stay in my limit and not psych myself out by thinking that the meal would ruin all my progress (also a trigger). I just feel really good.
