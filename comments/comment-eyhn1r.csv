You don’t use it like a regular paste but kinda run it in and leave it on so it remineralises toothys   I felt really shy telling my dentist about my loooong history of purging in the past, but you know what? She could already tell. They can tell!! It makes a specific wear pattern on our teeth that’s only cause by super bad reflux or you guessed it.   Plus I kinda think even though it’s scary better to go full disclosure, that way they can help you make a plan to minimise the damage.   Best of luck to you and your toothy pegs!   Oh on a good note, my teeth are broken AF but only from the bottom half down, so that’s kinda a win? Lol",False,False

I needed to hear something like that.   I'm fortunate enough to live in a country where dentists are mostly covered up by insurance. At least to a part. I have an appointment soon and I'm planning on being straight up honest but I'm absolutely terrified about telling him.   I have a solid variety of toothpastes but I've never heard about a mousse. Is that something specific?  I also hope you're doing well. Have some hugs x,False,True

It could be worse, I wish dentists where not so expensive.",False,False
