You might be referred to a psychiatrist or ED specialist, or but probably they'll just give you meds. In my experience and what my psychiatrist says is that weight gain from antidepressants is caused by increased hunger not actual changes to your metabolism. But for antidepressants to work you need food to create the neurotransmitters that they work on.",False,False

I’m one day in and panicking that I will binge my way back to obesity. However, if it improves my mood enough to help me get off my lazy ass- I’ll burn more calories than if I sleep in a ball for 14 hours a day. At this point, I’m out of other options and I’m desperate for some sort of life again.",False,False
