If someone was talking about heavily restricting I would be very worried for them too despite the fact I also do this. However I would continue to do it as I always find a way to justify it to myself ('I'll be fine, I still feel ok, I need to do this, etc') but as it is pretty much a universally unhealthy thing I still have a negative reaction of worry when other people do it because you do not see the justification process they go through. And of course, the ability to rationalise something to yourself does not make that thing rational.   'Do as I say, not as I do'. ",False,False

I also unfollowed anyone who wasn’t either an artist/musician i liked or someone i personally knew, and flagged all influencer posts as “not interested” on my explore page. It took me about a year to post anything. It really helped my body image and self confidence tremendously and maybe suggesting something similar to her might help her out?",False,False

I’m so conscious of how she seems to be very attentive of her appearance (deletes insta pics if they don’t get enough likes, I think she’s been facetuning some) and I wanna tell her she’s perfect regardless of how she looks, but I feel like a hypocrite saying that while starving myself ",False,False
