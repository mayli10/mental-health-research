Itâ€™s been hard to accept that recovery is a process because Iâ€™d love to have an actual visible path to a healthier relationship with food.   I really do wish I could stop struggling so much with my emotions, but thank you for all the kind words. Iâ€™m doing my best to minimize the negative feelings and behaviors.   Thank you again for the encouragement- it perked me up a bit",False,True

Maybe your therapist is trying to make sure you don't value weight loss so much that you slip into a restrictive ED instead and is wanting you to look at non appearance related goals and positives. Having said that you can't help to feel sad, emotions don't just stop. You're not an attention whore, everyone needs and deserves encouragement at least sometimes. I really hope you feel a lil better soon. ðŸ’›",False,False
