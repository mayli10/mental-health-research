I am too an Inverted Triangle Body Shape, trust me I dislike it so so so so so so much... D:  Lately, I look in the mirror and I just see a square and I can't change that, unfortunately...  I don't have huge cleavage which I wish I had...to feel more feminine.   So I guess trying to change the way we see ourselves \[its hard achieving this, but not impossible\] will make it easier.",False,False
