I usually eat whatever, even though I hate myself afterwards, but for the most part I don't give a shit anymore. I hate my body a lot, more than I ever have in the past, and I'm still always comparing myself to others, and I have no idea how people perceive me. Like you said, behaviors are pretty much gone, but I'm still plagued by the thoughts. I kinda miss the days I could eat 1000 calories over the course of a week.",False,False
