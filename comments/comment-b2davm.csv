(weird example but- have you seen The Magic School Bus? it's a sciency-kids-show thing and it explains it really well) ",False,False

(As a very very general rule of thumb more muscle means higher metabolism) for people dieting this means that they will probably not loose a lot of weight, as any loose in calories is compensated by their lower metabolism, but there is also a limit to how much your body can slow down before it dies. So you can still loose weight while in starvation mode, it just is harder then when you weren’t in starvation mode",False,False

Starvation mode is definitely a physiological process that exists. Message me if you have any questions. ,False,False

Metabolisms drop as your weight drops - smaller bodies need less fuel. Which means the more weight you lose, the less calories you’ll have to eat to continue losing weight at the same pace. I think a lot of people think they’re in starvation mode because they aren’t losing weight as quickly as they were when they started, but in reality they just haven’t accounted for their lower metabolism.  Your metabolism also slows some with restriction, but it’s not permanent. As soon as you start eating more it goes back up - If I eat over my usual maintenance my HR goes up, i get really warm, and end up burning 200-300 more calories than usual with no extra exercise",False,False

If you have excess fat/muscle, it doesn’t make that much sense to me. However, at my LW (1000cal restriction and daily running) I lost a lot of muscle and my metabolism definitely slowed. I don’t think it’s a “mode” your body enters, I think it’s just the body using muscle for fuel first, therefore decreasing your metabolic rate, and you get skinnyfat.",False,False

I can only speak from experience and what I’ve read/watched online on the topic. I think the term “starvation mode” is a lil sensationalist and people tend to talk about the body clinging to fat in a hyperbolic way sometimes, but I do believe that metabolic adaptation is a real thing, and it can be a stronger response in certain people than in others. it seems like for some folks who restrict/overexercise for an extended period of time, their TDEE will drop. one common reason for those with an ED is lean muscle loss (you can mitigate this somewhat by doing weight training and getting enough protein). another reason is you’ll just naturally be more sedentary/less fidgety if you’re consuming little food. the part which seems to be hazy and more often debated is the other ways in which the body might downregulate metabolic processes to lower your BMR.. I’m struggling to make sense of it, too. but I’ve watched my weight stay the same or climb the past 2.5 months below what “should” be my sedentary TDEE. it’s incredibly frustrating and saddening and confusing, and the only thing that might remotely explain it when I’m researching is the concept of metabolic adaption. I didn’t even restrict for that long, and I had frequent refeed/maintenance days, but I think I messed up my hormones to an extreme degree with poor sleep and stress which probably contributed to it. I’m sorry I can’t give a clear/satisfying answer, just my anecdote - but if you’re interested in hearing someone explain the topic much more clearly, both Paul Revelia and Layne Norton have good videos on a YouTube. you can also find people on the other side of the argument on YouTube, too, but from everyone I’ve read/listened to, their takes seem the most consistent with my experience.",False,False
