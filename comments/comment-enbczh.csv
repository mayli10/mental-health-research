In the US it is equal to 8 fluid oz (different from weight oz, yay units). To measure with a cup, it should be a measuring cup - a cup of known volume (they sell ‚Äòem). Milk density I think will be close to water density, so you could calculate the mass of a serving in grams and weigh it out too, if you have a kitchen scale.   At least in the US, I‚Äôm pretty sure you can buy dairy milk from cows *not* treated with bovine growth hormone, rBST. (It will be indicated on the carton.)",False,False
