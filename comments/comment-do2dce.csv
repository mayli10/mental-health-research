Resultantly if someone and their ‘circle’ of friends caredabout/enjoyed trends &amp; fads then i could see why they think of it as humoring— not quirky or relatable though lol.  I suspect both entertainment media &amp; social media trends are the main reasons behind that.  A couple years ago I feel like every couple months there was some prepackaged “detox-cleanser” smoothie thing that was being promoted on social media. Usually it was promoted as a short term fad diet thingy either explicitly or implied.    I don’t keep up with celebrities that much these days but it seems like every few months there’s some fad diet (new or old) that gets popularized by being attached to some celeb.   Going way back to 2006 or around that time Beyoncé did that 2 week Lemonade diet (“Master Cleanse”) to help her slim down quickly for dream girls. It didn’t really matter that it was known that people gained the water weight back after the diet ended—it was now “cool” to do.    In the early twentytens both Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston (*apparently they had same trainer*) did that weird 1000kcal baby food diet for all. Taylor swift did that chia seed one a few years ago, pretty sure this one my colleague tried out lol. And there was that one where Kendall Jenner low key promoted drinking over a dozen cups of ~~laxative~~ DETOX tea per day.   Yeah they’re short term, stupid, and pointless    Even the unhealthy ones ont really",False,False
