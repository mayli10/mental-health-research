It really is all in our heads.. this is were my therapist works with me to “let go” of the obsessive parts that are “lying” to me and to try and use logic instead.   The emotional part won’t go away.. but she kinda tells me to put that part.. the unreliable part in the background.. and to try and focus on the logical part... she always says to “bring it forward in my brain” if I can.  It’s weird.. lol she does it better than I can!,False,False
