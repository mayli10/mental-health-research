This sounds like something id do. ""I actually feel good today, im gonna wear something cute"" until someone makes a comment &amp; i feel XXTRA conscious about the way i look and binge. Especially when its your mom and you're literally just in your own house.   I will say i see your point about her description of herself (ideal body in tight clothes) and agree that imagery is maybe a lil too romantic and could be damaging for people on this sub. But on the other hand im still a lil uncomfortable that were judging her for saying shes wearing a croptop and she has a nice body. Like if she said ""im slim, have big boobs, big ass, was wearing a turtleneck, and my mom called me skinny"" would that make her a more sympathetic character? The fact that she was showing skin doesnt take away from the fact that her mom straight up asked her ""have u been throwing up again"" in front of her WHOLE family, and thats fuuucked up.",False,False

I think OP like many of us is deep down insecure about appearance / looks, and maybe the way they described their body is a way to feel better about themselves. To each their own.",False,False

I just see this as ‚Äúpeople think I look skinny in my crop top!‚Äù Like... ok? Woe is you?   And the unnecessary description of her outfits so we can imagine her ~ideal body~ in tight-fitting clothing is also a little too üÜóüÜí for me but maybe I‚Äôm just too old to be on this sub lmao",False,False

This is an ed sub. Even if you were joking. Like i get where you're coming from, but even when we logically ""know"" we have nice bodies, we can't always see it or think so ourselves.   Op cried and is obviously upset so i don't think this comment is super constructive.",False,False
