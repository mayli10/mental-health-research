Honestly: yes, those are more meal-ish (particularly the waffle one). A snack is an apple. I agree with others that you have to overcompensate.. double size ""snack"" now after lots of snacks of size zero.   if you have a good sense of humour, tell yourself ""I'm recovering so I can eat less"" ",False,False
