I always had a hard time fitting in due to autism so I threw myself into school and dieting with no life whatsoever. I dieted extremely no matter how odd I’d look in front of other people to the point where I didn’t menstruate for 2.5 years. I was focused on being perfect in those ways and it did get me far in some ways - started college at 15 and finished my bachelors at 20 years old for it. But I have almost none of the memorable teenage experiences many of my friends now have and it makes me bummed out sometimes.,False,False

She asked me so many questions about what I was going through and reassured me that she would do anything she could to help. I am loved and I deserve to be loved.,False,False

Funnily enough, any time my mum sees me starting to go off the rails (as it were), she will always reach out to me and ask me not to isolate myself. Tells me I don’t need to deal with things alone if I don’t want to. Eventually people understand what your coping mechanisms are, and they create a space for you for when you’re ready. They do miss and love you.",False,False

Someone cut me out of their life 7 months ago and hasn’t thought of me since. I miss them everyday but I’d be delusional to think they still cared.,False,False

I'm saving this to look at it later. Hell, I might even print it out and put it above my desk.  The way you wrote this really spoke to me. So thank you for that :)",False,False
