I cook for people constantly and have all my friends and family over and make huge feasts and never eat any of it. I feel like I get my fill vicariously through them and plus I think I am a person who likes to show love through my hospitality and feeding people. I love cooking and I love trying new things and seeing everyone enjoy them.,False,False

And yes toddlers are supposed to have baby fat but a ""slight tummy"" could mean healthy baby fat or it could mean she is well on her way to being overweight later in life. Ideally, todders shouldn't be eating candy/refined sugars at all, or maybe only like once per week as a special treat. Definitely not every day! Please don't spread your unhealthy habits to an innocent young child.",False,False

(p.s. she was quite shy towards me at first and me giving her food actually helped her understand i was a friend. and from then on she calls me her “best friend”)",False,True
