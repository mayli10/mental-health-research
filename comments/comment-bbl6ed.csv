He knows Iâ€™m not eating much, but I think it helps put him at ease to see me put at least one thing in my face when heâ€™s around. You could also potentially have a talk with him about how getting on you about it could have an adverse effect on your relationship with food, even if itâ€™s well meaning. Eating disorders are fickle beasts, and I know that when someone is trying to be helpful, or point out that my train of thought regarding my intake is unhealthy, it tends to send me into overdrive for whatever reason. Maybe coming to an agreement on your eating habits would help soothe the living situation and your dadâ€™s concerns.",False,False
