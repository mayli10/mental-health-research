This lady in a red bra weeping on the floor? Seen it. These parents putting a padlock on the  fridge? Seen it. These twins making the exact same gestures so one doesn't burn more calories than the other? Seen it, seen it, SEEN. IT.  Will keep seeing it though!",False,False

There's an Instagram rabbit hole to fall down and it's full of # tunnels I keep discovering. YouTube has ED/Ana recovery docs but I know I watch them to trigger myself. I Google specific tiny celebs and look at their pictures or watch their films.   Basically this shit takes up tiiiiiime if I let it.   It never works though. It just makes me sad and annoyed, feeling worthless and like I have no self control. I try really hard to avoid it all now - it's like an addiction and it's so easy to do from my phone - but it's never ever a good idea.   I hope you can muster the strength to do things for yourself that make you feel good instead of things that trigger unhappy or unhelpful thoughts.",False,False

When I'm not doing great but not too badly I watch a lot of videos of people eating on youtube.,False,False
