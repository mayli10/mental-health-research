I felt worse when I came down, because at the end of the day, it's all just a facade, the feeling good. It's not real. I'd recommend slowly decreasing your usage before quiting entirely. Drug addiction is a hell-pit I wouldn't wish on anyone.",False,False

For about two years, I used benzos to eat and uppers to suppress my appetite (as well as weed for self medication for a long time before that). Honestly, I can't tell you how easily my ED transformed into a drug addiction of equal or greater severity. If I have any advice for you, it'd be to stop using before it starts becoming a bigger interference in your life, but that's obviously much easier said than done and I understand that. Like the top comment said, professional help in some capacity is \*really\* helpful! Do things that \*you\* find stress relieving, do things that favor sobriety, etc. I understand how drug use can be a much-needed respite from yourself, but there are other ways to achieve that. They might not be as easy or as perfect, but they're a lot less detrimental to your mind and/or body, and my drug use really worsened both my ED and my other mental health issues.",False,False

I started using them for appetite suppression at first, but then I realized that they liberated me from my ED and I became heavily dependent on them for many years. Sometimes they can really help with ED symptoms but often they can worsen them and obviously they carry their own risks and having co-morbid ED and substance use increases the risks of both.  I would suggest working on one at a time. Imo drugs is easier and more straightforward (coke, opiates, benzos, you name it. Walk in the park compared to AN!) so maybe detox first and then once you’ve got that in check tackle the ED.   It’s tough without professional help but possible, though you may want to start with some psychotherapy or CBT at first to give you some tools for coping. Good luck!",False,False
