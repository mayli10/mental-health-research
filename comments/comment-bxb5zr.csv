I finally got weighed at my doctor's office yesterday because I wasn't sure if my dad's old floor scale was still accurate and it turned out I did gain the weight. I noticed that when I haven't eaten enough it's not a big deal, so I can just usually have something small instead of having to eat a full meal and then getting sick from it. I guess I've accepted it and don't care to lose weight again.",False,True
