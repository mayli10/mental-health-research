If someone is downstairs they will definitely see what I'm getting out of the fridge. You'd have to be pretty oblivious to not notice. I just want to eat my single string cheese or half cup of cottage cheese for dinner in peace lol",False,True

I always ate in my room anyways why would a roommate pay attention to that ?_?,False,False
