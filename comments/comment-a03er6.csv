I do the powdered cacao flavor blended in my Vitamix. Lately I have been adding PBFit for a little flavor variety but usually I drink it plain mixed with water. I restrict less if I drink my calories because I hate feeling the fullness that accompanies solid food. ,False,False

I loathe banana flavored anything, and banana plenny shake to me tasted like banana laffy taffy. If you love banana stuff I’d recommend it, but I stick to vanilla, chocolate, and neutral!",False,False

I spent $10 a week on groceries in college until I got on food stamps. I did buy Plenny Shake once during college as a splurge and way to manage the holidays with family, and it was worth it to me.

I don't use it as much since relapsing because my parents feed me most of the time and that meal is normally big enough that I tend to fast most of the other day but I did before a lotttt because I could eat it with no prep and it wouldnt trigger any binging. also my ADHD meds mean I have no appetite for part of the day and it's the only thing I can really make myself eat   once I live on my own I plan on using it even more than I do now since I'm lazy and there won't be any family making food. Otherwise I binge on lots of junk which is not healthy. Most of my friends thing it's nasty but honestly I could live on just Soylent and be totally fine so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,False,False
