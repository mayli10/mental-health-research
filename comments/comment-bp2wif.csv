People with bulimia are at a high risk of dying because you can immediately die from a heart attack due to electrolyte imbalances or a ruptured esophagus or stomach. I've been in residential for bulimia, and I didn't gain 50 pounds a week. Without disclosing too much, I actually was on an intense meal plan because they couldn't keep my weight from dropping after I stopped purging.",False,False

As far as I know, yes, if you're under 18 (or 17, whichever the legal emancipation age is in your state), you can be forced to go to treatment. You really don't have the legal decision to decide what treatment you do and don't get, your parents do.   &amp;#x200B;  Btw, you can be malnourished and still shit every day. You're likely suffering from a lot of vitamin deficiencies because lots of common binge food isnt healthy. And no, they make sure you gain weight (if you even need to) at a steady pace. EDs are mean and make you think everyone who cares about you is out to make you fat.",False,False

Though you may not think your malnourished you might have body dysmorphia, seeing your body in a deluded skewed way, compared to how everyone else sees you. As a fellow sufferer of bulimia, it is very easy to get not enough nutrients in your diet. Residential may be a good idea. Though you might be a “healthy weight” your body is not healthy, and at a residential program they can teach you to think differently about food.  i hope everything turns out okay, xoxo",False,False
