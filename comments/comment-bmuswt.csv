I’ve seen a more-than-usual number of posts and comments on here recently about people being mad at their bone structure or other things they can’t change with weight loss because it means they’ll never be “perfect”. I’ve been struggling with how my rib cage seems massive to me all of a sudden.   I guess I just like that it’s not a photo of her on shoot day vs a photo of her after eating a pizza. Those are good reality checks too (everyone bloats after eating, it’s not just you, it doesn’t mean you’re fat, etc), but I think we on this sub in particular need reminders that even if we’re fasting or restricting, it’s totally normal that our bodies don’t look flat or concave every second of the day.",False,False
