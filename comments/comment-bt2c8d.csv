Unless someone's got a disease like diabetes or kidney disease where they need to limit certain foods or their calorie intake, it just doesn't make sense why anyone else would do that.",False,False

Just saying though, coffee and water is all I consume during fasts and when i'm restricting i do the slow chew too. I think ed's are more about mindset and how far you take it though. A neurotypical person trying to lose weight will stop when they reach a goal weight (and that gw ususally falls within a healthy bmi range) a disordered person will just keep pushing their limits and seeing how far they can take it.",False,False

I'm a fan of balance and moderation. The diets you mentioned are definitely disordered and not rooted in science.,False,False

I think that interference and distress are the key distinctions.  Even if someone is in denial, if they’re spending more than X amount of time per day for at least Y amount of days/weeks/months worrying about weight or food or getting enough exercise or feel guilty about their food, then they probably have an eating disorder.  Acknowledging or understanding that you have a mental disorder is not a requirement.   On the other hand, I think most people experience some dissatisfaction about their weight and attempt to diet at some point. Non-disordered people can go on extreme diets for short periods of time, but when the diet starts to interfere with their lives, they make concessions to the diet. They don’t wrap their entire lives around trying to adhere to rigid diets.",False,False
