Eating disorders are mental illnesses with physical effects being byproducts. You are doing a very low restrictive intake in order to manipulate your body and that is essentially the definition of an eating disorder. I knew people in residential who had overweight BMIs with devastating restrictive eating disorders that lead to the same health complications as people who were underweight. Eating disorders do not discriminate: they effect people of all body types.,False,False
