You *can* dehydrate an orange, for example, for a truer estimate of the actual ""fruit"" content of the orange, but it's also sort of disingenuous. An orange naturally *should* contain a lot of water, so it feels inaccurate to say the weight of a dehydrated orange is the true weight because that's not how they're meant to exist.    People can lose their water weight, but it serves a lot of important functions in our bodies and our natural state is to retain it. If you want your ""meat"" weight, then yeah the dehydrated state is more accurate. But if you want YOUR weight, then water weight (and the range that another commenter mentioned) should be included.    ...of course this bitch here still 100% does her weigh ins first thing in the morning after peeing, because it's not a true ED unless you lie to yourself! (/s obviously because everyone is valid)",False,False
