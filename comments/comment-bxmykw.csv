However this is how I look at it and it might help you too! When I get a comment like “you look so healthy!” Like the rest of us we know they mean well but what we think they’re saying is “you’ve gotten so fat”. I think back to the times I’ve been looking at recovery pages and how glad I am to see how healthy some of these people look and I wish that I could tell them that even though I never would knowing how it feels. But when I think it it comes from a place of thinking they look better and stronger and not thinking they’ve gotten fat. So I think why can’t that apply when people say it to me?,False,False
