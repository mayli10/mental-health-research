I was never overweight. Ive never been overweight. But I was the tallest in the class. Teachers used to comment on how 'big' I was.   I developed disordered eating but I always stayed healthy. I started to grow prettier. My weight was a constant discussion for people.   Then I got engaged at 23. We broke up when I was 24. I had to work 2 jobs to survive. I lost 5kg without thinking about it. Cue the compliments.  I continued to do it.,False,False
