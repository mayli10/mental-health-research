The *actually skeletal* state she was allowed to get into... her family *had* to want that.    If (to them) Eugenia was so clearly being conditioned, and kept under lock and key (or in this case, gigantic fucking door bars), is it so ""disgusting"" her friends would intervene? I agree with you against forced treatment with regard to personal freedom and bodily autonomy (as well as the fact that fucking *no-one* ever gets better in a recovery they don't choose), but Eugenia clearly wasn't being kept in an environment where she had *any* choice, let alone choosing to go to IP.      Would it be any better to you if they had instead watched her die?   Questions about 'the extent of freedom' are always impossible to settle on the nature of what 'freedom' implies; we don't want to condone or be complicit in *terrible* things, but we also want to allow people to fundamentally make all their own decisions. Hence debates about free speech, abortion rights, euthanasia etc. all persist. Each topic is a struggle against morality and every position can always be debated with a conflicting one. It's impossible to say exactly what is ""right"" in this Eugenia situation, because it depends on what you value.",False,False

She is in a tough spot, having the internet so focused on her weight for so long and now her recovery. I think Shane offering to help her get back to YouTube makes sense instead of her coming back alone, considering all the backlash she’s gotten for years.

Idk, she’s got every right to not talk about it, being public and in recovery would be incredibly difficult, and it seems like people had been talking about her weight on the internet for years now, that’s a lot to face. But I thought she just really stood out as being somewhat in denial or at least not wanting to be 100% open, not that I think she should’ve been, but she didn’t need to say she was ready to talk either.

Hearing Jaclyn’s side of the story helps in having a better understanding of what’s been going on, but it’s Eugenia’s life and her business.
