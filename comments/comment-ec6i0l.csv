When i was waking a CNA course we had weights as a measurement skill. I remember the 3x i was weighed in front of people and that made me restrict even more. I almost stabbed someone when they weighed me and were like ""OMG U WEIGH XXX LBS???"" out loud. Also the other 2 weren't too bad but it was a test skill for my partner so i sucked it up for her bc i liked her. Afterwards she asked me if I really weighed xxx lbs and i was like yep lmao. In my mind i was like oh it's bc she thinks I'm so fat there's no way, but I know it was only bc she hoped she would be close enough to get points for her skill. But yeah didn't eat much after that",False,False

Yes, owning a scale and weighing yourself every day (a disorder behavior) would be detrimental to your recovery, and would likely cause an immediate, full-blown relapse. Your recovery, your health, your safety, your sanity, and your joy are so infinitely more important than obsessing over your weight. Youâ€™re stronger than this! ðŸ’•",False,False
