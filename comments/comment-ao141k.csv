I wanted to explain to the nurse that I've been stress bingeing and I'm bloated af not to mention that I'm pms-ing plus I was wearing my heavy sweatshirt!!!

Welp thanks to this sub for letting me vent into the void. TIA to anyone who can relate.  I'm cutting out sugar - my cravings and mood swings have been through the roof lately - and going back to strict OMAD. It isn't even 100% about my weight, just how much *better* I feel when I eat lighter. I'm getting back to that, there's no other option. It just also sucks because a month ago I was doing really well and losing weight but more importantly eating overall healthier and feeling better and more confident. Then I had one bad weekend and it completely threw me into binge/restrict and I've been spiraling into deep depression since then. I finally cleaned my apt last night/this morning and took out the trash (after the bag ripped so I spent way too long cleaning up gross moldy shit and popcorn kernels rip) and painted my toenails and I'm going to prioritize self care again.   I'm trying to tell myself that part of this is just major bloat/waste because even post-Christmas I haven't seen a number this high in literal months and I can't have gained it all in a cumulative two weeks of overeating and my clothes still fit even if they're a little less comfortable.

Don't know how or why it happened, but it did. I was doing so well. I got an increase in Vyvanse three days ago. Perhaps it's because I hadn't binged in a week, and I'm not accustomed to going long without bingeing.  But I hit a breaking point this morning. I usually punish myself for bingeing somehow, even if it's simply mentally berating myself for 2 days afterward, but my therapist was right last night; as the famous quote goes, doing the same thing and expecting change is insanity.  I'm almost at my first goal weight. The goal weight I set when I was 16. Of course, I've lowered it now, but even after I lowered it, I thought once I reached 119 pounds, or was very close to, I would be thin and close enough to my UGW that I wouldn't binge anymore and just focus on reaching my UGW. Well, obviously after last night, I realize that isn't the case.  I've lost almost 40 pounds, and when I look in the mirror, I still see that 158 pound girl I used to be in the mirror.  I went to my plastic surgeon yesterday. I'm getting a breast reduction done in June. The last I saw him, I was 141 pounds in August, and he was all board on me losing more weight. When he saw me yesterday, and I told him I wanted to lose more weight before the surgery, he was hesitant. He said he was okay with it because I had lost 20 pounds over the six months gradually and thought I was healthy, but little did he know that after I saw him last, I got up to 147, started purging again for a bit, mostly quit purging but basically lost most of this weight in a couple months.  He was okay with me saying that I just wanted to lose a little bit more until I hit 110 because I explained to him that I wouldn't be underweight until 100 pounds. But I don't know. This guy's whole career is built upon beauty, and his face basically read what his nurse said which was, ""This looks like a really good weight for you.""  I dunno. I still want to lose more weight, especially because I've been overweight most of my life and this whole normal weight thing is a new thing for me. My UGW was 99 pounds. But in my head, I'm still this fat monster. I thought I would be cured if I lost the weight, but now that I've almost fully lost it, I'm still not cured of BED.  I still want to keep dropping weight, but I guess I'm just going to eat 3 healthy meals today, with glorious amounts of food. If I exercise today, I'm going to exercise because I want to move my body and feel good, not because I'm trying to work off these binge Calories. I'm still going to lose a bit more, but perhaps I'm just gonna be 107 pounds for my surgery instead of 103 (I'm scared he won't give me it if he knows I have BDD). I'm just going to forgive myself for this binge, keep going, and keep trying to recover rather than punish myself for this.",False,False

While shopping, I got fewer things than I wanted because I know I realistically can't eat as much as I think I can. The damage was maybe ~3000 cals, no more for sure. I stopped when I felt too full; I didn't go over the edge towards 'won't be able sleep' territory.  I pounded the water throughout the night, about 3 liters. I get up to drink often and go through a liter on a normal night. I woke up feeling okay. Honestly, it'll be heaven when I finally poop.
