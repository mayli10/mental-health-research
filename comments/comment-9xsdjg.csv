Ive seen some harmful encouragement but also a lot more positive encouragement there. Sadly mods have final say even if we have a good case ,False,False

But to your point, if someone encourages behavior that harms themselves or others (whether egging them on to restrict on an ED support subreddit or encouraging violence/harassment in any political subreddit) the comment should be removed, user warned, banned if repeatedly violated, and usually a sub is banned when mods are uncompliant. I may be wrong, but I believe that is standard.    Considering how active the mods were at proED, I'm skeptical it was uncompliance, or really even unsafe, just advertiser-unfriendly.    That said, when it comes down to it, Reddit admins don't actually have to be fair. It sucks, but it is their website and they can legally remove any content and subs they want, I suppose I wish they were just honest as to why.",False,True

ProED, to me, was 100% supportive and a community that I really needed. I loved how unfiltered it was and how it *didn‚Äôt* glamourise eating disorders. I‚Äôm so disappointed and sad that it‚Äôs gone.   However, I‚Äôm not angry at the Reddit Admins because I can totally see why it looked so terrible and harmful to them.   Certain aspects of the sub, like having your weight stats on display, thinspo, the daily food diary sticky and referring to being underweight as progress *are* big parts of the disease and need to be talked about, but people who have never experienced an ED can‚Äôt understand that.
