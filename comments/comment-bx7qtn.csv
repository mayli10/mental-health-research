Like I said they seem a lot more clear now!   That’s insane - I get a cheat day (I mean personally it’s never worked and just eating a balanced diet has worked so much better) but that many calories of food is just a binge! Insane! I’ll have to check her out - it sounds like her denial is pretty intense &gt;.&gt; thanks for sharing the info,False,False

Stephanie Buttermore is her name (on YT as well), she had a history of cheat day videos up to 10k calories and documented for viewers her quick drop in weight in the days after, but is now admitting changes need to be made because of her appetite currently being out of the control, for someone that always made it look so easy and effortless to eat so much (I for sure watched videos while in binge urge mode) this is pretty awesome to see.",False,True

I wasn’t trying to get anything specific out of this! A seemingly interesting post appeared on my home page, so I clicked and engaged. :)  I was trying to respond to your original post and your response to my comment - neither of which was clear and your comment didn’t make sense. I don’t know if it’s a typo, grammatical error, language barrier,  etc but what you said didn’t make sense.",False,False

I was saying that restricting to a low weight while trying to ignore increased appetite + need for cheat days may be something she doesn’t feel was disordered want to acknowledge as having been disordered but that her mode of addressing the issue is pretty brave and similar to ed recovery.,False,True
