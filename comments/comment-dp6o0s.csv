Woke up at 6:30... what the actual fuck.. craving chocolate, since I screwed up yesterday my mind has the mentality ""well, you screwed up, now it doesn't matter what you do."" But it does. I want to prove myself and my mind wrong. So instead of having any chocolate I am having a chocolate raspberry drink. Today might be tough as I am watching my nieces and my SAD is acting up. Might go out later and get Vitamin D pills. I plan to go to WalMart this morning.",False,True

I had a sugar filled chocolate Belgian waffle from Aldi's about 9:50. Nearly 300 calories for one waffle. Now drinking water and french vanilla hot drink. Feeling bit disappointed. I slept bad, had nightmares, had a bloody nose, woke up at 6am to my nieces being loud so that upset me. My younger niece should be at daycare but is instead here. That's ok but unexpected.
