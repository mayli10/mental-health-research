Just maybe all my bad feelings wanna make me hurt myself. I say such negative things and just am like I don't deserve to be happy or skinny or feel good.   Almost like I'm punishing myself.   My husband is awful about pushing food on me. Not blaming him. I make the choice but it's harder. He is always tempting me with binge triggering foods and we got into a huge fight a few days before because he was trying to force me to eat. I don't feel his support.,False,True

I’m making a commitment to myself and my husband to stop this madness—it just triggers more binges and depression. I don’t like the person binging has turned me into.   Even if you hate yourself, know that you have my love❤️",False,False
