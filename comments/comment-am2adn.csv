As you lose weight, you have less mass, which requires less energy to keep alive (hence, your BMR lowers), but you can counter this by increasing muscle (which requires more energy to maintain....ie. burns more calories at rest) and/or moving more (ie. increasing NEAT).  3) Because part of your overall daily energy requirement (daily maintenance calories) is due to the fact that it takes calories to digest food (thermic effect of food), there is a slight uptick in calories burned when you eat more.  This is the ""logic"" behind cheat days/meals, but the amount that you burn is grossly overexagerrated, and cheat meals ARE NOT good for you.    So, how much can you affect your own metabolism?  If you build muscle and exercise and just overall move more and sit less, you can probably increase it by 500-700 cal a day, but its more common to increase by 200-300.    There's no possible way to permanently fuck up one's metabolism.  Period.  ",False,False

efjmv3s,t3_am2adn,t3_am2adn,titiparisienne,1,2019-02-01 14:21:20,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/am2adn/something_a_nurse_at_my_ed_center_said/efjmv3s/,"&gt;like a car that doesn't get any fuel    That's absurd.  Does your car magically get better gas mileage when you're running low?  Of course not!    Your mileage is higher in certain conditions (in your body's case, sedentary states) and lower in others (exercise).    If you're really running on fumes, you might choose to shut off your car when you're stuck in traffic rather than waste fuel by idling.  Likewise, your body may start to reduce your NEAT, or non-exercise activity thermogenesis, in order to burn fewer calories and get better ""mileage.""  This could mean that you subconsciously fidget less that usual, or otherwise stop ""wasting"" (according to your body) precious energy.    It does NOT mean that your body magically uses less for what it does do.  You're still getting the same MPGâ€“it takes the same amount of energy to heat your body, to walk around, etc.    Now as you lose weight, your energy expenditure DOES go down.  It still takes the same amount of energy per unit of mass to heat your body, move around, etc. but there's less of you to heat/move/etc.  It has nothing to do with ""metabolic damage"" or ""starvation mode"" or whatever.",False,False

There's a limit to all of this though, it's not possible for the body to just stop burning calories. Heavily restricting or fasting you'll burn maybe 400 calories less daily than a person with the same height, weight and body composition as you. Most of the metabolic slowdown immediately disappears when calories are raised. ",False,False
