There's one in particular that he staunchly defends if I say she photoshops... Yet he still insists on showing her to me - like he's trying to convince me otherwise? lol. Anyway, I really don't care if he looks at porn and a lot of the thinspo I look at I'll share with him etc. But this one fucking model he is so into and the reason I feel so threatened or bad (aside from just generally feeling shit about myself and my body) is that she clearly has massively fake tits and a ton of other plastic surgery AND the Photoshop. So I asked him if he'd want me to be more plastic because clearly he likes it... His response: No, you're perfect. Obviously she is gorgeous but only temporarily as the plastic surgery will look awful when she's older... I don't know why that would make you feel bad. Really? K.  As I write this I'm beginning to forget my point but I guess I understand how you feel and maybe it doesn't make sense but as long as he's not trying to get you to change to be like that then maybe try to look past his superficial feelings for them. Also might be a good idea to bluntly tell him how it makes you feel. I'm here if you ever want or need to talk or vent or whatever.",False,False

Girl... run for the hills! The last thing any of us need is someone willing to enable our bullshit tbqh. I used to be grateful when guys thought me eating like a bird was cute or feminine. Now it pisses me the fuck off because I realized they don't care if I'm healthy or not. I'm not going to live my life according to some dude's fucking tiny girl fetish. We may have those evil voices in our heads, but it doesn't mean we have to accept the real life voices too. I wish you the best x",False,False

Like telling me to eat less (when I already eat very little and am dizzy all the time, which he is aware of) or to exercise more often. He also “jokingly” calls me thicc or a big girl which always just feels more hurtful than funny to me.",False,True

My ‘type’ is tall, dark skinned women (preferably with a thick, exotic accent) in business suits. I also have a bit of a thing for some skinny Asian looking ladies.  My fiancée, however, is a very short, very white little lady with a decidedly London accent. Long story short, she isn’t my ‘type’ but she’s my fiancée. I love her more than any swanky editorial dream.   She hilarious, she’s caring, she’s kind. She makes me feel safe.  I want to spend the rest of my life with her. No amount of melanin, tiny titties or fitted suits will convince me otherwise.  Most women I know think Magic Mike types are the shit, but their husbands’ have dadbods.   TLDR; People love people for being people, not their parts for looking pretty.  HOWEVER   I’m a tad worried about your ‘he still doesn’t think I’m skinny’ comment. Is this something he has said to you or something you feel he thinks?",False,False
