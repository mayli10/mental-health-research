All of it.  Mukbangs are hit and miss for me. Some days it inspires me to eat more, some days it feels like restricting  And the biggest one? Alcohol. Even a glass of wine, for some reason, sky rockets my appetite and makes me lose control.  I don't worry about the last one for now, since I'm on medication that banned me from drinking... Yay?

If I binged on it once, I will binge on it every time until I actively stop buying it and unlearn the habit.  2.being tired. It’s the same feeling as being stoned, and since I have no self control when I’m stoned my brain seems to think being tired is a good excuse to binge. I was heavy into sleeping pills and while it was a whole mess in many aspects, bingeing was what made me finally stop. I even sleep-ate when I was barely awake enough to stand up.   3.Boredom. It’s easy to low restrict when I’m at work or busy, but on days where I’m just at home with nothing to do, it’s so hard to not just eat the entire day.  4.Anxiety. When I’m really stressed out and scared I binge and binge and binge.   5.breakfast in bed. Nothing good ever comes out of this. ",False,False

One of mine is seeing carbs like bread or pasta. If I see it I just want to eat all of it all at the same time until I throw up. Also fries??? I’m so afraid of them because they’re soo calorie dense and I know if I eat even one I’ll spiral so it’s best to not even look at them. ,False,False

I was trying to make cookies for a roommate and everything just went terribly out of control. It was bad. Like nothing was working, shoving cookie dough in my mouth while frustratedly crying and throwing cookie cutters bad. And then the whole day was just a disappointment conga line of self sabotage. So I ate continuously, hated myself, and hid any evidence of binging and my roommate came home to a lovingly-displayed plate of substandard Plan C cookies none-the-wiser. I mean the day was so fucking terrible that I'll take the win of actually having cookies left to present. ",False,False

Frustration on body progress. The overwhelming frustration on feeling so damn hungry all the time. The frustration of restriction. The frustration of always thinking about food. I suppose it's a form of emotional eating, but it's more self sabotage than anything. I definitely have an all or nothing mentality. ",False,False

Usually I can try not to binge when I’m in those moods, but then I get into a “black or white” mindset where I go “well I’m already fat might as well” so it depends on where I am at that point.   Also mukbangs or recipe videos or blogs or anything that’s not “safe food”.   Oh and having big parties or gatherings or celebrations where I feel like food’s so expensive and I can’t let it go to waste, which then turns into a “I ate a lot already soooo might as well turn it into a cheat”",False,False

I also get very sad during these times. So...my own body? ,False,False
