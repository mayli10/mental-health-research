It said it takes a lot of mental willpower to hid parts of oneself from oneself so there is none left for self control. So I‚Äôve been doing an experiment on myself. Sometimes when I really feel out of control, I‚Äôve been asking myself, ‚ÄúWhat part of myself am I hiding?‚Äù I honestly don‚Äôt often get an answer. But several times the questioning had gotten me past the moment where I thought I‚Äôd lose my self control. ",False,False

I'd never really thought about it like that until I was talking about it with my then-kinda-boyfriend, who was, at the time, several months clean from shooting smack. I was talking about the cravings, the compulsively, the hollowness I have to fill with sweets, all the shame and secrecy, and how sometimes it's all I can think about and I feel like I'll never be ok if I don't eat, eat, eat, and he just said ""You're an addict, baby"" and it made so much sense to me.

On the one hand I have the familiar comfort of the old drug, restriction, and on the other I have the lively temptations of the new drug, ~~eating more than a small village eats in a week~~ binge-eating. The problem with the former drug is that it feels much too futile to use it now that I'm convinced that I'm the whaliest whale to over whale and the later comes with the added wrestle of trying not to break and purge on top of further progressing in my transition from human to blue whale.  So my (former?) disease is an addiction, recovering from it (which frankly feels faaaaaaaaaaar more 'diseased' to me what with all the binge-eating) has made me develop a new addition and all the time I'm haunted by the scepter of my addiction to purging.  Needless to say, I share your frustrations. It's unfathomable to me how people manage to eat normally. I've tried and I just fucking can't. Like you, I feel like my entire life is just one constant circlejerk about eating and avoiding food. I don't know if my life would have been better or worse if I actually did hard drugs.  My apologies for the self-centred rant, it's just that I'm fed up of this shit. If anyone finds this too negative, let me know and I'll delete this.     ",False,False

There are mechanisms you can learn to cope better with the desire to eat and make it less of a pain.

In the meantime, try to avoid your weakest foods (the ones you can't resist) and make sure that if you indulge into your cravings you don't blame yourself too much for it.

Remember that you are more than just an addict, and you are far stronger than your addiction.  It may not seem like it now, but all the little steps you are taking, no matter how insignificant they may seem, *are* helping you.  I've been using the daylio app for android for close to half a year.
