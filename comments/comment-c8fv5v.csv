I would see all the public groups do that, especially ones where they would, disgustingly, rate random women. I never participated, but I did see it often where they'd do what I mentioned.",False,False

I think people are naturally selfish and have a limited capacity for empathy. It can be overcome to an extent, but it takes a lot of work that realistically most people just aren't willing to exert.  Not to say I hate everyone; I have sympathy for everyone since existing is shit most of the time for most people. But that sympathy doesn't mean I'm unrealistically optimistic about humanity, myself included.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  And yeah, it is wild to me that people don't immediately think ""that person has deeper problems"" when seeing a morbidly obese person. Eating to cope with trauma or mental illness is probably a shared experience for a huge amount of people, especially in the US. It occurs to me just now that I feel super isolated in my bingeing problem usually, but there are likely so many other people (probably who I know personally) who go through the exact same thing.",False,False
