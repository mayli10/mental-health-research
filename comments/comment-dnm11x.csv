Slowly add calories in as you're hungry, it's scary but worth it.  I didn't trust my Fitbit either, got a heart rate one and I burn way more than I thought.",False,False

You may think you look fat because of bloating. Don’t worry it’s just temporary and stay strong,False,False

Please note that you should be eating considerably over that as BMR is basal metabolic rate so is essentially what you would burn if you were in bed and barely moving all day. As you almost certainly know, weight fluctuates. Therefore being at 91 is not high enough if 90 is emergency weight. A decent google should show you how to increase your weight. But please, please note that if you increase your uptake then your weight will be falsely high for a time. Basically your body will not be used to the amount of food you have took in (solid and water weight) and so it will prolly need some time to sort itself out so that your water weight stabilises and you aren’t constipated from increased intake. Good luck, wishing you the best",False,False

That's going to be a scary number for you, with how you're currently eating. Maybe work yourself up to it over a couple days, but don't take too long because you're very close to your mom's crisis point.  Also don't forget that upping your intake might cause some initial bloating, food and water weight, etc, and try not to panic.",False,False
