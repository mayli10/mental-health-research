My eating was disordered as a teen; in the past 6 months I realised ""shit, I have anorexia"". My family knows about my depression and they're a great support. I've heard them talk shit about eating disorders though like, ""don't be stupid just eat it's that easy!"" Most of my family suffer depression.  Depression is relatable. ED isn't.",False,False

In the last couple of months, a few (very young and thin) models have died of cardiac arrest. Which, okay, is pretty shocking and of course spurred speculation that it was caused by an eating disorder or drug use. And absolutely everybody responding to these 'accusations' was absolutely fucking livid that someone would dare insinuate that a poor innocent dead girl could have been engaging in something so horrific.  To be fair, it is generally insensitive and shitty to make a guessing game out of how someone died when their families haven't released any information and most likely want to mourn privately. But on the other hand, nobody would get offended at the implication that it was a congenital defect or some underlying physical illness that these people were dealing with. It might bother someone to speculate on a person's death at all, but it wouldn't be the nature of the speculation that was a problem unless you were claiming an ED or drugs might have been responsible. Y'all preach that addiction and anorexia are illnesses and not choices but yet when it's suggested that a person may be suffering from those illnesses it's an accusation and an attack on their character. So which is it?",False,False
