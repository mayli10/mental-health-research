I was exhausted and gaining weight and my mom has a thyroid problem. I made them test me and I ended up being fine thyroid wise but extremely iron deficient. Turns out I just needed iron and to eat healthier and not work 7 days a week.   I hope you are able to get an answer you’re looking for! I’m glad they finally gave you a test! ,False,False
