Even though I've shrunk enough to fit into size 00 jeans they're still so tight they make my thighs bulge out. It's fine though. I have new OtK socks now that aren't so tight at the top and look proper on me. I mean, sometimes they fall down a little, but that's the price to pay for wearing something that doesn't make me feel fat. It kind of sucks though that when my legs were bigger I was motivated by the idea that the old socks would look better on me if I lost weight.",False,False
