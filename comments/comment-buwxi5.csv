As many of us here are all to aware of, not eating enough isn't very fun and brings nothing but problems so MFP wouldnt want to encourage that.  Kinda like LoseIt! A few years ago wouldn't show you your predicted time to reach your goal if you didnt eat a certain amount in a day",False,False

Frustrating.  I don’t trust LoseIt’s intake estimates either because when last I dug into their math, the TDEE multiplier was ridiculous. So now I just do my own math. It’s inevitably an approximate number but at least this way I know how it was arrived at.",False,False
