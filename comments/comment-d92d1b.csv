Obviously, I would try to have a diet that permits sustainability (which requires some eating).. so maybe learn to restrict and when you DO eat, it can be around other people that way a) you don't start feeling guilty for eating if your ED gets too intense and b) so people don't start to think you're developing an ED. Maybe OMAD? Tell people that you eat earlier/later or have a certain diet so you can't eat the things they are.
