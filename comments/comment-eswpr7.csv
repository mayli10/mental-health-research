I'm having to apply for extenuating circumstances because the waiting list for my surgery is 18 weeks as its deemed non life threatening. Meanwhile over here I'm taking enough pain killers to knock out a horse. I can't focus or study and have 4 deadlines to meet in feb. I love the NHS and I know they're understaffed and I feel selfish for saying this but this problem that could be solved so quickly is just ruining my life currently and the feeling of helplessness is unbearable.  I really hope your appointment gets bumped or some cancellations happen so you can get seen sooner.  Maybe you could look into extensions for your course work or exams. Most universities are very accomodating, I really hope that there's someone you can talk to so you can get extra support in place if that's what you need.",False,False

Got told I'd be referred to a specialist but nothings happened yet. I'm sure my exams will pass before I get my diagnosis and meds, will probably have to try private but it's so expensive :(  I hope it gets bumped up for you and you get earlier availability!",False,False
