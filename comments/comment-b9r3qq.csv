I like to write meaningless side-characters as being important and cared for by the group of main characters. I typically have them in a supportive role, and I also put them through hell (stuff that I've delt with, but x10).     It helps to project my past and current painful experiences onto a character and have them cared for and loved. It's something I don't have in real life.",False,False

Donâ€™t have an ED myself, just taking a little wander in here, but I do have other mental health problems and a physical chronic illness. For years Iâ€™ve had a little world in my head where I take a character I relate to from whatever fictional world Iâ€™m into at the time, and I put them in the same situations Iâ€™m in and see what happens. Iâ€™ll take the character and give them my illness, imagine them going through what I do but at the same time having a good support system and dealing well with it.  Idk why we do this???",False,False

I have a really intense love for a silly little fictional character and thinking about him and painting him is definitely a BIG coping mechanism for me. I've created characters surrounding this preexisting character and honestly it makes me so happy just thinking about them. It's a super healthy coping mechanism because it's not damaging in any way to myself or to anyone else.   &amp;#x200B;  why do I love him? I just do. that's all that matters. ,False,False

It's not just you. I have a certain character from a certain series that I've built up a pretty complex backstory for, that runs rather parallel to my own mental health issues and past (I had a kinda traumatic childhood that I literally pretended was normal up until a few years ago, but I wrote about the trauma/being traumatized via this fictional character before I could admit to myself that it happened to me.) If I'm going thru an episode and need to vent my emotions, I""ll write about it. I do agree with you in that it makes it easier to sympathize-- it's easier for me to have empathy for my favorite character than it is for me to have empathy for myself sometimes.   My therapist seems to think it's a good coping mechanism so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯",False,False
