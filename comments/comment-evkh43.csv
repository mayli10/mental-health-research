Do you have heartburn or GERD? Anxiety? Your doc might recommend something OTC if it's gas or heartburn related, which is sometimes the case. If you haven't told them, just call and let a nurse know and ask for recommendations for how to care for yourself at home. They'll offer an appointment if needed, for a acid reflux med or antidepressant if you don't take one and you and they thought it might help if the chest pain could be from anxiety.   My labs &amp; EKG are normal, too. I have osteopenia in my hips, one leg and part of my spine, peroneoal &amp; peripheral neuropathy in one leg &amp; foot. I've had these since early last summer. They came within less than 6 months of relapse.",False,False

I have nearly died from purging and now I’m having chest pain. But all my blood work and EKG are fine. Maybe insurance would care more if I was showing more symptoms,False,True

It’s stupid that someone can see a dietitian if they’re getting bariatric surgery and a person with an eating disorder can’t. Where I live someone with diabetes can see a dietitian and eating disorders can’t. So if I needed bariatric surgery that type of eating disorder would be medically be considered medically deserving of seeing a dietitian, but AN-R with medical complications it’s not medically necessary according to my insurance. Does not make sense. And why does insurance cover bariatric surgery? That sounds like an elective procedure like plastic surgery. Ugh healthcare sucks!",False,False

Is your therapist willing to continue working with you?   Mine said I'm not making progress and that she wouldn't drop me because having no one would be even worse. My state's Medicaid wouldn't cover a dietitian. I tried an ED IOP last summer and they discharged me half way through what my insurance was willing to cover saying I wasn't making fast enough progress (despite no individual dietitian/meal planning being included, and not being able to get trauma therapy or bill for individual therapy at all while in IOP). I have a GI consult in 5 weeks, as I have digestive issues now. I had pancreatitis in November and have had to make major dietary changes to the point that I am not a candidate for any of the ED programs covered by my insurance. Oh well!",False,False

But if I do, I have to take leave, unpaid. I just can’t afford that. I have bills. The only way they would refer me is to a higher level of care. My dietitian said it basically wouldn’t be ethical to continue to work with me rather than referring me if I’m not making progress.",False,True

Please don't give up. You are much harder on yourself than anyone else would be. Treatment is so expensive and difficult to access. It makes it hard for those without private insurance, funds to travel to treatment/afford out of pocket costs.   You know yourself best. Try to keep working with your outpatient supports. Small steps forward and sometimes lapses. Recovery isn't linear or on a time table. If your team drops you, ask for referrals to other providers. Keep sharing in this community. Seek out in-person or online support groups if you think that would help increase your supports.",False,False
