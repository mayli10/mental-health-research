I also grew up in a house with two overweight parents constantly trying and failing fad diets who ingrained a lot of disordered behavior into growing adolescents. But I'm supposed to be denying that.",False,False

If you're worried about your family making a big deal of it, try this:  Serving yourself a big portion to meet their expectations but then not finishing it will draw attention. Instead, serve yourself as much as you can comfortably see yourself eating, and make sure you clear your plate.  To be clear, I'm not encouraging you to eat less - but serve an honest portion and finish it. It might get your family off your back a little and help you feel comfortable.  It's hard to count calories when you don't know everything that has gone into a food. I would encourage you to avoid trying to count - it will only stress you out to know your count is probably inaccurate. But if you do, just try to look for preset foods in whichever app you use and approximate the amount (if there's the options for cup measures, use those to approximate rather than trying to eyeball the weight).",False,False

Always thank them for offering you food.   Fake minor stomach aches or say your head hurts so you’d rather lay down but “might grab a bite to eat later”  When it comes to dinner join them, don’t take much. If they ask say something like the portions must be smaller at college or whatever. Some excuse as to why your not eating much all of a sudden. A good line is “oh I’ll save the rest of this for later as a snack” then ‘forget about it’ in the fridge. ",False,False
