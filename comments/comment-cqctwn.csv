I set my oven to 425 degree F, wash/peel/chop up a sweet potato into medium sized chunks. Toss in a tiny drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (you could skip this and use a spritz of Pam or something alternatively) and sea salt, and roast until it‚Äôs browned, tender, and delicious. Check on them every 15ish minutes and flip/rotate them as needed. After they‚Äôre roasted I sprinkle them with a little additional sea salt and some parsley, and eat as is or dipped in ketchup. So satisfying.",False,False
