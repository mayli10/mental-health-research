Itâ€™s honestly amazing how when you write out what youâ€™re feeling and put it out in the open, the urges seem kind of silly. Luckily I was able to fall asleep without binging and I feel so much better, I know I would be feeling extremely guilty right now otherwise. I actually slept through my doctors appointment because I was awake so late but honestly I donâ€™t even care if that means I didnâ€™t binge",False,True

I went through the same thing last night but I caved after a couple hours and it was NOT worth it. Hunger should just turn off after hitting maintenance ðŸ˜‘,False,False
