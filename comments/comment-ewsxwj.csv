I hope you can talk through this with him.  If you do have an arrhythmia though, you need to know. And maybe they won't take you because of it, but if they won't take you if you don't take the test anyway, there's nothing to lose by taking it.   If you take the test and don't have an arrhythmia, sweet. If you take the test and do have one, then it is so great you took the test because it's important to know.   I don't know how the specific treatment you're looking at works either. But there's nothing to lose by doing the test and gains through either outcome.",False,False

What if I do have an arrhythmia and they don't take me because of the danger? I don't know how any of this works. No one I've known has been through this and my family never let me get proper treatment so I'm also very confused. My boyfriend supports me emotionally luckily ♡,False,True

Is it getting the results or the test itself? Do you have someone you can work through that fear with? Because it sounds like that's  an important way forward for you. ♥️,False,False
