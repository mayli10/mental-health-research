Its usually not too big of an issue unless you’re restricting. Most “normal” diets are varied enough to touch all bases. But once you start restricting its super important to try and be eating nutrient dense foods and tracking just to avoid any malnutrition or deficiency. I dont mean to get you paranoid and I dont mean to give you another thing to track or be weird about, it can go too far and border on orthorexia. But its good to be mindful of just for the sake of your body functions.",False,False
