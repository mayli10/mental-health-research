I hate gifts because i am a super picky person and will probably dislike whatever someone gets me. I'd rather people not give me anything in general so they don't feel bad when I accidentally make a face(I'm such a bad lier) . I also just don't have a lot of material desires.   A list of gifts I've asked for over the years:  - dish towels  - cumin  - pickles garlic  - socks  - pls no,False,False
