People really have no idea how amazing the people and support here is. Everyone here is amazing and so kind to each other.   It has been really rough, hopefully it gets better. Thanks for your support. ",False,True

It is such a tremendous help to have some place to go and vent. We're not really understood in the general population. It's such a isolating disorder.   Your situation sounds awful and I would not be able to eat either tbh. Im getting dizzy just thinking about it üòÇ I imagine you are just a wreck.  I do hope you get some broth in you though. Stay safe friend.   ,False,False

I need to remember things like that.  I really hope things get better. I've been trying to pray bc it brought me some peace in the past.   I don't want to go into too much bc its messy and long but basically rn, I'm going through something that will change the course of my life, literally. I'm either buying a house and settling here permanently or losing my home, possessions and SO. I'm pretty attached to the life I have now so obviously I want to keep it but its not up to me or my SO, I just have to wait and see what's going to happen. Patience is not my virtue lol   I guess it's the loss of control that has triggered this, I just don't know how to counter that rn.  I really appreciate talking to you, it really means a lot to get this stuff out to someone who understands what it can be like sometimes. üíï",False,True

It makes sense when you look at that way actually. I have some other issues that my SO is convinced is OCD. I'm guessing quite a few of us here probably can relate in some way.   Things will get better for you. This slice of life you find yourself in is temporary. I know I sound like an asshole but it's true üíñ  I have to remind myself of this all the time...  Try to find a few moments for yourself everyday and take some deep breaths. It's totally attainable and can help center you for a moment. Let's you find some peace even if only for seconds.   Sorry for all the suggestions. I just know how this feels and it sucks hard. It's an awful place to be.   My inbox is always open if you need to talk.    ",False,False

I wonder if it would be worth looking into. I know my train of thought is screwed but I have to do this, the alternative fills me with actual terror.  Thinking about it, I fasted when my mom had surgery too, bc I thought if I didn't eat nothing bad would happen to her so I guess this isn't really a new thing. Just a very long time ago thing and I don't remember being this scared.  I'm sorry you didn't get your salad! I've definitely done that exact thing and it really sucks bc you allowed yourself to have something and it was ruined.   Thank you for talking to me, I am super overwhelmed rn. I will try to drink some broth tomorrow if I feel up to it.",False,True

I don't have the same thoughts as you though. They sound very OCD ish. I hope you make it through this tuff time. Stay hydrated.  Try to drink some broth and take some vitamins if you think you absolutely can't eat.‚ù§Ô∏è I hope you can though. These things that are happening are not your fault. Just a rough patch of time that we all go through at some point. It's Sooooo overwhelming.   Realistically, you feel better through this tough time if you can eat a little something everyday. It's hard but I find it really does help stressful times to not completely fast.   I totally fucking understand if you can't eat though. I def don't have a lot room to talk.  I went out to a restaurant the other day and ordered a salad I was dying for. My husband called me upset over something and I straight up canceled my order and went the fuck home and didn't eat that day at all.   Yay eating disorders. üò≠",False,False
