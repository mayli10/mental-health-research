I don’t know exactly what happened (I think maybe my morphine drip ran out?) but there was a point a few hours after one of my surgeries when I woke up screaming my face off in pain. In a few moments I was surrounded by nurses and a doctor was pulling off all the bandages (I was super scared they would catch on the staples and tear me open because he was really rushing). I don’t know what went wrong, what hurt, or what they did to fix it, but it felt like a dream (though not all that scary, just surreal) and no one said anything and I forgot to ask about it, so it couldn’t have been too bad. I’ve also had a dehiscence (when they remove the staples and send you home and you forget to brace while coughing and your incision comes open). It didn’t really hurt, it was just alarming to see. I’m sure it scared my husband way worse than me.    My point being, yes, sometimes things go wonky. But it’s not as bad as you imagine. If it were, women wouldn’t get pregnant again after the first c-section. If you leave a hernia it can be fine or it can get strangled and require emergency surgery. Trust me, you want planned-ahead surgery rather than emergency surgery every time. If nothing else, you can find a doctor that’s done so many hernia repairs he could operate in his sleep. Once again, take care and good luck!",False,False

Thank you so much for your reply, it’s really comforting. I had no idea about the numbing stuff! I’m gonna definitely ask about it!  I’m just mostly freaked that I’m gonna wake up in the middle but be paralyzed and they won’t realize I’m awake. It happened to my grandma during her knee surgery.",False,True

I had been hardcore restricting when I ended up needing emergency surgery on my guts and there were no issues.   I also have a hernia, but it’s not bad enough for surgery. It usually only hurts if I eat too much or lay down too soon after eating. (Or if I go too crazy with sit-ups, which I think is how I got the damn thing to begin with). Anyway, they drug you up great, you start counting backwards from ten, and then wake up in recovery.      If you talk to them ahead of time about your needle phobia, ask if they have the numbing stuff they can rub on your arm before they place the iv, so you literally won’t feel it. Im serious: they rub cold stuff (feels like alcohol or acetone) on and unless you’re a freak like me that likes to watch, you’d never know they stuck you. Not all places have/use it, so ask as far in advance as possible, so hopefully they can accommodate you (though it’s getting more common).     I’m kinda sporadic and weird with my Reddit use, so I may not see it, but if you have any other issues, you can ask. Good luck and feel better soon!",False,False

My advice is to be honest with them when they ask you questions. If they ask what you’ve eaten today, tell them honestly. Be honest about your recent diet if they ask. Be honest if you’ve lost weight recently and they ask. You don’t have to disclose your ED, but be honest about the behaviours and physical effects. Those things *could* impact you if they don’t know.  I hope you have a quick and uneventful recovery ♥️",False,False
