If you think your heart rate is dropping that low you need to see a doctor who can examine you and give their educated answer.",False,False

I was solidly in the middle of a healthy bmi....but because I wasn‚Äôt eating etc. it just caught up to me. I know it is hard, and seeing someone about your heart problems doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you will be forced to recover- but it does let you know where your body is functioning at and how much you‚Äôve let your ED take a toll on your body. It‚Äôs a life and death thing. I‚Äôm at a point in my recovery where I‚Äôm able to see that, but I also understand the complete mindfuck ED is and can be. But at least see a GP and get some blood tests",False,False

But I was in denial too. I definitely know how you feel if you haven‚Äôt reached you ‚Äúgoal weight‚Äù yet or whatever but. that is very dangerous and can kill you.  Now, looking back, I wish I would have gotten help then instead of prolonging it. I don‚Äôt want to scare you but I would strongly suggest getting professional medical advice. Best wishes",False,False

My doctor said it was on the cutoff of what's low enough to warrant urgent care. I got chest pains all the time, too. My lowest was around 42 bpm in the day and in the 30s at night, which was worrying enough that I was sent to inpatient against my parents' wills. So yeah, I'd say yours is low enough to start worrying. Please take care of yourself and try to seek medical attention, even just for vague general advice.",False,False

When I was at my lowest and saw someone about it I was immediately admitted to the ER because my electrolytes were off and I was getting chest pains/ heart fluttering. The doctor was quite upfront with me that starvation can and will hurt your heart and lead to complications or death. nutrient deficiencies can fuck with your electrolyte balances and directly affect your heart and either cause damage or straight up make you drop dead. Get help please üíì,False,False
