Most of us don't have the time or resources for that, or we do but everything else in our lives go to compete shit",False,True

But I honestly just think that so many of very underweight people recovering will recover up to like slightly normal weight/on the middle between underweight and normalweight and still remain skinny which makes me feel so shitty cus like I can't recover know cus I feel like there is nothing to recover from. They still get to stay sorta skinny while I feel I don't deserve recovery when I'm a fatass.,False,False

Like, people follow people with a certain body type, so if you‚Äôre following mostly popular accounts, then it‚Äôs likely that they‚Äôre still gonna be skinny (maybe unhealthily so).   I‚Äôve been around the tumblr/ instagram community for long enough to have seen a couple of accounts reveal that they still overexercise/ have been b/ping regularly in order to maintain their ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù bodies. While I don‚Äôt want to make accusations, people lie a lot, especially for an audience.",False,False
