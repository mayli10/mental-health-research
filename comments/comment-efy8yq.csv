He lies to you 2. He wants to watch porn. You don’t want him watching porn. That’s an incompatibility  3. You’re dealing with so much right now. I really think it’d be best for you to focus on yourself and work on your confidence before you bring another person into the mix. I think it’s shitty that he lied to you and made you feel like it was all in your head, but if being in a relationship with a guy who watches porn exacerbates your body dysmorphia then you shouldn’t be in that relationship. Watching porn is a pretty typical thing to do and if it’s affecting you this much then you need to let him go, otherwise you could end up just controlling him and he’s just gonna continue lying to you  4. If it’s gotten to the point where you’re violating his privacy and looking at his browser history, the relationship is over",False,False
