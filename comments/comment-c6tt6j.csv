Like, it's not a ""does this make me happy"" kinda deal, but rather like... You know the feeling when you pick up a well-balanced hammer and wanna whack something with it, or a plump avocado and wanna split it open, or like, your favorite jacket and you just wanna put it on? That sort of feeling. It's less ""does this make me happy"" and more ""when I interact with this, does it make me want to use it, or am I ambivalent?""  Obviously the show could definitely use *way* more class consciousness, I agree with you there. Based on what Netflix likes to promote though, given they also run Queer Eye, I'd say they're not really aiming for anything along those lines, so it makes sense that the show is very upper-middle-class-y. With regards to Kondo's work independently of Netflix though, I mean, I'm like 80% sure she wrote her book in the context of like, Japanese culture rather than American, and I don't think they have as much of a looming middle class problem as we do",False,True

Throwing out items because they don’t spark joy is not relevant for people living in poverty. This concept makes people living with less even more about invisible and minimizing and invalidates the struggles of getting by in a world of greed, overconsumption, pushing others down to get ahead, and throwing things out because it’s no longer this season’s hot item/out of style, blah blah blah. More people than not can not afford to do this and that is one reason why the average American is carrying so much debt, trying to keep up with their neighbors, keep up appearances, and end up having things they can’t really afford because of these rich celebrity’s promoting these overly simplified concepts that do not really justify an entire book or show and don’t apply to people in poor countries and communities who have to reuse and repair what they have. Joy is not supposed to be found in material possessions anyway. Ugh!",False,False
