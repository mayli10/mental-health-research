Maybe next time you talk to him, bring a written list of everything you want to say, and if it gets hard talking about it or if you feel awkward for talking about yourself then you can just show him the list?",False,False

I wish I could have shared more with my friend but he was just there to listen to me. Which is both good and bad. Good because he won’t pass judgment and will just listen but it’s hard for me to every really talk about my feelings and my troubles with other people without them asking much just because i hate talking about myself. I’m definitely going to talk to him more and really REALLY talk about my feelings but saying out loud and having someone know makes it feels real (because it’s no longer inside my head anymore) and even more urgent for me to recover.,False,True
