In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it‚Äôs a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.  Most of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don‚Äôt realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don‚Äôt eat right, we‚Äôre literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.  I hope that helped.

Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn‚Äôt want her own problems to get in the way of mine.  That said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn‚Äôt want, and it made sense once I met her in person.  (She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that‚Äôs why I saw her in the first place.) I told her that I didn‚Äôt need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I‚Äôd want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn‚Äôt want the patronization of, ‚Äúyou need food for your brain‚Äù or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.  I was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn‚Äôt lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I‚Äôm going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.  Instead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&amp;ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&amp;q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&amp;oq=mirror+exercises+self&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&amp;pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn‚Äôt *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.  For anyone interested, she said: Stand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you‚Äôd tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don‚Äôt believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.

She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like ""you should try Indian food, lots of spices."" That particular phrase was my ""apple cinnamon pop tart"" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules.

She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.  Then there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was ""clean"" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that.   On the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: ""Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????"" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks.   I've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all.
