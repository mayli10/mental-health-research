I don't think that your course leader holds the ultimate truth about you, knows what you are capable of, knows how much you can achieve. Maybe you don't even know how much you have already succeeded in the past, and what your success can look like in the future. (Sorry for sounding like a motivational poster lol)   I'm sort of in the same situation as you; it's really hard to do school work when we are dealing with so much. And failing classes fuels the ED, which makes academia even harder... rinse and repeat.   Don't sink into the earth just yet, you can do this &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",False,False
