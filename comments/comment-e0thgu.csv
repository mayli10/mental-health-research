I used to try to eat 1400cals, and I never thought I could even get through a work shift without eating at least 3 times. Now I eat once, and I get scared once my calories go past 500. Itâ€™s bizarre, but in a month, idea of 1000cals has changed a considerable amount.",False,False

Is it bad when I missed being triggered by everything my skinny and smaller friend said and starve for hours on end?  But now I'e started working out regularly, so that's nice.",False,False

My family is pretty on board with it because I genuinely do seem to have more energy when I do it, and they see me eating healthy. But like when I'm at work explaining why I can't eat the donuts so and so brought in I get weird looks. Or when I get invited to a happy hour and decline because it's outside my window. People look at me weird. Intermittent fasting makes me feel really good and I don't do any of my ED behaviors when I'm doing it consistently so hopefully I can sustain it.  I think I miiiiight be able to do it long term, but idk if I can eat maintenance in one sitting without like adding a bunch of oil to things. I'm vegan so my meals tend to be a bit bulkier because the food is lower-cal without meat.",False,False

Like, can I sustain OMAD for the rest of my entire life? What if I travel and want to try foreign street food? Nutritionally, it's a prefectly healthy diet and more natural for humans than constantly eating is, but I hope I don't get tired of it or give it up for social reasons. It sucks that everyone in real life says eating once a day is insane and unhealthy, but it's a much better way of living for some people. I rarely b/p anymore because of OMAD.

I'm actually using OMAD rn as a way to get healthier. Can't stop binging, want to starve, still need to lose weight because I'm at an obese BMI sooo ... OMAD.  I actually eat 1000-1200 on OMAD most days unless it's high veg and I can't finish because of volume. I plan the meals in advance to balance my macros and get good nutrients etc. It satisfies my urges to fast and binge while making sure I get nutrients in my body and I'm still losing weight.
