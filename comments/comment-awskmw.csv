It is a shameful behavior to eat for me. It is done quickly outside the vision of others. I lie to my partner and family and those around me so much I can barely keep my story straight. When I do feel myself getting stressed I don't have an outlet or healthy ways to cope so I just give up. I binge. I havent purged in a while but it still feels like an addiction that controls me.  I eat until it hurts indiscriminately, whatever I can get until the bites all taste the same..I am dead. I am out of control when I am not in control.",False,False

I've had two this month. I wanted to die after eating both of them, but it was worth it. I think a good way to recover is to focus on eating foods that you love. I see in your flair that you're at a normal weight, so really you don't need to gain weight. You can just go up to maintenance calories and start enjoying foods you currently avoid. I know how hard it is, but it's worth the effort. :)",False,False
