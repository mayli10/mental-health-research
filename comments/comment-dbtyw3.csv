Like ""THIS IS MY MENTAL ILLNESS, NOT YOURS"" lol. I am legit terrified that my sister will tell me she has an ED (which she likely does have anyway) even though I know she won't be able to compete with me, but idk. This is my mental illness. Don't take this from me too :(   But in reality, more people probably have an ED than we realize/know since a lot of don't want to admit we have one or tell others. It's not impossible that your friend would have an ED, or she could just be feeling down about her body/weight recently. But I know how you feel T\_T",False,False
