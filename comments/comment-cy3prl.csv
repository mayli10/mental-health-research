I've been dealing with disordered eating and intrusive thoughts etc for years and my parents kind of knew, since I had a huge breakdown in front of them because of it. However, recently they were looking through my emails and came across some where I was talking to some professionals about it and now they will not stop freaking the fuck out. I mean, I understand that they'd worry and stuff, but I don't think they should be asking questions every five seconds or taking/telling me to eat. I honestly feel like living on my own too sometimes, I feel like it would be the best way to have just have full control over fasting and b/ping and I'd have more independence too!!",False,False
