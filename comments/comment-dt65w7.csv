Hopefully people are just ignorant and don’t realize how outside the norm that actually is. But it’s a double edged sword, because then they may hope for that themselves... :(",False,True

Maybe she doesn't have an ED in the psychological sense, but it's unrealistic and unhealthy to expect to lose weight at that pace!  That's over a daily 2100 calorie deficit, daily, for 8 months. Yes that's the average for the full 8 months, but the reason weight loss gets harder later on is it's harder to get a deficit when your TDEE gets lower as you lose.   Whatever weight you're starting at, that's an unhealthy pace of weight loss.   No judgement on your friend, his sister, whoever, but I think our society is fucked up to praise that when there's just no way it's healthy...unless it was heavily medically supervised.",False,False
