I decided to start doing a thing where I am for a 500 cal deficit every day to be sustainable, but it usually ends up in the 700-1000 range. But I also decided I'm done telling people because they truly do not get it. And they will give the same ""advice"" over and over and not understand how frustrating that is.   Anyways, this friend was like ""oh before we get high (we were doing an LSD trip that day) I'm taking you to denny's and you're eating some of the new crepes."" But he is so triggering to eat with. He has the smallest appetite and is severely underweight. Almost never finished his plate. Absolute hell for someone with an ED. I ate the crepe. Most of the rest of the breakfast, less than 500 cals. I hated it. Tasted like nothing because of the anxiety. ""Oh see that wasnt so bad was it?"" I pretend that no it wasnt. Get an iced coffee (black) so I can shit and be less bloated.  Another time a large group of friends went to denny's and I got the Fit Fare veggie skillet. Lowest cal meal. It arrived and aforementioned skinny friend said ""oh do you want some food with that"" all joking. I put a lot of salt (low blood pressure makes me C R A V E that mineral) and another friend said ""oh jeez got enough salt"" very judgemental. I took a bite. Wasnt salty at all. Said no and looking him in the eyes started sprinkling more salt for a solid 30 seconds. Still wasn't salty enough.  But I hate eating around people because most of my friends know and watch me eat. Like I moved the potatoes from my skillet to the side because I wanted the light veggie ingredients first and the potates second and I could see literally everyone watch me separate potates from the rest. It made me want to just stop eating. I think next time, I WILL just stop eating. Fuck.",False,False

Like if you wanna think about it or if you've just judged someone a few times in private I can understand you made a mistake with the latter(I can't say everyone because idk for sure, but I think most people have gossiped or judged someone else before). But if you're about to judge a person to their face or make a comment about their eating habits and their body, like unless you're my doctor you don't have the right to do so?
