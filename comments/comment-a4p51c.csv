You don't have to be underweight or be completely obsessed with food. Things get worse with time though. I suggest you go seek help ASAP. ",False,False

There's no such thing as ""not sick enough"".  If it's affecting your life to this extent, then you deserve help.  Anyhow, didn't come here to lecture you (but really, please ask your GP for a referral if that's what you want).  I have the shopping anxiety.  I managed to stop it by being all disordered and eating the exact same thing on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.  Sometimes I'll rotate the foods, but it's always the same prepacked food from the same supermarket because I know the calorie values.  I went away with the bf for a weekend break this year.  I didn't think I'd have a problem because the supermarket I shop at would have a store there.  IT DIDN'T.  That supermarket was MILES away and public transport there was shitty.   I went in all the other supermarkets spending AGES trying to find the exact same thing with the exact same calories but it was all screwy and different.  I was getting panicked, visibly shaking and feeling like a massive dick spending so long looking at things and keeping the bf waiting.  In the end I ended up only getting a bland salad every day and some apples.  It was miserable.  Throwback dreams to pre ED when I'd go for pizza or scoff shit loads of corn bread and Mexican dips or amazing veggie feasts.  Damn, I want to recover.  At least it only takes 5 minutes when I'm shopping the same aisles knowing where everything is.  &amp;#x200B;  Oh, and if you feel you want help, as an anorexic I can give my opinion that you need it.  There is no ""not sick enough"".               x ",False,False

Just because you aren't sick enough to need medical intervention doesn't mean you can't do anything. I think having a therapist to talk with about your food related anxiety would be beneficial. It may also be helpful to be medicated for that anxiety. ,False,False
