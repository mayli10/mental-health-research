I really love the cookie dough &amp; cookies and cream flavours, but the texture and flavour of these birthday cake ones is miles ahead of even them!",False,False

They're the most expensive for me to get here they're like a good Â£6-8 more expensive for a box of 12 and I'm afraid I won't like them enough to justify that coooost but if you think they're worth it? ðŸ‘€,False,True

Minus the cookie dough flavor and the peanut one (Deathly allergic to peanuts and I avoid all others. Only safe one isnâ€™t really a nut botanically and thatâ€™s a coconut.)  I really like One Bars, some flavors use almond butter or have almonds/peanuts though and I actually picked up a Blueberry Crumble flavor not knowing it had almond butter because I forgot to double check but their Birthday Cake and Maple Doughnut bars are good. I really like the Maple Doughnut bar warmed up but I remember I ate it with a fork and knife so as to keep my hands clean and make it last longer lol. I didnâ€™t expect them to be so chewy and never had sunflower seed butter until through those bars.",False,False
