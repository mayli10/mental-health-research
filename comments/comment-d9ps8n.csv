Your partner sucks.           I'm *engaged* and if my fiance started pulling this shit I would leave. No one deserves to be with someone who doesn't give a fuck about boundaries.           Even if it's because they're ""worried"". My fiance is worried too. That's why he doesn't make it worse by snooping. He knows I post here, he knows about my private Twitter where I ramble ED thoughts. But does he look at them? No. Never.",False,False
