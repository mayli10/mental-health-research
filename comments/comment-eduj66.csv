People with different backgrounds, different problems, different talents, etc. Not everybody has an ED. And nobody will look at an underweight person and think that they're fat. In fact, people probably won't care about you much at all. I don't say that in a mean way, just to say that you're inconsequential to complete strangers.  Also, I have never heard of that ritual ever before. It sounds so cruel and pointless. It doesn't even sound fun. Also, it's kind of rapey. That would literally be sexual assault. Nobody can strip you without your permission.",False,False

In my HS there was a lot of competition and I always felt people were judging me. Ideal BMI at my school was 15-16.5. I donâ€™t feel underweight. I look healthy, chubby even. Idk it just scares me haha. I heard a horror story about a girl who had Vegemite shoved into her privates and she couldnâ€™t wash for a week. Idk if thatâ€™s true but i canâ€™t say no to minor hazing like fat circles.",False,True

I'll give you my experience.  I don't think you need to worry about anything in your first paragraph. In these programmes the only competition is about grades, learning, and rankings. Beyond that they'll only care about you if they're your friend, but I doubt in a competitive way - perhaps they would try to help you academically if you were falling behind, or they would show concern if it seemed like you were struggling due to stuff that may be ED related, idk, not weight though.  There's no way they'll see you having a BMI of 17.5 and think you're not skinny enough - they want to be doctors for christ sake, they should have some basic understanding of what is healthy and what isn't. We need to keep in mind that ""normal people"" don't think about other peoples weight as much as we do (I say as someone who constantly worries about this). Even if the mean weight is lower in your med school 17.5 is still pretty underweight. You know this. You'll still be lower than average, and your ranking will be by your grades and not BMI.   As for the uni house it does such. The hazings very much depend on where you go to school (is it a big state school?). I've never purged and I always thought bathrooms were horrible, so I feel for you big time.  Edit: Oh, also, good luck! College seems scary but there will be bits that are super fun (in between the bits that are boring but really important).",False,False
