It’s not worth it, friend. It may seem like a huge mountain of a problem where you just can’t see the other side, but I can promise you that people DO overcome their mountains. Seek treatment. If your school and your career are more important to you than your binges, prioritize them. Do it by finding yourself some help and support. Go to your schools counselor if you don’t know where to start, they may have resources. Find people and professionals that can help you come up with a plan to succeed. It may take multiple tries and various plans to find something that works, but nothing is ever worth just ending it all. I believe in you!",False,False

It's really hard to recover on your own from any ED but having people around who know about it and are capable of helping makes your chances of coming out the other end way better. Does your school provide any insurance or in-school mental health help? While talking to a trusted individual around you is a good alternative, they won't be able to help you as best as a compassionate professional can. ",False,False
