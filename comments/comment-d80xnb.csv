I bet it’s because we look more similar minus our weight in addition to being brought up with more similar beauty standards. It also doesn’t help that we get fat-shamed by other Asians at a much lower BMI, too. I was actually never fat-shamed until I started recovering fml.  ETA: There being so many underweight international students makes it seem so easy to maintain their super low BMIs, as well, which I find even more triggering. It’s as if they’ve been so used to eating little their entire lives that restricting doesn’t really feel like restricting to them, if that makes sense. And here I am struggling to eat as little as they do when it’s like second nature to them.",False,False

Just to give an example of how much physical appearance matters in Asia: In Korea, it's not uncommon for parents to give their teens the gift of getting plastic surgery as a birthday/graduation present. Extreme diet culture is also very normalized there. It's really sad ☹️",False,False

Perceiving yourself like that is just a product of body dysmorphia. For example, I know someone that I always thought of as ""super skinny"" and after losing weight I still felt fat and round next to her. However, I later found out she was significantly heavier. Sometimes it's hard for us to see differences in our body if we're used to thinking about ourselves in a certain way.",False,False

I go to a school where there are a lot of international students. I'm also Chinese American myself and when I go to China I don't see extremely underweight people everywhere there, or at my school in fact. :/ Some people with smaller frames are just able to have smaller measurements at a healthy BMI so that could be it.

Before I say anything else, I just want to emphasize that, barring the occasional very weird-shaped person, nobody of any ethnicity should be at a 14-16 BMI. That's never healthy.   However, it may theoretically be less dangerous to be underweight as an Asian person. Compared to other ethnicities, Asians tend to carry more visceral fat at any given BMI. Therefore, ""fun"" fact, Asians are at risk for diseases like Type 2 diabetes at a lower BMI than many people, and the WHO considers Asians to have lower cutoffs for both the ""overweight"" and ""obese"" BMI categories. Some organizations [correspondingly expand the ""normal"" Asian weight category downwards to 17.5](https://www.aace.com/files/obesity/toolkit/classification_of_obesity_and_risks.pdf).   I'm not a doctor, and don't take this as medical advice, or evidence that you are in less danger. But this is what my cousin's endocrinologist told her before advising her to lose weight (bc according to the WHO's guidelines for Asians, she's fairly overweight).",False,False
