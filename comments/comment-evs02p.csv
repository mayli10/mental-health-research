Summer also entails for me eating a lot with my friends and drinking a lot of calories. I always end up gaining and losing the same 5 pounds over and over again. Itâ€™s a relentless hell. Happy birthday ðŸ’•ðŸ’• I hope you had a good day",False,True

In the winter I can hide my skeleton with layers.  I relapse badly in January especially, since there's so much rampant diet culture this time of year from people doing new years resolutions and trying to lose christmas weight, my birthday is today also, which is triggering for me as I feel like I have to be skinny to deserve turning a certain age.   There's less pressure in the Summer so I just binge constantly, even though it's too hot to be hungry and my body is on display. I guess I'm wired wrong.",False,False

It think for me it's the lack of school regimen which makes me get more restrictive",False,False

Iâ€™m more inclined to go out and do stuff if itâ€™s nice out but in the winter I turn into a hermit,False,True

Heat makes me naturally less hungry. Always drop weight in Summer.   And I suppose I stay more active naturally, or more inclined to be active in better weather as well.  Vit D. from the sun is good for energy and metabolism.",False,False
