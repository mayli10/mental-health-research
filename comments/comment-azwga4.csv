I actually had my gallbladder removed when I was 14 (pre-ed) and it doesn’t necessarily feel like a complication of it but if it persists I’ll definitely consider that, thank you again!! :)",False,True

That is also the area where your gallbladder is located. Your gallbladder produces stomach bile that pumps into your stomach for digestion. Eating dissorders can cause damage to your gallbladder as well as gallstones.    Do you find the pain worse in the morning? Does it seem to get worse when you eat fatty foods vs other foods? Is it recurring/remitting? Does it ever get so bad you get nausea/vomitting? These are signs that you may have something wrong with your gallbladder.    This can be treated and sometimes reversed with diet changes (not restricting, not purging, not binging etc) but can also require your gallbladder be removed.   I had my gallbladder out in 2009 when I was 19. I don't think it would have been caused by my eating issues, but honestly who knows. I certainly had binge eating dissorder back then and I was always trying to fast/juice cleanse etc to lose weight. I didn't have gallstones, my gallbladder just wasn't producing/pumping at a normal rate.   Your pancreas is also on the right upper side of your abdomen, as is your liver.   It would be a good idea to discuss this with your primary care provider. They may suggest acid reducers and an ultra sound to start.",False,False
