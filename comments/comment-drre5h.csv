Often it would end up at 10K+ calorie binges. sometimes even 15-20K. I'm so sorry you're going through this too. Tomorrow is a new day, and you're not disgusting. You're struggling with an eating disorder and it's not your fault. It is not a reflection of you as a person,  and had no effect at all on your worth or value. You deserve kindness. More than anything else, you need kindness, and care, and love towards yourself. Not more self hatred. You've done nothing wrong.",False,False

I am now 3 days binge-free. You can be there too. What sort of support do you have in real life? Have you read any pro-recovery books?,False,False

This is just one moment of the many to come. You’ll be okay. Remember that you can’t change the past, only the present. Sending love your way &lt;3",False,False
