I personally want to study things related to how social media affects our communication and behaviors, which involves things like surveys of different demographics and content analysis of specific topics. And if you want to do that, you go where your topic is. If they were looking at, for example, self esteem in bodybuilders, they would go to a bodybuilding subreddit.   Whether we like it or not, we are a demographic. Honestly, eating disorders are extremely understudied. Contributing to research and expressing your thoughts and feelings could lead to findings that could help with treatment or societal understanding. I think it’s a good thing!",False,False

It's a highly respected research university, and by current IRB standards, that study wasn't illegal or unethical. The study's publication did, however, piss off and upset a lot of people on the old sub, including me - and I think we had the right to be upset.

There is no verification that anyone here is diagnosed. Even if there was verification, actual peer reviewed research usually has more parameters than just having an eating disorder. For example, if someone is trying to use my comments for research, they wouldn't know that I have different chronic mental and physical illness that I have had since birth. The ""research"" projects that I see around subreddits are just anecdotal evidence from comments and surveys... I don't think they are meaningful scientifically.   I say this because I get emails ahout medical research in my area and never have I been able to participate. They are always looking for very specific people because research needs to be way more controlled.",False,False
