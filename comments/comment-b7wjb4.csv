Firstly because I'm poor and secondly because usually after two I feel a little headachey.   However my coffee consumption is an infinite void.   And I don't worry about the mild stimulants I take.   So I suppose thirdly because I've got weird priorities. ,False,False

I track milligrams of caffeine every day to make sure no huge spikes (heart racing/anxiety) or any big dips (fatigue/depression).  If you’ve been having 300-400mg regularly, 3 monsters might be okay.  But obviously you should try your best to limit it.",False,False

I have at least that before I even get to work. Literally today I had 3 large mugs of coffee, a Diet Coke and a green tea. That’s 600+ easy. And today was an entirely normal day for me. In fact, I usually have another coffee once I get to work, or a Monster.  How have I not died yet?? This has been my life for the last 4+ years. ",False,False
