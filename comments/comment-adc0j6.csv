I guarantee he'll start telling you how he likes you skinny, so he can pick you up and it makes him feel manly and shit. That stuff, is hella red flag.

Glad you had fun :) I’m chuckling a little because I’ve lost track of how long my dry spell has been...more than three years. But I got some hangups in the physical department.  The SH scar thing would be a big red flag for me, at least as far as becoming emotionally involved with this person. That’s kinda a concerning perspective. But if the sex is good and they’re kind and willing to be respectful of boundaries...nothin wrong with having fun.",False,False
