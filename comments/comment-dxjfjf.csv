BUT the weirdest thing is that i had 2 churros and a coffee with milk for a super late ""breakfast"" this morning (cultural eating experience) and didnt feel guilty cause the cals weren't too bad (based on my extensive research lol). BUT THEN i went to a healthy restaurant for a late lunch and felt so guilty because i should've just been able to only eat the churros and felt weird about THIS super healthy, nice food. spinach salad was covered in oil, everything was covered in some nut-based sauce. was so hungry i ate the 4 slices of tofu given to me and i felt like a dumbass. and then i got home rly late from my flight and had some soup for dinner super late even though im not rly THAAAAT hungry (but became ravenous as i was eating lol).   &amp;#x200B;  I KNOW my cals arent THAT bad and also im UW and it's can be really difficult to gain weight and i probs gained max 1lb which i can live with cause i'd still be underweight lol but idk...   &amp;#x200B;  tl;dr: long weekend of vacation where i had mini mental breakdowns yet pushed through some intrusive ED thoughts. just needed to vent, sorry for htis being so long lol",False,False

My scale says I am 5 lbs higher if it’s on a certain part of the floor, and 5 lbs lighter on another part of the floor. I don’t really believe the lower number because I feel like my legs are flabbier than ever but it’s possible because I’ve been restricting for the last 6 weeks. But I know scales are often inaccurate and have to be calibrated but I don’t think mine can be calibrated. So now I feel like I have to lose more weight than I initially thought to have the body I want. My weight hasn’t dropped in the last week and I hope it’s just water retention masking it because I was in a caloric deficit every day. I can’t decide what my TDEE is because I’m pretty sedentary most days. I want to walk more so I can lose weight faster but  I’m afraid it will stimulate my appetite too much.   I’m super anxious about thanksgiving and seeing my family because I always feel like my siblings are judging me on my weight and how much I eat. And I’ve always been a “better” eater and heavier than both of them so if they see I’ve lost weight and I’m eating less they’re going to notice it right away.  I’m also afraid that restricting is going to affect my performance in school. I really want to maintain my grades this semester and we’re getting to the end so the tests matter more now. And I really do want to learn the material.. I’m also afraid that my classmates will notice that I have been losing weight.  Even if I lose weight it doesn’t seem to matter because my body fat percentage is so high.. my legs seem to hold all the fat on my body. I really dislike them, they are short for my height and I have thick ankles and knees so they can never really look thin. And the fat doesn’t budge. I don’t feel like I look any different than I did at 15 lbs heavier? I wonder if it’s just water weight that I lost and I’m really the same size? I know I need to exercise more to get leaner but I sort of hate going to my gym now. It’s always crowded and it’s kind of dirty.",False,False

But you know, i went to the gym after so OBVIOUSLY that's all fine for me to just do right. Burned like 700 calories in total from exercise and my usual walking.
