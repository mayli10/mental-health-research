I talked to my doctor and he is going to help me lose weight in a healthy way. He said it’ll be easy so we will see. I appreciate your support! Being pregnant is hard and postpartum is harder. Hope to have some sort of confidence by this time next year,False,True

You spent 9 months being pregnant, your body won’t bounce back in only 2. The only thing I can think that might help is looking on forums where other people are or have been in similar situations. Also try searching for Instagram accounts of influencers who are pp and aren’t trying to sell the stupid myth or pressure that you should bounce back immediately. DONT choose to follow the ones who present life like it’s perfect because that’s obviously a false narrative. Choose ones that post the bad with the good as it will help to normalise what you’re going through. Remember you’re not alone and lots of women have experienced almost exactly the same thing as you, there are people who know what you’re going through ❤️",False,False

We aren’t breastfeeding anymore but we did for 9 weeks. I am seeing my doctor tomorrow to see if there’s anything he can help me with, maybe to get my hormones back on track. I know you said 2 months pp is nothing but it really doesn’t feel like it. I’m embarrassed to be seen. How do you get over that? Any advice?",False,True

You just grew and birthed a whole damn human. You grew a brain, lungs, a digestive system, a pumping heart all inside yourself. Give yourself and your body a break and work harder at being patient and believing that your body will return. Or that you’ll at least lose the weight naturally. 2 months PP is NOTHING. Don’t pressure yourself like this",False,False
