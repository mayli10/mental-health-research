I also don't want her to know calories because it's a fucking nightmare to know exactly how much is in everything. I observed her eating habits.

She eats whatever she wants and doesn't obsess about food. I learn a lot thanks to her. For example how to eat noodles without feeling like dying lmao.",False,False

They developed a certain eating habit that has a healthy amount of calories without actually looking at how many there are. So for example: they might start to weigh a bit more, so they cut out the midnight snacks and work out a bit more and then loose that weight again. They didn't count the calories, they just cut something unhealthy in their lives. People know what has a lot or very few calories pretty well. Even though they might not know exactly how much is in it. Also this comes with experience after eating. Oh I eat a burger and don't go hungry for 4 hours.
