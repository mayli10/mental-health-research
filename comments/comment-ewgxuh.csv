I have an appointment with my local public dental team on Wednesday and hopefully I can get it pulled there or referred to a dentist for free with my health care card (aka what I meant when I said disability card). I went to my doctor today to see if he thought I should go to the hospital or just wait and he gave me some antibiotics and pain killers so hopefully that will help it and tie me over until then. I'm so glad I know about this now for any emergencies my family or I have, I had no idea it existed. Thank you so much! You've been a huge help.",False,True

As soon as there is swelling, bleeding , you should definitely go in to ER. If you don't want to do that I think the only option is seeing a GP and they'd know more what to do. I know that there's an emergency dental triage team that a GP can refer you to where they heavily discount stuff. And maybe a gp would know more about cheap places /universities .  I had my teeth extracted via the emergency room because my jaw was swollen and wouldn't close properly. I'm not sure what a disability card would help with - if it's a pension card or health care card then you can get free dental but I think there's a waiting list then  that's based on severity of symptoms.       Sorry I can't be of more help! I hope you can find help asap, it sounds horrendous tbh",False,False

I could try and help find you someplace that is either cheap or free if you want. I also live in Australia and have had to have x-rays of my jaw and an extraction for my wisdom teeth and managed to get it free!  I think what some  people do is go into emergency room when the pain becomes unbearable and then they extract it for free then bit waiting that long is honestly scary. infection might set in, and do permanent damage to your jaw it it get to the bone. I 100% endorse finding a bulk billing GP and they will either send you to a public hospital (where it's free) or they will contact a cheap dentist, and make a request on your behalf. Do you have a Centrelink health care card?  Like the other person said, there are universities that offer cheap dental.

It has increased in later years though. I have gone to some private clinics sometimes for quick consulations by specialists but with wages it's definitely cheaper here. It is good if you don't want to wait.  The biggest problem here is definitely waiting times if you need specialist treatment or an operation. I had to wait 7 months for an operation and I don't even think it's that long compared to other operations. Also mental health care is fucked. Not enough beds, long waiting lists and you might get rejected if you're not ""sick enough"". Fun.",False,False

I totally fucked up my teeth from purging and ended up getting a severe infection that spread to my sinus cavity. My whole face got swollen from the infection. If I hadn’t gotten/taken the antibiotics it would’ve spread to my optic nerve then to my brain. If you try pulling it yourself it may break off leaving the root in and it’ll require surgery. In the states we have dental services from the Salvation Army- an extraction runs about $180usd but it doesn’t include lidocaine or nitrous.   If you haven’t, try clove oil. Put some on a small cotton ball and it’ll help some. It’ll at least keep it clean as clove is antibacterial.",False,False

Medicare is great, but certain private health insurance is like getting a ""go straight to the front of the line with this ticket"" card. There's lots of ""bulk bill"" aka free doctors, but specialists always cost money. On only medicare, I paid $300 for a guy (who was a huge asshole the whole visit) to prescribe me some seizure meds and shrug his shoulders when I ask if he could narrow down the cause. It's so fuck.

You have to send an application through social services. I don't know how strict they are about it and the social services here can be really slow and quite complicated tbh. It's free for children.  I just googled the price at the dentist a&amp;e here and pulling a tooth would be 210 aud (converted norwegian kroner to aud lol). We have higher wages here but it's still kinda bad for people with low wages.  It sucks you still use the insurance system over there. Is it like a regular payment type thing no matter what? Unless you go private most public doctor consultations and specialists you need here are under or around 50 aud. I think dentistry should be the same it shouldn't have to be sUpEr BaD.,False,False

The fact Norway doesn't cover it either surprises me since you guys are so good with public health. We've finally got health insurance back but are behind on payments, plus the extraction upfront is still like $200 so we need that plus the money to get up with our bills. It sucks so much.  I think they only cover it if you lose a tooth (like in an accident) and go to hospital for it, but even that may need separate coverage. Either way, it's totally fucked.
