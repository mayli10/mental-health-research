It helps to eat lots of foods with soluble fiber. It helps by absorbing water and adding bulk to your stools (note: stay away from INsoluble fiber- it is not digestible and will make things worse). For instance, oats, black beans, barley, citrus fruits, apples, strawberries, and peas all have a good amount of soluble fiber.   You already said you’re drinking a lot, but make sure you’re also getting a good amount of electrolytes too. Electrolytes lost during a laxative episode can make stomach cramps worse.",False,False
