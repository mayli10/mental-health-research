She put zucchini halves in the oven, with parmesan on top and a little drizzle of oil. They were absolutely delicious!!  Also pumpkin/butternut soups, maybe try making your own cranberry jelly with sweetner instead and add orange zest and nutmeg etc :) or maybe find a version of low cal deviled eggs!",False,False

Roast in the oven at 400 until the cauliflower is softened and crispy on the outside. I think it could work as an appetizer as well! It is always very popular with my family, one of the few things with no leftovers from what I've seen. ",False,False
