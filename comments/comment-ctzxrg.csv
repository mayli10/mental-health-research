I was planning on using it and than putting it back the way I found it. It was really embarrassing, but I just played dumb. It might have been a good thing because it definitely delayed my ED. Now, I put my scale some where that isn't as accessible, like in the box it came in inside my closet. I like knowing I have one, but I don't like to be reminded by having it out in the open.   &amp;#x200B;  I been there, though &lt;.3.",False,False
