I'm glad my response could be reassuring to you. It's okay that you aren't ready for recovery yet. It's always something to consider down the line and recovery happens in everyones own time. Whenever you decide to receive professional help or need some extra support, my suggestions could possibly be steps for you in the future. I understand your feelings associated around BMI. I know how that is and how it feels but you honestly don't seem stupid to me based off what you have wrote. You make your own decisions at the end of the day and I totally respect that, I just hope though that you try to be safe and try to take care of yourself :)",False,False

I don’t think I’ll recover yet but I may consider it later. I feel like I can only focus on school when I have a bmi under 18, anything above that and I feel fat and stupid. It’s dumb I know but mentally I feel smart and disciplined when I’m smaller. I think I’ll lose weight to a place where I’m comfortable with myself and then maintain :)  Thanks again!",False,True

I know how overwhelming weight changes can become at times especially when entering a school environment. I am sure you are beautiful despite that and we usually see ourselves in the worst way. No one probably views us as bad as we view ourselves which is the sad truth. Even if people were to comment or tease you, they are just jerks and unfortunately there will always be bullies in life no matter how you look or where you are. They probably feel insecure or have something bad going on in their own life to feel the need to be that low of a person and degrade another human. Please try your best to ignore mean comments and focus on any good or kindness directed towards you (hard to do I know. It is a skill to practice everyday).   You want to do well in your studies I'm sure! It is difficult to function and concentrate when you aren't properly taking care of yourself. A BMI of 15-18 is usually not healthy and a BMI of 19 is barely considered healthy especially if you are an adult. Numbers seem to have so much power over us when they shouldn't. It's hard to let go of obsessions with your stats or at least in my experience. I think maybe a therapist who specializes in eds or a school counselor could help you if you decide to try speaking with them or haven't done so already. Maybe also a support group with people going through the same could help shift your thinking in a more positive direction. It is great to get support and not feel as alone! This is all just suggestions for you to consider.    I tried something in high school during my eating disorder and found it so helpful. I recommend you try it if you haven't. Rather than focusing on my peers (their chats, looks, ect. anything irrelevant to school) I put all my mental energy and focus into my school work and getting good grades. It helped somewhat by taking me away from the toxic things in my environment. At first it wasn't easy to be out of tune with people around me but after awhile it got easier! As for social stuff if you are worried about that, I interacted with people outside of school. People who I knew weren't as judgmental and I could be more carefree with. Stay strong and good luck at uni! :)",False,False
