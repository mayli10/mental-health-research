Even on the rare occasions I ate below 1000, it was only temporary anyway, like ""oops an accident."" Hunger is natural, I'd think. Aching bones and pain are just an unfortunate side effect of my weight. Dizzy and hypoglycemic? I eat. I look forward to the times my bf takes me out to a buffet where I'll eat 2000+ cals in a single sitting and feel less obsessive over food the next few days, but still lose weight because of the average deficit  When I hit somewhere around underweight (I never weighed myself but I remember what I looked like the last time I was there), I just thought ""well I'm short and I feel fine, the same way a lot of naturally underweight people do."" When I was probably around BMI 15 judging by pictures, I thought, ""well I don't like spending money on food so what should I expect? I eat when I really want to so I'm fine."" It took me over a year and a half to go from BMI 23 to 13, so the change was so gradual that I always ""got used"" to seeing myself as normal, though obviously skinnier than average.  I thought of myself as underweight and physically sick, not mentally the way an ED is seen as. It's sort of like depression. I'm honestly kind of baffled how I managed to get to such a low point that I tried to off myself, because there was never a point when I thought ""I was so happy just yesterday, what happened?"" Or any traumatizing event. It just seemed like those feelings gradually set in",False,False

I didn't think it was that bad. after I recovered and saw what I  looked like at the height of my restriction a while back was when I realized it got baaad. I wasn't quite sure whether or not I *actually* had one even knowing my doctors concern while it was going on. I didn't know what the fuck I looked like back then but I knew I was in pain and wanted people to be nice to me. I thought people might be nicer to me if I was thin and I didn't care about hurting myself in the process. that was hard to let go of.,False,False
