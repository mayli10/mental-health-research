I am trying to not obsess over it and doing my best. I had actually planned on getting a sundae today as well as applying for a job at a restaurant.   i feel like i can keep telling myself that ill stop once i get to my goal weight but from experience and people telling, thats probably not going to happen.  I really appreciate your concern and ill try to do my best at ignoring the thoughts but its hard, you know?",False,True

Maybe that's why i don't feel like i need help either",False,True

I know it is very hard and weird for me to mention any of my disordered behaviors to my irl friends, and even recently when I spoke with my therapist about it, it was super weird.

I've been spending a lot of time on ED-centric forums and in related tags on other websites, and although I find the content excruciatingly relatable, I can't help but feel like a fraud or a faker. As if I wasn't trying hard enough to be anorexic and should strive to starve myself better or something. It sucks, but hey, in a way, it's just more proof of self-hatred and disordered thinking.",False,False

Stop now while you can, I beg you! I didnâ€™t get the help I needed when I was younger... my ED began 15 years ago when I was 14. It is as bad as itâ€™s ever been and I am dying. I am scared. I am trapped and alone inside of my head, inside of this decaying fleshy cage.  Talk to your mom, your sibling, your school counselor, a friend- anyone. Start now. The longer you wait to get help, the further the eating disorder will grow into you and rot you from the inside out. ðŸ˜¿",False,False
