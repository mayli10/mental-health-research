Apparently the constant eating you describe is normal after long term restriction. Just in case knowing that it's normal would make you feel better.,False,False

A good interviewer doesn't care about you - race, gender, weight etc, but rather what good YOU can do to the company and/or school. What your goals and motivations are, why you deserve the role over others etc. I would recommend reading Interview Tips and Guides found via Google so you can practice and feign some confidence to win them over initially!  Now for clothes - it sucks, but it's not the end of the world. A lot of women our size work in offices because it's sedentary. I would recommend wearing black in areas where you want to slim (pants for legs, a blazer to nip in the waist) and a neutral coloured blouse to show professionalism. Flat black shoes pulls any look together. Not to mention wearing light make up will also distract from the body at least a little.   I hope this helps!  ",False,False

Also if you have one, I actually found some great business clothes (including an awesome suit with bright blue pinstripes with a cute blue lace-lined top under) at Lane Bryant—better still if there’s an outlet.  The nice thing about Lane Bryant is that since it’s all plus size there’s not tha feeling like you’re too big for everything in the store.  Honestly, since I relapsed, I have no idea where to shop because I’ve been shopping there exclusively for years when I was in a management position. (If anyone has suggestions hit me up please.)  If you’re on a strict budget, Ross and Marshall’s are good if you’re somewhere that has those.  Lastly, literally 1/3 of the earth’s population is overweight, so there’s a pretty good chance that the person looking at your CV/application is overweight—even more so if you’re in the US (or any of the 27 countries with even higher obesity rates) where the majority of people are overweight.

Something fitted at the waist but loose elsewhere can make a person look slimmer, as can black and vertical stripes. If a job or school doesn't accept you based on weight, just keep in mind that you likely would have been miserable there. I hope you can start to feel better about yourself. There is always a way to complement your body with the clothes you wear. Don't be afraid to ask for help from the workers in the store, that's part of their job!  Good luck, we're here for you",False,False
eebsrhr,t3_ah63kr,t3_ah63kr,Mukbangs,1,2019-01-17 21:46:39,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ah63kr/im_the_fattest_ive_ever_been_and_im_so_scared/eebsrhr/,"Schools want students who will benefit their stats along with humanity, so they aren't looking for student's looks. Essentially, they're looking for an individuals mental aspects rather than physical. Also, if a school is accepting students based off looks, then they're certainly not a school worth giving money to nor attending anyways!  You have lots of expirence in the field you're applying for. That's what matters, that's what interviewers are looking for. If they just chose someone with far less credentials just because they weighed lesss then.... they're making their own field and occupation look bad, ya know?  Interviews and applying for schools is so stressful, I cannot count the number of times all that has made me cry. While this post of yours hurts my heart, it also shows me how deserving you are of getting accepted into the schools. It shows you care, that you want this. Many people don't have that, so that just makes you special + more qualified ; )! If you can 'awe' and amaze someone (me) through a Reddit post then I can garuntee you that you'll shock (in the best way possible) your interviewers and recruiters.    While I don't really know tips about the clothes, just know that everyone on this sub is gonna be mentally cheering you on. Maybe you don't feel like you look your best, but we'll all think that you do for you. I do hope you can find something you'll like though! I'm sure your interview will go well, maybe when it's over update us how it went? I wish you the best. ",False,False

Like no matter what you look like, what is exciting is moving on with life.   I’m at my highest weight ever in my life right now but I’m also doing the best I’ve ever done in school throughout my whole life, we both know it’s likely because I’m eating food and can function.   Following the good things, the rest will fall into place eventually. We’ve all been unemployed before and felt like 1000 lbs but it’s all subjective. Feel better. ",False,False
