After a short while it only contributed to my depression.  One of the reasons trying to recover fucks me up so much is it depresses me how I can't eat what I want when I want to.  It's all focused on eating and I can't do it.  Thinking about calories is depressing af and waiting houuurs until I can eat something lousy, tasteless and non satisfying doesn't give me a buzz because I'm strong for resisting...it just makes me want to take a rope in to the woods.",False,False

I felt like I was going insane.

I feel more in control of things.",False,False

I didn't want to get out of bed, I didn't want to go into work, I was exhausted and couldn't go out later with friends, and I was snippy with everyone around me. I really do think I replace my depression with my ED behaviors. So long as I'm actively working towards restriction, even if I have a few binge days, I'm okay, but the moment I start working towards recovery I fall apart",False,False

My ED always comes back full force when Iâ€™m depressed.  Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s because I lose my appetite when Iâ€™m depressed, which then spirals into ED, or if the ED just starts as soon as my depression. However, whichever one it is, once my ED is back, the crippling sadness and inability to move goes away and is replaced with numbness and apathy. I like completely lose my emotions. All I care about is my exercise and my eating, nothing else penetrates that defense mechanism. Honestly, at this point I look forward to it. At least I get to lose weight as my life goes down the drain. And feel nothing. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

I was just explaining this to my partner the other day and it really didn't make sense to them. Restricting makes me feel in control and I guess for me control is the closest thing to happiness that's attainable at the moment. Also definitely distracts me from the thousand other problems I should be focusing on fixing instead. When I'm losing weight at least something good is happening in my life.,False,False

Thatâ€™s not to say itâ€™s always good and eventually it gets out of control and goes downhill very quickly because I start to become obsessive about weighing myself, exercising multiple times a day, taking diet pills after I eat anything, and fasting, but when Iâ€™m low key restricting is when Iâ€™m happiest.",False,False
