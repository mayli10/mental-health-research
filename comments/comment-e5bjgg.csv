And even then, your dose may need to change over time.      Prozac by itself made me gain about 5 pounds quickly before I realized what was happening and I started counting calories again because I was SO exhausted, to the point that I was sleeping for 12 hours a day and not doing a whole lot. My emotions were really flat too. I didn't feel as depressed so it was still a positive change, but I didn't feel alive either. Just calm and ""eh"". I had a lot of mental fog and had a hard time concentrating on things, though my mental fog and concentration WERE still improved relative to no prozac.     Prozac + wellbutrin has been really amazing for me.  I take 30 mg a day and at first took 150 mg wellbutrin. It's been upped to 300 mg recently because the 150 did help me feel emotions again, but my focus still wasn't-quite-great and I still felt spacey. I've switched to 30 / 300 and have been on it for about 2 weeks - it's going great so far. I might titrate the wellbutrin back down eventually when I learn how to better handle my shit. I'm not there yet.",False,False

Basically‘weight-neutral’ is the watchword.   I did not experience weight side effects with any of the meds below (and I think they’re considered weight-neutral but a psychiatrist should have specific info available).   My issue is primarily constant moderate anxiety so my preferred med has been **Buspar**, which is taken daily (I was at 3x daily) and builds up in your system. A big plus for me is it’s not addictive.   Some anxiety meds are prescribed ‘as-needed’ (PRN) and meant for temporary relief from acute symptoms. They tend to act quickly and have a fairly short half-life. **Benzodiazepines** (eg. Klonopin, Ativan, and Xanax) are like that, but note that addiction to benzos is a legit risk. I’ve also had **hydroxyzine** (an antihistamine) and **gabapentin** (nerve pain med) prescribed off label for anxiety. These pack less punch but my understanding is they are safer for extended use.   Good luck! Anxiety was eating away at my life and my mind and it’s such a relief to get it more manageable. Hope you can find something that works!",False,False
