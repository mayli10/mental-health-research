Nasal metabolic rate. Itâ€™s what the body burns naturally every day. Like if you didnâ€™t do shit all day and just stayed in bed thatâ€™s what your body would burn. You can calculate it online through a calculator you just need to know your current height, weight, and age. If youâ€™re below that, your body will burn it all off and anything you gain is water weight. If youâ€™re above it, itâ€™s still not bad you canâ€™t gain a huge amount in a day and if you do, again, it is water weight.",False,False
