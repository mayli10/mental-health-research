She should not eat so much it's not even healthy, like she could try 3000 but damn 5000? Then why not 10000?",False,False

Even if you're doing IE, your checks are still things like hunger and satiety signals. Humans need structure, whether that comes from artificial means like calorie or macro counting or more ""natural"" ones like hunger cues and fullness signals or a small appetite.   It's up to a person's individual relationship with their body and food to determine what sort of structure they need in a diet. Stephanie's relationship with food and her body is all sorts of fucked up, that's why she experienced extreme hunger in the first place. But someone like that likely should've gained weight under a specific meal plan supervised by a doctor and a dietician, not gone balls to the wall binge eating 3500+ cals a day every day for months.",False,False

If you have disordered eating it's possible you actually need to be more, not less, regimented. Please remember the individual who suggested this is *not* a physician, nurse practitioner, or registered dietitian. Stephanie gets a lot of respect for being a PhD but it's in biology, NOT anything psychological or food science related. Unchecked eating is no more healthy than starvation.",False,False

I often hear the argument pro intuitive eating that people stop eating too much chocolate or ice cream or whatever they crave when they know they're allowed to eat them - doesn't work for me at all.  I tried intuitive eating and got overweight in a short amount of time, while getting hungrier and hungrier and craving more and more food instead of less - which then made me go back to restricting.   Over the years I tried it a few more times while carefully watching my weight and it never worked, maybe my hunger cues are just completely ruined.  What I'm trying to say is that I often read that it works for everyone and I think that is not true.   For people that are able to stay at a healthy weight it's probably the best method, and I really wish I could do it, but I can't.",False,False

I know I can't stay at a healthy weight without watching what I eat - my body is not smart, it's an idiot.

It's not like she's obese, she's simply trying to get her appetite back to normality as well as her relationship with food.  I'm so happy for her, and there's a lot of evidence which shows that once the extreme hunger stops and you begin eating with normalised hunger cues you begin to lose the weight and water retention and slowly let your body fat % to a healthy point.   The only scary part of her journey is the thing we all fear the most - the weight gain, and unless you're in the mindset for recovery it's not something which you can easily accept (and even then it's very very difficult to accept your body at a larger size)",False,False
