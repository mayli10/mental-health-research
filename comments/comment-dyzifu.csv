I stopped eating in front of my roommates because one of them kept commenting on my portions like I don’t understand what makes ppl think it’s okay or their reasoning behind commenting on other ppls food like what did u gain from that ???,False,False

I can only eat my safe food with others around (or else unsafe food would trigger the ""all or nothing"" mindset and I would binge like mad). So usually I eat watermelon when they eat lunch, and this one insensitive friend once said ""OMG SHE'S EATIG WATERMELON AGAIN. You dont know this but SHE IS SERIOUSLY ADDICTED TO WATERMELON"" I was so embarrased... Im not addicted to my safe food. I was so ashamed... And this kinda triggered my ED to a level higher. Now when I'm with my friends, I don't eat at all. Eating is weakness. So nothing. No watermelon. I'm not addicted bitch. Meh, hate how everything triggers my ED to the next level LOL. I still hate that moment when she said that I'm addicted to watermelon outloud. There were like 10+ people I knew around and I was so fucking embarrased. They all heard her. Hate her insensitivity.",False,False

I find it funny tbh so I play into it. My parents would do it because I would be the last to finish dinner as a kid. My friends do it at dinner in the dining halls - usually I eat less than, start before, and finish after them. I've always been that way, it's just slowed down more now. That's not the triggering part though.  Now, if I eat at a normal pace, they make lighthearted comments about me 'devouring' it. I know they mean it jokingly but all I can think about it how I ate too much too quickly and now they think I'm fat.",False,False

I have been overweight my entire life, even when I was a baby and toddler. One time my dad was going on a rampage because someone ate half of his chocolate bar. He was super, super mad. My brother and I were like 9 and 10. My mum then said “Well we know it wasn’t iampieman, because she would have eaten the whole thing!” to try and calm my dad down and it sort of worked, he laughed and stopped being as angry.   It’s such a dumb thing to remember, and not that serious, but there were so many comments like that growing up that I just can’t stop thinking about and are just fueling my disordered behaviour. They were just jokes to my family, but upsetting to me.   At the time I just had to laugh despite being hurt because it actually made everyone else laugh and I was tryna stop my dad from being mad again.",False,False

She meant well but it made me feel humiliated mostly because I thought she meant I’m fat so I should eat more,False,False
