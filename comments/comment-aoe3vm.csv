You know, I feel like we are in such similar positions!!  I had a really hard time sleeping last night as well and that always pulls me towards unhealthy habits and spurs cravings for sugar/junk (which for me causes insane binge cravings).  I literally woke up this morning and first thing started looking up girl scout cookie sales locations.  lol   However, I had some coffee and my normal yogurt.  I ""splurged"" and allowed myself an extra granola bar and then went to the gym.     I'm wishing you the best day today.  And you are totally right- Just thinking about making it through today really helps me too.",False,True

I thought my day was going to be shitty because I couldn't sleep at all last night and I always get hungry if I'm tired. I did so well eating healthy for a month, I've been pulled towards bingeing for the last few days and I'm trying so fucking hard not to purge ever again and I haven't all year, but I'm trying to lose weight also which bingeing does NOT help with lol so you have inspired me to at least get through today. So thank you too! And sorry for the rant ",False,False

B/p habits are so hard to break but you are stronger ðŸ’ª  Maybe on the days you normally do this have a nice healthy meal prepped and waiting for you at home that you genuinely enjoy...   Like I usually want to b/p when my kids are with their dad (divorce) so before they leave I make prep two meals of pan chicken breast and asparagas cause fucking yummmm... then when the time comes I go eat this and usually feel really good about it. Hope this helps, sending love ðŸ’•",False,False

It is so validating and awesome to know that I am not alone.    I did it!!!!  I got home and just put on my dogs leash and took him out. Now I am sitting in bed and drinking tea and snacking on some sliced mushrooms (I know kind of weird, but I really like them ha!)   Thank you so much again.
