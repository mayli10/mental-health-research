Or eat maintenance on the days there are holidays and markets etc? It is too sad for me to go to the markets and fairs and stuff and not participate at all, on those days I try to be flexible for myself. This season is hard for balancing it all. And if you decide not to restrict at all, I think that is fine! I think a lot of us might be making similar decisions. Also -- you already reached a major goal (only halfway through the year!!) which is awesome, congrats!",False,False
