Its not an easy thing to say I need help, I'm vulnerable but it is the only way to truly move forward.  Money is such a tricky thing. Its needed but can also be toxic. Ultimately you did the best thing you could do for those kids which is share your experiences to keep them safe. That's not a small thing even if it doesnt turn out the way you want it too. If you hear anything more in the future and are really afraid you can always call child protective services. Not a great option  for a lot of reasons but if they are not safe and you think they might've been assaulted it  would be worth thinking about.  And my door ( inbox) is always open. ðŸ™‚",False,False

I did end up going to the hospital yesterday because I ran out of the car and threatened to kill myself. At least I got to go home after. I feel like I embarrassed my family. I know I didnâ€™t but I really feel like it. Beating myself up so badly right now.  More Iâ€™m still in shock that my aunt chose being with my uncle because of the money. I told her what happened because Iâ€™m concerned about her children. I want them to be safe. Theyâ€™re not if heâ€™s here.,False,True

Iâ€™m just happy yet sad that people over the internet believe me but my own aunt and grandmother donâ€™t. Iâ€™m 100% she stays with him because of money. Essentially they chose money over me.,False,True

Your rapist uncle POS did.  2. Eating disorders are a mental illness. So again YOU did NOT fuck up your family.  3. If you are feeling suicidal which is common after rape and with mental illness I strongly suggest either going to the hospital or calling a suicide hotline. You dont deserve to die and it wont make it easier.  I'm truly sorry this happened. Many of us including myself have been raped and the depths of how much that sucks is deep. But people can and do recover. It's hard and it's a long road but it's real.  Recory from this mental illness is also real. But again it's a long road and it's hard. And it's not linear. If you want to PM me anytime you're more then welcome to. ðŸ’—ðŸ’—,False,False
