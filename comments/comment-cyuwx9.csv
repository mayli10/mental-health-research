At this point, skinny adults - esp women, but my dad is now struggling to find clothes too - are kinda SOL at normal stores. I for one mostly only fit into kids' sizes. (And not just bc I'm FtM.

Not because I'd gotten skinnier, but because the adult clothes just kept getting L A R G E R.)  So I've mostly only shopped vintage for years.
