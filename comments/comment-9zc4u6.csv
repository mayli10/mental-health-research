Making yourself gag until you throw up is not normal eating behavior, no matter if you do it once a year or after every meal. Chances are, if you think you've got one, you probably have one.  &amp;#x200B;  I strongly encourage you to seek professional help if you can. Mental illness is not something you ever want, and treating it early saves you a world of pain. Good luck &lt;3",False,False
