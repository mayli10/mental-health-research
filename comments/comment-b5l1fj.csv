You did not really mention it in your post, except for the chicken tenders, but how are you with pre-packaged meals?   A lot of people here with EDs enjoy the comfort of packaged food/meals as opposed to making their own meals from scratch, because they clearly display the calories contained in them. While you don't have an issue with calories, maybe packaged/pre-prepared meals with provide more comfort in regards to feeling safe when eating, as minimal involvement is required to prepare the food (you would only need to put frozen meals in the oven, or things like soup packets in a microwave/on the stove for a few minutes).  I would spend some time sourcing good quality frozen meals you might feel comfortable eating, or maybe some pre-made soup, that is a bit more nutritious than something like frozen chicken tenders so that you eat those and still get some nutrition until you have the means to work on solving the issue. Hope things get better for you.",False,False

I don’t have any advice but you aren’t alone as I have the same thought patterns about poisoning and stuff, it’s probably part of why my ed started. I hope it gets better for you as it’s a mental hell :(",False,False

It could be a step to ease the amount of time spent getting food and an intermediary between buying ready meals and making food.  I hope things get better for you",False,False
