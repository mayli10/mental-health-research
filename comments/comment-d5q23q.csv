Iâ€™m skeptical because I have been trying to lose weight for almost a solid year and only gained slowly.",False,False

I don't trust my scale either but when I bought a new one, I was the same weight. I second what someone else said, the batteries might need to be replaced. And personally I'm super cheap so I'd try verifying at like a friend's house or something before I bought a new scale.   You could also test it with something extra you know the weight of (eg; when you step on the scale holding a 10 lb weight, does it go up 10 lbs?)",False,False
