This might solve the problem short-term and avoid the guilt of throwing them away  As for the long term, I like what another poster suggested - limit yourself to one challenge at a time. If you eat it, you get to buy another.",False,False

Instead of buying a lot of things at once, pick one and challenge yourself to keep it in your house and eat it. Next week you do the same for something different. Rinse and repeat",False,False
