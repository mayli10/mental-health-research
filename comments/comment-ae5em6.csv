Can’t do that with MyFitnessPal. Also If I eat something with X amount of calcium in it, when I create a new food entry on MyFitnessPal, I should be able to enter in how many milligrams of calcium it was, instead of some percentage relative to the recommended amount (based on guidelines, which vary by country).  Finally, it would be nice if you could change the formula they use to calculate projected weight loss, because although I’m sedentary, my TDEE is **not** BMR x 1.2 – it’s more like BMR x 1.1, according to this calculator (the most accurate I’ve *ever* found): https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/",False,False

You can still create custom foods (I do it when my phone won't let me take photos) but it means there is far less bullshit in the database.  It also doesn't give a shit about how many calories you eat. It gave me the suggestion of 457 calories a day to lose 2lbs a week and was just like ""...we good?""     What I want though, is a way to hide macro goals.

I don't have consistent scheduling and I can't even be like ""on Tuesdays, we restrict"" lol or something like that. I also want to be graded within a RANGE of numbers. So if my goal is 1500, I want to be able to say a +/- range of, say, 200 would be fine (so 1300 to 1700).  I actually just mainly use my calorie tracker as a food diary, so I'd actually kill for an option that lets me log the grams/volume of food and then hide the calorie counts. (Look at ya girl trying to recover but also kind of not because she'll delete her life before she deletes her tracker!!!)  And then, for recipes, idk if other places have this capability, but I want to just save the list of ingredients without numbers attached, and then when I pick that recipe next, I can input how much of each item I used. It's a pain to recreate intricate recipes every time I batch cook because I wanted to use more rice, or less potatoes, this time around, or I ran out of an item. To be able to tap a recipe, and then manually input how many grams of rice I used *this* time would be a dream.",False,False

I would add a feature where the calories slowly trickle in over time instead.  In the morning you may have 400 calories allotted for breakfast for example. Eating more than that makes the calorie count negative, so it takes longer for the calories to bounce back to positive digits and allow you to eat again. And if you overeat one day, the debt and negative calories from that day restrict how much you can eat the next day to compensate.  Obviously this *might* be a terrible idea and encourage binge/restrict cycles, so it shouldn't be a default feature at least. But I know it would work for me because I have never struggled with binging from too much restriction. ",False,False
