I feel like I have to prove I'm sick and I feel you on the eating up to 3000cals a day. It makes me feel fake as well,False,False

I feel like I'm faking it for attention.  And I want it to get worse so I can be skinny enough to show my friend.  To say ""yes this is serious, fuck you"", to compete with her, because I feel like she's laughing at me.  But this isn't even the main reason of my disordered behaviours.  Last year was the worst time for my ED, eventually she said something so dumb, that that night I sent her a 4 page google doc ""confessing"" about how I've felt the past few months.  And now I eat anywhere from 1200 to 3000 calories, yes 3000.  I feel so ashamed.  Like a complete fake.  The dumb thing she said was ""Once my mom and I got into an argument, and I didn't eat for 2 days, all I had were eggs"".   Arguments and stress and anxiety can all completely diminish your appetite, just because you don't have an appetite for 2 days doesn't mean you suddenly have an eating disorder.  Or maybe I'm wrong.  But it pissed me off so bad, she constantly self diagnoses, which isn't horrible because it does lead people to get help, but this girl.  It doesn't help but make me feel even more invalid and fake when she said to me ""your ass got fatter over the summer"", which is apparently a good thing, she likes my butt :/",False,False

But it also makes me feel weak that I no longer have that control at keeping it a secret. Self control is the main root of my ED.,False,False

However, I definitely don’t feel I’m that good at having an ED in another aspect. I live with my bf and we’re very honest with each other. I sometimes wish I could come up with better excuses to not eat so I could be even stricter with my calorie restrictions like I am when he’s away on work trips. Or even with other ppl in social situations...I wish I didn’t want to appear normal to them and I could come up with better excuses to not eat even a little of what they’re having at dinner.",False,False

I’ve been finding it so fucking hard to fast, and more often or not I give in before my end goal, and I feel I eat more after finishing a fast than when I do when restricting, so I think I need to just high restrict every day.  But then I feel if I don’t fast, I don’t have an eating disorder and I have no business considering getting help or anything like that. Because I am eating every day, so what’s the problem? Why am I trying to pretend I have an issue? I’ll probably be laughed at if I think I have an ED when I’m deciding to mostly eat every day now.   So your post resonates with me 100%",False,False
