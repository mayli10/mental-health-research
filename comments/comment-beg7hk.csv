I am on disability and i can afford one meal a day or ~$2/day. I have been having to put more towards gas because i take my mans to work so i only eat when he does. In my head he is more important because he works so if we have $5 for food it should go towards him.,False,False

I was too stubborn to go to the food bank bc ""there are other people who have it worse"" as if I wasn't stretching a 5-portion batch of rice and beans over 2 weeks and regularly pulling 72 hour water fasts because I literally had no money and just wanted to feel like I had SOME control over my falling-apart life.   Now that I have my finances sorted out, I still struggle with this mentality tho. I made 5 stuffed peppers for dinners for the week. Froze 2 ""oh, in case it gets tight near the end of my paycheck"" (it won't, I have built up my savings) I cooked them all up on and ate 1/2 one in sunday, and then did a 48 fast. I still have 3 1/2 left and I'm thinking abt starting another 48 hour fast tonight so I can really stretch these out and don't have to go grocery shopping again for a while and I hate it!! I have enough money I could be eating 6 whole stuffed peppers a day and still not make a dent in a normal person's grocery budget!! And I'd still be waaay below my TDEE but for some reason my dumb brain thinks this is the smarter way ughhh.",False,False
