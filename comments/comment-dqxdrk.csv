You deserve to not have thoughts about food or your weight be such a source of stress. You deserve to be able to devote more energy to the people/causes that you care about, rather than spending said time on ED-related behaviors.  And while the journey to get out of this funhouse mirror maze of the mind may be shitty and you smack into some mirrors by mistake, hopefully the shitposts on here can give you some reprieve along the way.",False,False

You sound like a really empathetic person to be so concerned with how your actions are affecting other people. Best of luck!  The fact that I'm on this sub indicates that I haven't got this all even close to figured out, but what you wrote made me think of something: I think a good amount of people know the actions to take to get to a better state of mind, but that doesn't necessarily translate to any sort of change. In that realm, it can be endlessly frustrating to know the simple rules that one should follow and then be unable to consistently execute said rules. But maybe it isn't just about knowing where you need to go, but also about knowing the roadblocks that have stopped you so far.   We all got in our current situations because these were the most effective coping mechanisms we had to deal with the circumstances/ problems of our lives. It got us into some shit, but our past selves were doing the best they could with what they had. Now that we know this isn't working and that there are better options, it's our job to (slowly, painfully, arduously) change our habits and responses so our future selves can worry about other things.  Idk, sorry for rambling. I hope it was helpful to someone other than me. A point to think on to promote long-term mental health.  Edit: forgot the main point of this message, which was to cheer you on. :P",False,False
