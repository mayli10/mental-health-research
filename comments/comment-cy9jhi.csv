They have this Drive option where you buy online in advance so you don't have to enter the shop. I always thought that this was more expensive than going to Lidl simply because the shop itself is more expensive. But I have to face the fact that wasting 40-60‚Ç¨ a week on binge food is always more expensive than any other shop...  I have no control around food so until I do I am not entering a shop üòÅ,False,True
