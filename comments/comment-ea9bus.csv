And I am sorry this happened to you because that guy was way way out of line.   &amp;#x200B;  I sometimes find though that those kind of mistruths about metabolism are some of the things that scare people out of trying to recover. ie ""I've damaged my metabolism now, if I eat a 'normal' amount I will gain so much more because of it, I can only stay small if I eat 700 cals now."" when that's not true. I wasn't trying to target you and thought you'd gotten a lot of support from other people.",False,False
