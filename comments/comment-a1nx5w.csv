The food has to be something with one ingredient.  For example, eggs, potatoes, chocolate. It can't contain any wafers, fillings, etc. A lot of people do eggs or potatoes or fruits. And surprisingly,  many people do chocolate. You don't have to count calories when doing mono diets, just grams. Its speculated that your body acts as if its fasting when you eat only one thing for a  short period of time (at least for me it does). Something else to do with your body not being able to process only one thing? Not really sure but this is the third time I've done a chocolate mono and it never let's me down. A lot people get sick from all the chocolate.  Not me. I love chocolate and it helps me get rid of the cravings every once in awhile. I've only done Hershey's kisses and m&amp;ms. I also only choose dark chocolate because its healthier. People say not to do m&amp;ms because of the crunchy outer layer but others  say it's no big deal because the outer layer melts. I've had no problems with it.",False,True

Before, I was low restricting and was scared to eat more because of the inevitable food weight I would gain. I gained on Thanksgiving anyways and it gave me the push I needed to stop low restricting and start eating more (still restricting, I just don't almost pass out every day now) and that has helped me stop binging :)",False,False
