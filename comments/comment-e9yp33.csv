The doc said something like it should take minimum 30 hours to go through the body because of the intestines but I mean... that's not my experience, doc!",False,True

This is the only site I go to for disordered eating because I don't want to get too obsessed reading evertyhing. lol.  Weird that my cursory google search showed nothing but it is common in fasting forums.  Thanks for the info!,False,True

I think it has to do with hella fasting...i guess why ur doc says its impossible for someone on a normal diet. I think normal intestinal transit time is like 24-36 hours. It does seem weird that it would happen that fast but its like ur body is expunging everything, not digesting it normally, thats how it feels for me after a long fast.",False,False

When I fast multiple days, when I eat it barely digests, it just goes right through me. If you visit the fasting forums, you'll see that it's very common.  Usually within an hour or two, I'm in the bathroom after eating. But that's only after fasting multiple days. Hugs.",False,False
