We all look like super models carved out of stone or fat bastards like me haha. I'm 5ft 11in 333lb ex national athlete, and she's 115lb and gorgeous. Between the way it is here and the fact that the grocery stores are run down and too expensive it fucks everyone's diet up haha we all usually eat at the local deli or pizzeria. Obviously we cook at home but it cost more to make it at home.",False,False

And don't go with the Canadian guidelines, which are rather low. The government recommends 600 UI a day for people up to 70 y.o., but researchers at UofT recommend 2,000 UI for white Canadians, higher for non-white Canadians (because our darker skin colour/tone makes the absorption harder).",False,False

One day it’s super hot to the point that you’re sweating, the next it’s raining, the next it’s cold asf, then it’s in the negatives. Like bruh if we could make up our mind so that I can make an exercise plan for a week at a time that would be great!!!   Also, I’m fairly certain everyone anywhere could relate to this, but as someone who lives in a shitty town : the sidewalks are either shit in some areas or non existential in others and I hate walking / biking in the road :(",False,False

I’m probably moving soon though. I do feel like living where it’s normal to wear very little clothing and be outside a lot has motivated my fitness and weight loss over the years. I’ve spent a lot of time trying to look super fit and tan and skinny.  I’ve gone to the beach many times with an empty stomach and came home late in the day feeling so sick from the heat and hunger - almost delirious feeling. But it’s also nice to live somewhere where outdoor activities are always available as is a lot of healthy food and yoga and people into those things. But I find a lot of the “wellness” is really just to look good not actually feel good.,False,False

Nearly everything my mom cooks is fried or greasy. I don’t live there anymore but I visit enough and just never eat because it genuinely makes me sick since I haven’t eaten that way in a near five or six years. My town is no longer small and is pretty much a small city so we have fast food places out the wazoo and don’t forget about our signature sweet tea FULL of sugar.  The weather is abysmal. The summers average 100+ degrees and the humidity gets worse every year. In spring our weather is rainy and dangerous, plenty of tornadoes and severe storms come through. Winters are far too cold, the only good time is fall.   Due to all of these things, I worm out at a gym or at home.",False,False
