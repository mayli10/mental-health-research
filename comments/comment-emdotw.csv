That eating disorders are not the original issue if you will that needs to be addressed. I think there are things behind ED that drive ED. I have stopped ED behaviors before and ended up drinking a lot. Quit the drinking and I cut. Stop cutting and I exercise manically then rotate back to ED. All those things are not my real issue. I am in therapy to deal with these maladaptive behaviors K have that stem from trauma in my past. And most of the people I know with maladaptive behaviors have some kind of other issue that drives the behaviors.,False,False
