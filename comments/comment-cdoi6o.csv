In all of the places I've been treatment, there's only one that I felt focused on weight and body image the appropriate amount, which in reality, is not much at all. There were spaces to process you're feelings about that, sure, and if you were underweight you were expected to gain (at a reasonable weight with reasonable meals). Instead they focused on everything else: relationships and how you interact with them, how you interact with yourself, trauma and how it affects your view of the world and self, how you process stress, etc. Otherwise everyone else just wanted me to gain, gain, gain fast and almost nothing else.   I've often thought it unfortunate that being underweight is such a loud symptom everyone focuses on when the more pressing issues lie elsewhere.",False,True

I hate how treatment is all about gaining weight instead of *curing our fucking brains* first.  I seriously think it pushes relapse rates up. It makes us give up on treatment early. And they always talk about it like it's just some choice and not a symptom of a life-ruining mental disorder.  Will think of you while I scream at the moon tonight.,False,False
