They pretend it never happened, or act like I'm the one that's out of hand. Or they will double down... for example, I say to stop making comments about X. They will go on and on about how X is true. Just look and see!  Ridiculous.   One person has responded positively to my boundaries. The rest act offended.",False,True

I remember Christmas Day when I was maybe 16. I started coming downstairs and the family friend saw me and SHOUTED “hey fatty!” I laughed it off and pretended I forgot something upstairs but I was bawling in my room for a good half hour. I heard him when he saw my sister and he said “hey skinny!” That was 16 years ago and the memory makes my whole body cold.   Have you ever thought about confronting the people who hurt you?,False,False
