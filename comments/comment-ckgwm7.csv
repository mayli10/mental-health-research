You get to your goal and it's not what you expected, so you make a new goal, a lower one. And it continues until you're either very sick or lose control entirely.   As hard as it is to just give up on a goal, it's important to understand that the way you see your body isn't going to change depending on the number you see on the scale. It can only change once you purposely try to love yourself as you are now. I know, heard it all before but there is no happiness obtained from the results of an eating disorder. Only ever misery.  Every time I've lost weight and hit my goal it got lower and lower until I got extremely ill. Stay safe, don't let the illness beat you if you can help it.",False,False
