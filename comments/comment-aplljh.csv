I bet you’d find some just by googling about leaner/slimmer thighs. And you can also try running. I do know to avoid weights though, as those will increase muscle mass. And there are also butt lift exercises on YouTube which don’t use weights so those may help you for that.",False,False

I genuinely always thought I'd be happy at my ultimate goal weight. Now all I see are further problem areas. I used to think, so long as i was underweight, I'd feel comfortable with my body. Now underweight seems like no big deal. I feel like my weight could balloon at any moment, that I should get severely underweight so that there's plenty of buffer room there should I happen to put on 10lbs overnight....  But I can't let myself think like that. I want to be thin but athletic. Graceful but strong. I don't want my hair to fall out. I don't want to develop those weird face creases you see on extreme anorexics. I want a bum (I've already lost my bum tbh. RIP). My dream body does not look anorexic. I want to have the energy and strength to be a great ballet dancer. The mental clarity to thrive in academia. I have to fight against the urge to lose more weight before this eating disorder robs me of all my hopes and aspirations and life. ",False,True

I guess the problem is that I really want to rid myself of the obsession with calories. To just take a break from counting. I know exactly how many calories I've consumed every day for the past two months. I'm sick of the number-anxiety. I realise that not counting may result in me under or over-eating, because my hunger cues are so messed up, as you say. That's why I'm only giving myself a limited window to try this intuitive eating, because I figure I can't do too much damage in five days. At the end I'll check my weight again and if I've dropped weight still I know I need to push my calories up, start putting peanut butter on everything, I don't know, and if I've gained... well, tbh, if its just a few pounds I think that's fine. I don't know what I'll do after that though. The desire to lose the weight I've gained again will be strong. ",False,True

It took a lot just to reach a place where eating to maintenance was just normal for me, but I've been stressed out lately and last night I was looking at my legs and felt the same way. I doesn't matter that my thighs are literally thinner than they ever have been, I just don't feel that I'm good enough. I get a little more stressed out than usual and suddenly I'm not thin enough. I'm still trying to experiment with gaining weight, but it's so hard. I hope your date goes well. Good luck with everything.",False,False

It is really not appropriate to use intuitive eating as a tool and method coming right out of restriction — it (being the actually developed process) wasn't made for that and can cause issues, especially for people prone to binge eating or medical loss of appetite. Medical recovery programs count calories for you until you are no longer starving and experience hunger and eating in a less disordered way — extreme hunger, loss of appetite, binge and restrict episodes mostly over. Your body has lost touch with its natural impulses because of restriction, and trying to eat intuitively on a whim may be very difficult and discouraging.  1000 is great. I recommend finding that maintenance number and gently increasing what amount of that you're aiming for — half, two thirds, three fourths, etc, until you can be at maintenance properly.  That said, I urge you to also enjoy special occasion meals without fear, which may mean not counting at all and accepting/honoring the reality that one meal is not going to drastically alter your body or your mindset, and that human beings have used food to engage with one another socially for thousands of years.
