How many people could get over their heroin addiction shooting up a small dose once a day to stay alive? How many pack-or-more a day smokers could kick smoking if they had to smoke 3 cigarettes, no more and no less, every day? You know what I mean?   BED is such a bitch because there's just no getting away from food. It's not like you can move out of the bad neighborhood with the food dealers and try to turn your life around. You know?",False,False

Now, I have a different ED, so my experience might not relate. However, I did spend 19years of my life taking care of my dad before his heroin addiction finally killed him. I'm going to talk about it for a second here because I've noticed a lot of similarities between him and me. His addiction was just different from ours--we are addicted in some capacity to our behaviors around food, be it eating too much, too little, purging, or what have you. We are all addicts in our own way and that's why I think sharing this is going to be helpful.   He described feelings of being out of control, stressed out, anxious, depressed, and frustrated as being some of his main triggers. The way heroin works (at least as I understand it) is it forces your brain to produce HELLA dopamine and makes you feel good, safe, secure. He said it felt like soft bunny hands were cradling you and whatever void in your soul felt gone. You just had this incredible feeling of being ok. This might be totally bonkers, but I imagine that's what it's like to be in the womb y'know? You feel like everything is good, all of your needs are taken care of, nothing is stressing you out, and you feel safe.   I have all of those same triggers that he had. When I get stressed or anxious or depressed or I just feel like everything in my life is unstable, that's when my ED manifests. I get that control over myself, I get the pride (and then obviously I shatter it when I realize how pathetic I am but y'know), I get a sense of comfort when I do give in and just eat. From my ED, I get all of these things that make me feel a bit safer, a bit more secure, a bit more loved even. I'm chasing all the same things my dad was, but he found it through heroin while I found it in food.   Out of the people that try to give up heroin, 2% are successful. it's a drug that follows you around your entire life. I'm not saying that you shouldn't try to quit if that's something you're dealing with, it's definitely worth it to be in that 2%, but I'm bringing it up to show how incredibly difficult it is. The process is painful (ever hear of being dope sick?), Sometimes it's expensive, and at the end of it all, your brain is always going to remember that it can make itself happy again by using. Your brain will never forget it. That's why it's so hard to give up even if you're already clean.   For EDs, I think we do the same thing. Our brains will never forget how much easier it feels to restrict/BP/binge/etc. Our brains will always know what it can get out of performing ED behaviors. That avenue will always be an option according to our brains. It's up to us to say ""no"".   In the clinics and groups and programs that ive taken my dad to, the number one recommendation they make is ""people, places, things"". If there are certain people that make you want to use or that are around that lifestyle and not trying to get out of it, stay away from them. Cut them outta your life. If there are certain places where you are more likely to use, don't go there or at least don't be there alone. If there are certain things that trigger you to want to use, don't be around them alone. He never took that advice and I think that made his struggle harder.   For me, I think that advice is actually pretty good. For one thing, there are certain subs that I look at to trigger myself. That's bad and I shouldn't do that. Also, my mom played a big part in me developing the ED to begin with; I have pretty much cut her out of my life to save myself. Getting away from me with another example, let's say someone is more likely to binge when they are home alone. I'm not saying it's easy or the one solution, but avoid being home alone then. Take away the options you have to engage with your ED by taking away the triggers and comfort zones that allow you or encourage you to take part in your ED. Get away from the people, places, and things that trigger you.   Also, like addicts, we can only take things one day at a time. I can't promise I won't relapse tomorrow. Or next week. Or next year. I can't say that I havent relapsed before. All I can do is try not to relapse today. If it happens, it happens but then I'll wake up the next day and do the same thing: just try not to relapse that day. Obviously I'm not the pinnacle of recovery, but at least getting away from my triggers got me to a) stop acting like my ED was normal b) made me notice when I was doing ED shit and c) got me to stop doing it like it was second nature or a daily habit.   Now, OP, I know food is always around and out there. But your triggers are not everywhere. So I ask that you sit down and really think about what's happening in your life when you binge. Did you see that one person that always makes you feel fat or like your life is out of control? Did you go to that one place where it feels like everyone is judging you? Etc. Engage with that dialogue and you might find that it's easier to say ""I don't have to do this, I can just stop talking to that jerk, Doug"" or whatever.",False,False

I can't escape it when I need it to survive. 🥺 I fast and all the while food consumes my thoughts, both my love and my enemy. The highlight of most of my days and comfort, even though shortlived. It doesn't help that events and get togethers surround it and even travel. You just can't get away from it and it is a nightmare. If I could become indifferent to it as some people, I would choose it, just to have some resemblance of self control, even though it is such a huge passion of mine, an obsession. People think I am the one with self control becauae I don't eat breakfast or lunch at work and little do they know that they are the ones with real control. Calories and food scare me and I can't trust myself, even though it's vital to life. No I can't just have a little this or that. Once I start, I can hardly get myself to stop, even when my stomach is bursting and shame creeps in, after it's far too late.

I left a family that controlled every second of my life, I fought to get an emergency passport in a third world country behind my family's backs to be able to leave.

I hate hating myself, it's so tiring. I hate hating the way I look, it isn't fair. I've been through so fucking much I should be able to look in the mirror without it destroying my self esteem.

Talking about the hurt is better than acting on the hurt.     BED might seem like the odd one out in the ED family tree, but it is one of the most common EDs out of them all. I am sorry that you seem to be in a rough patch with it right now. It definitely isn't talked about as much in the media, which needs to change, but it is just as devastating as any other ED. One thing to always remember is that an ED is a mental disorder. EDs extremity isn't determined by weight, but by mental health. We are all sick mentally, but the adverse effects show physically. There is no glamor in binging 3000 calories worth of food, in nearly fainting due to starving, in sitting next to a toilet to get rid of a previous meal. No glamor, but we all do it.
