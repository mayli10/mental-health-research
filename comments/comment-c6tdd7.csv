I hesitate to say this because we really have  cliche of ""throw the whole SO out"" type of thing going on here, but what he did is so not okay. Going behind your back, using you to brag online? For me, that'd be highly shitty already, add the fact he *knew* about your BDD, that's just twisted. This wasn't something done out of ignorance of EDs, this was just plain rude and demeaning. I know it's super hypocritical of me to say, but he ain't worth the pain you're putting yourself through. Please take care in whatever way you can ❤❤",False,False

Nobody has thick legs at 114 pounds, wtf. And he prefers you at 110? That’s two pounds from underweight. He wants you to be as thin as possible and bordering on medically underweight? Fuck that.
