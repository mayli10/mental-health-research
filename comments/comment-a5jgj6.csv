I believe that my mom had disordered eating issues when I was younger (looking back)  and she lost weight last year after gaining a bit and is a healthy weight now but went on and on about how she was starving and calories etc. Same thing with my cousin.   I am always scared I will affect my siblings, students, friends with my disorder. I would never wish this upon anyone EVER and just want to protect them. They are all perfect, I am messed up. I fear my actions may encourage others to act the same. I hate if that were to ever become a reality. idk how to even fix it. People always complain about their bodies or say oh I need to diet etc. and every time a wave of anxiety goes over me and I just want to scream ""no, you are beautiful and healthy and I love you!""",False,False

I have one friend who's a notoriously picky eater and eats like a child. But I don't think it's about habits, but rather the anxiety, fear, fixation, or compulsion that drives our habits. A part of me thinks that if I can't treat myself well and be happy, at least give me the strength and healthy coping mechanisms to eat garbage and be happy like my friends do. There was a time when I could do both of these things, and I miss that time very much. ",False,False

It’s part of our culture, honestly.  People with full-blown eating disorders make up 3% of the population in the US, and that’s probably underreported.  That’s 50% more than there are Jews in the US.  I meet other Jewish people all the time, it feels like a lot - so I’m likely coming across even more people with an ED.",False,False

I think disordered eating is extremely common nowadays, just based on what I've witnessed with others. People can binge on occasion and not have BED. Or over-restrict without having AN. I think it's the degree to which it affects you, as well as how many additional symptoms that determine whether it's a disorder.",False,False
