When I went on a trip with my ex for like 3-4 days I ate three meals a day, no purging, no exercising, nothing, because it was the right thing to do to not ruin a good memory for us. After the next week home everything had settled back to normal and it actually helped kickstart my metabolism again. Even though it was hard I powered through it and Iâ€™m so grateful for that. I got to have carmelized banana pancakes guilt free(ish) because of this special occasion! Itâ€™s really good for both of you for you to cut yourself some slack right now, I promise you will be okay and it wonâ€™t last",False,False
