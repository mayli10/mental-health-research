I gained 30 lbs this year due to a hormonal complication. I have my hormones managed now, but I’m still left with the weight. I’ve been recovered for awhile, but I need to lose this weight. I want to rapidly lose weight, but I know that isn’t safe, and I don’t want to trigger an Ed again. It’s hard to lose weight and easier to just not try, but I learned that you need to be more gentle with yourself. Understand why you gained weight, accept it, and make changes to make yourself healthier. It’s like losing weight to get to a healthier state just as we once had to gain weight to be healthier. It’s difficult. I don’t have the answer. Just know you aren’t alone",False,False
