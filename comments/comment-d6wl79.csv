I don't know what happened to Brittany. Rumor has it that she passed away from a heroin overdose. If that's true, it breaks my heart. Like many others have said, she really resonated with me, too.  Alisa is doing better. She got another degree and works for Acadia Health to try to help others with EDs find treatment.  I don't know anything about Jen. Her last name was never revealed.",False,False

No romanticizing, no sugar-coating, just reality.   I watched it while I was at rock bottom, so it was immensely triggering at the time.  The way I saw the staff treat the patients scared me away from checking into residential, which was what my treatment team had recommended for me at my initial intake assessment at a treatment center. We settled upon their PHP program knowing that residential was the better option, and I've always wondered if my treatment would had fared differently if I went that route first.  I wish I had known at the time that not all residential programs are like Renfrew, and that there could have been some great staff at the place during filiming that just weren't on camera. My gut feeling is that the worst ones were those who *wanted* to be on camera for attention.",False,False

Brittany was the person who really resonated with me - and at 25 I think I've carried that through with me to the present day.",False,False

I really related to the woman who had children (I have a 15 month old) and seeing how her disorder effected her relationship with them really hit home for me &amp; made me realize I do actually want to recover one day. If you are feeling vulnerable or sensitive to potential triggers I would recommend not watching the film.,False,True
