I understand where you are coming from, and also I think you could have stated it in a much more supportive way.    “Don’t try and pretend it’s for a noble reason”  I don’t get any vibe whatsoever from this person that they think suicide is a noble act. No where did they state that by killing themselves they would be a hero, or praised for it. All they said is that it would be a relief to their family. That’s not nobility, that’s just them describing how they see the situation and how they think it would affect the people around them",False,False

A very fortunate person wrote the first comment.   Some people want to die but not right now, or maybe they haven't decided, or maybe they're scared, and expressing that feeling to those who might listen and care is pretty common for suicidal people. We all want to feel like someone cares and we all need to get it off our chest sometimes. Not suck it up and die the moment the thought crosses our mind.",False,False

Expressing suicidal ideation is a cry for help, a sign that part of the person actually wants to live. Unless OP is completely paralyzed or in an institution  there’s nothing preventing them from committing suicide besides their own will to live.   And as someone who has been suicidal and depressed and has survived loved ones who have committed suicide, suicide is absolutely selfish. I understand how you can convince yourself that things will be better off once you’re dead but that is absolutely untrue. I’m a stranger, I don’t know OP and I’m not capable of missing them but I believe their life has inherent value which is why I’m not going to agree with the lies they tell themself.",False,False

You know there’s no worse heartbreak than a parent losing a child, right?  If you’re going to have suicidal ideation, don’t try and pretend it’s for a noble reason like relieving other people of the burden that is you. Suicide is always selfish, it’s to relieve your own pain.   Anyway if you really wanted to die, you’d just do it instead of posting about it in the internet. Sorry you’re feeling this much pain right now but killing your self isn’t the only available option to stop it. You don’t have to use your body to reflect how you feel. You have a mouth, and you have people who love you who you can tell about your pain. Don’t pursue a permanent solution to a temporary problem. You really going to opt out of life while everyone else struggles to make do with what they got?",False,False
