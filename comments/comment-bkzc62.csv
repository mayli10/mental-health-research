You could explain that you already know your current weight and you know you won't qualify for ED treatment and if they weigh you it will just make you feel worse. Then they can just treat you for the cough.,False,False

I wish I was more familiar with your system to give advice.,False,False

It’s weird that they would even have weight as a guideline because apparently they treat all kinds of eating disorders but it feels like the guidelines are specific for something like anorexia or restrictive eating disorders,False,True
