It used to feel so powerful and exciting! And/but the time I’ve been most “successful” in restricting was the time I got most excited about it again. I used to wake up in the morning excited to eat two hard-boiled egg whites with hot sauce bc I felt proud and powerful for eating that little,False,False

I always thought this ana-stuff goes to far, but I googled it anyway, I watched videos on Youtube, had my own blog about it, chatted with other girls with ED... My ED started 12 years ago and sometimes (7th to 9th grade) I pretended to be sick to stay at home and google weight loss tips all day. I had so many rules and it was almost fun exploring them and to follow them, because it felt like this was my mission.",False,False
