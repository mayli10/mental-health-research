Now I still experience pain somewhat? Sort of? But it's more of a general hollow feeling than anything disruptive ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ You can try severely restricting for a month straight like I did (≤800cal/day and running 3+ miles when I could fit it in my schedule) and while it was successful I'm not super sure I can accomplish something like that again--I got headaches like crazy and felt like I was going to blackout when I stood up. And restricting anywhere near that now (≤1200cal/day--my BMR is around 1500-1600/day) for longer than a day gives me the same result even without bothering to run, so the best I can manage now is ignore the progressive nausea/wilting feeling and stick with OMAD where the meal focuses on volume than calorie amount and that works! I don't really feel pangs or progressive nausea after that or anything, and it's rad.",False,False

Hunger pangs=/= hunger.  Although, actual hunger eventually got to the point where I would only experience it at my usual dinner time. But after 2 years of failed fasting attempts, I think my body is more ketone-adapted because that has kind of dissipated more recently as well, with the addition of sporadic 48+ fasts.  That said though, it's useless if I can't refrain from BED -_- I experience way too much psychological hunger smh. Though it is nice because I still used to get hungry after a binge day at my planned meal times, but because my body isn't accustomed to getting food at this meal times anymore, it's really easy for me to restrict post-binge now because I actually am stuffed and don't experience this hunger. I've been bingeing for three days straight, and yesterday I actually, genuinely forgot to eat for the first time in my life lol. I don't think that would happen if I restricted for three days straight though lol",False,False

I guess I really should just stick to it better. I was listening to an OMAD podcast and the ladies on it said that the hunger doesn't go away and that it just becomes more manageable. But maybe if I'm stricter about it I'll be able to get similar results to you.,False,True

But yea i don't experience hunger pangs. My stomach growls and i can feel when my stomach is ""empty"", but it doesn't motivate me to eat. I've always considered hunger to be mental... Like I used to unintentionally fast all day because I was too lazy to make myself breakfast or lunch to bring to school and didn't have money to pay for school food, so as soon as i got home i would immediately snack. If I was used to eating a certain amount, I would want to eat that amount and thoughts about food wouldn't go away until I entertained them (and I was never one to turn down food or the idea of food pre-ED). When I started fasting though, my compulsions stopped because mentally I had already decided I wasn't going to eat and I had no expectations or anticipation. It's all mental for me really. I get cravings but I don't get hungry. When I get cravings it's all a matter of not entertaining the thought and just acknowledging that the craving is there, and then I don't feel the compulsion to satisfy my craving. And if I'm fasting/restricting (I say restricting because social/family dining isn't always avoidable) for an extended period of time, the compulsions completely go away",False,False
