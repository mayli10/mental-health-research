I was seriously underweight (like BMI of 13 and dropping) and could no longer eat solid food. My parents never said anything or tried to make sure I was okay. So I finally was like ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm dying because I can no longer even walk to the kitchen to get water without passing out and haven‚Äôt eaten solid food in a month. I made a consultation appointment at the local eating disorder clinic.‚Äù   My mom‚Äôs response ‚Äúmaybe they‚Äôll tell you you‚Äôre fine and you can just go home!‚Äù  Great mom. That‚Äôs super helpful. She didn‚Äôt have anything to say when the eating disorder center said they had a 5 month waiting list but made room to get me into treatment the next day because it was an emergency.   She‚Äôs never been capable of being there when I was struggling. I could never tell her anything because it ‚Äústresses her out‚Äù and then my abusive dad would punish me for upsetting her. If I told her something in confidence, like about my dad being abusive, she would pretty much immediately tell him. I love my mom, but she was pretty fucking terrible at supporting and protecting me.",False,False
