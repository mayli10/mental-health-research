People compliment me and say how jealous they are and say things like ""what are you a size 2?""

And I think psychologist are quite powerful with what they do and do not say.  Dear OP, I hope you can work on your issues in therapy üíï. I‚Äôm doing better now, in fact I‚Äôll obtain my masters degree in psychology in a few weeks :) - experiencing this as a young adult was a drag but so valuable to use in practice",False,False
