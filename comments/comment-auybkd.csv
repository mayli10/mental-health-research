She doesn't blame you at all. You gave her the best life you could have, and you were her friend, and that's all she ever wanted. She still loves you.  I lost a dear, dear friend recently too. If talking would help, please feel free to PM me.   The silence after is the worst. You can sit in it for a while, but it will feel terrible and overwhelming and it'll swallow you up. If you can, try to fill it with happy things, like the songs she liked. She's still listening, she still likes them. And she'll always, always love you.",False,False
