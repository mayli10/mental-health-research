Their experience amounts to ""normie gatekeeping""...that is, when laypeople decide who's allowed to have a real ED, as based on their own medically unsound (and often fatphobic) criteria.",False,False

I've always been a bigger gal, but I've struggled with disordered eating on and off for about 13 years. I only JUST came to terms with it THIS year because I felt like I don't look sick enough. There's no way I have an ED.. because anorexia is always associated with being extremely underweight. That's simply not the case. It took for me to see my best friend struggle with it to finally come to terms with my own struggle. None of my family know. I've only told a few friends. It's awful when you feel like your problems aren't valid because you don't fit the image.",False,False
