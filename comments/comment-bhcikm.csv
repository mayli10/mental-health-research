Like, I'm a dietetics student (I'm fucking terrified for experimental food science classes coming up), my BMI was in the high-overweight range even during my worst of BED (max was 29, and I'm always too scared of getting caught to wear weights to feel like I justify my disorder), and just the whole thing about needing to binge rather than b/p or c/s (I won't even try c/s any more because it's never not resulted in a binge, and my b/p's used to be b/p/b's instead during my previous time with bulimia before Vyvanse just because I have BED thoughts mainly instead of BN).   Idk..just..we're a lot alike ðŸ’• It feels good to not be alone, especially when a lot of the people on ED boards face slightly nuanced issues to us.",False,False

Iâ€™ve had BED for almost 10 years now and Itâ€™s ruining my life, I also contemplated suicide because I couldnâ€™t handle my binge brain anymore. Iâ€™m a culinary arts student/nutrition student and my passion is healthy eating so I feel like an absolute fraud because I binge 5,000+ calories a day and have a terrible fast food addiction. I canâ€™t even c/s or throw up because thatâ€™s how addicted I am to having a full stomach. Iâ€™m not even too sure an appetite suppressant would work on me, thatâ€™s how bad my food addiction is so maybe it is best I didnâ€™t get one prescribed.  I really hope your appointment goes well, getting taken off meds could make some people relapse really bad so I hope they donâ€™t do it to you.  My town has a really bad stimulant/pill problem and I didnâ€™t think my eating disorder would be taken seriously so I contemplated wearing ankle weights with sweatpants at my weigh in to make it look like Iâ€™m worse off than I am even though Iâ€™m a 28 BMI right now but chickened out in fear of getting caught.",False,True

That's very, very odd. The Wellbutrin should/can help your bingeing a lot though.  Vyvanse is my miracle pill, but here's the thing.  1) It doesn't suppress my appetite very much, if at all. It maybe suppressed it for the first week or two, but that's about it. If you want an appetite suppressant, phentermine would work way better for that (I've used both); like, phentermine is 100% appetite suppression and works SO much better than Vyvanse for appetite suppression alone.  2) It doesn't last forever. I get the feeling for several hours a day, every day while it's in my system, but for instance, I can't take it in the morning, otherwise it won't last me at night, so I have to fight tooth and nail on my own in the morning before I can take my dose for the day. At least SSRI's/SNRI's are a lot more long-lasting.  3) It barely helps for bulimia, if at all. I relapsed into bulimia recently, and I can't tell my ED team about it because they would take my prescription away if they found out...I'm currently still more BED than bulimic (though this is the most bulimic I've ever been), and I've found that Vyvanse is essentially useless for bulimia because it does not suppress the urge to binge/purge. Like, it very much works for bingeing, but with binge/purging, I don't know if it's because of the emptiness accompanied by it or the fact that it has no consequences, but the difference for bulimic thoughts when I'm on Vyvanse vs off is very marginal.  That being said, I came to my psychiatrist begging for Vyvanse because BED was ruining my life. Like, I had suffered for 8 years at that point with it, and I honestly was going to kill myself eventually because of it. And yes, I was genuinely overweight at the time because of my BED. I'm not this person who ""only binges because she restricts"", as I developed restrictive and bulimic tendencies after 6 years of BED because I couldn't take BED anymore. BED is my genuine disorder, and if it's yours too, it should fit very well, if you choose to try it.  The only issue from a medical view for me, however, is again, I relapsed into bulimia a few months after taking it. You see, Vyvanse is what kick-started my recovery from BED. Like, I was actually recovering. I was eating three meals a day to the point of satiation, spontaneously losing weight, and it was the most functional and less ED'd period in my life. It was honestly my miracle pill.  The thing is, I had been trying to lose weight for so long during my ED years, that when my weight loss halted, I freaked out. My BMI started at like a 27/28, and eventually tapered off to a 23 one naturally. I don't know why I expected myself to keep naturally dropping until I hit like a healthy-low BMI, but I guess I did. After a few months of this, I couldn't take it, and relapsed into bulimia hard.  I wouldn't say that Vyvanse is the cause of my bulimia, but I would say that Vyvanse worked so well for my BED, that it allows me the freedom to engage in other ED's that I wouldn't be have the ability for if I was taken off of it. Through bulimia/restriction/phentermine use (dangerous to combine two stimulants), I have now dropped to a 19 BMI, and I am fucking terrified of my ED team noticing and taking me off Vyvanse. I have a psych appointment Monday for my Vyvanse, and I'm going to do my best to fake my weight by a good 10 pounds.  It's not that Vyvanse works by cutting my appetite (that's why I use phentermine when I'm not supposed to simultaneously; phentermine cuts it), but it works because it makes the binge voices stop in my head. I feel almost completely free from BED when I'm on it. I think if it was a matter of appetite suppression, phentermine would work for my BED (it helps, but it doesn't stop the thoughts), and of course, I've binged when I'm not hungry way too many times to count. Almost every time, so hundreds.  Anyway, that's good your psych is at least open to it. Not just for the Vyvanse itself, but also because it's good to have an open psychiatrist. I look forward to hearing about your results on your meds.",False,False
