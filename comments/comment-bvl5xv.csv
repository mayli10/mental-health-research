It’s been almost three months since I was on it and I’m still carrying that weight despite CICO. It’s...just wow. This drug should be a last resort regardless of its intended use.,False,False

My doctor says the dose I am on is too low to really have an effect on appetite so I guess that helps. For me, it really helps with anxiety/ocd stuff and sends me off to sleep at night.",False,False

Zyprexa changed my mind. I was put on it like 3 weeks ago and I gained SEVEN pounds in 5 days. I thought it would fall off because it came on so quickly, but it's still fucking here and I'm restricting and purging again to get down to my previous weight. It also made me sleep nearly constantly for the 5 days. That medication was awful for me. 0/10 never recommend.",False,False

I HATE this.   My first psych was an asshole who tried to prescribe it to me without telling me about the side effects... luckily I googled it and when I grilled him about it, he fessed up.   Never took it myself, but some of the other girls I met in treatment did take it. It does typically increase appetite and hunger and that sucks.",False,False

Like, I can understand them wanting to get weight stabilized, but to choose zyprexa specifically because it effs up hunger cues??? Like wtf. That seems like that plan that is gonna majorly backfire. And refusing to address co-occurring issues is pretty silly in my book, since there’s so often a cluster of intertwined things going on that feed the ED mindset.  I mean, working with a psychiatrist is always a delicate balance of self-advocacy and trusting their trained judgement. But after some bad experiences, if I feel like a provider isn’t listening to me I’m pretty inclined to find someone else if at all possible.",False,False
