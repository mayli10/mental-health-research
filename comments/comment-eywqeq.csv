Giving in to the actual and sensible feeling of the need to eat always feels like a binge to me. Heck when I'm at my parents home, eating 3 f.ing balanced meals (still around 2k calories) feels like a non-stop binge to me and at this point ıdk what to do. Not eatint all day to eat (ıdk like 200 calories) feels like a binge and ughh",False,False
