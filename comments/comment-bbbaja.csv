You should look into a medical withdrawal or an incomplete (I can only grant these if more than 50% of the work is done). Attend the class for now until you get this sorted out; it may affect whether or not you can get the incomplete. I'd email the prof; if you don't hear back within a reasonable time frame (like 48 ish hrs) go to the dept head --- do you have an academic advisor? That person should be able to help out too.,False,False

Check your school's final aid dept on the rules for return. I did a medical withdrawl and lo and behold next semester there is a stipulation for me to pay back everything before I could return.   That was 9 years ago...never went back because I flat out could not afford to pay it back and then eventually stopped caring.   Do your research and weigh the pros and cons of each. Best of luck dear!,False,False
