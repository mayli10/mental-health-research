Seeing that you could get to where you are is pretty encouraging, also ngl i think having interaction with someone else about EDs is what I need to really start making changes (leaving my thoughts to myself gets me NOWHERE because ED brain always ends up winning rip) so again, thank you for commenting \^\^ Tbh i think it's acting as a goal list to aim towards... making a start, i'm really gonna try and stop myself from stepping on that goddamn scale 10 times a day LMAO, feel like if i saw the weight trend through the months instead of days it might allow me to eat without worrying about the weight change. I'm also gonna go read up on vitamins RIGHT AWAY",False,True

Firstly i stopped counting calories - which was hard but oh so liberating. I still eat under both my TDEE and 1200 kcals every day so that makes me fine with not counting the exact numbers. I do intermittent fasting and eat a set amount of food every day, mostly breakfast and dinner but sometimes i save some of my breakfast intake for a lunch. I also focus on eating healthy food and fruits or veggies with every meal. This gives me energy to work out because i always have food in me and i find it easier to focus on other things because i know exactly what my next meal will be and what i will eat. I also stopped working out daily and now do it every other day instead to give my body some time to recover and rest because i was starting to get hyrt a lot, and i also feel like that allows me to maximize my workout-effort more because i have more energy to put into it if i’ve had a rest day. I also stopped with my daily weigh-ins and now only weigh myself 1-2 times a month so i don’t stress as much over eventual water weight and fluctuations, and i take vitamins every day, do some reading up and decide what you feel like you want/need!   Not sure if that was what you were looking for but it’s something i’ve found to atleast make this shit somewhat easier to mentally deal with.",False,False
