I have lived almost  this exact situation, the similarities are uncanny, and I seriously consider my decision to leave one of the best decisions I've made in my life. Sometimes when I'm feeling low or bad about myself I just think about what I went through to have the courage to leave that relationship and I get an instant boost of self esteem every time.   &gt;I hate myself more every time that I lay awake the entire night listening to him snore next to m  Yes, this was me exactly. You deserve so much better, there is so much better out there. Your husband has issues that he obviously doesn't want to deal with and they are more important to him than you are. That's not your fault. There are guys out there without those problems and you deserve to be with one of those.  Sounds to me like right now you are internalizing a lot of your anger and imo you need to externalize that anger, get angry! Get angry and hold onto that anger for courage . . . just my 2 cents.",False,False

Open your own account and put money away. Even if you don’t leave him now, get that going for yourself. And a good therapist to support you through the process.   I also wanted to add that it does not matter at all about being a divorce statistic. You will be a much sadder statistic if you continue to stay in such an unhappy situation, and I think it will only get worse. Sorry to say. But none of this is your fault at all.   Look it as you have age on your side instead of being young and divorced. Look it at like you have an opportunity to have some different and better. Go and find yourself!! ",False,False

I think your relationship with a husband is a threat to your health. Nothing shameful about ""being a statistic to divorce"", please don't let this stop you from leaving him.  He also sounds addicted to porn. This is kind of neither here nor there. I've been a camgirl and I'm poly BUT I think emotional connections with ppl online can totally be ""cheating"" if it is tied up in other lies and involves a lot of time investment and if it crosses boundaries that people are acting like they are living up to.  I also think its possible for people to maintain healthy romantic relationships WHILE also viewing cams/porn etc. Everyone is different.   &amp;#x200B;  It isn't a good relationship if someone tells you they are going to be faithful in the ways you want them to be and then be just randomly always talking to people on dating sites.  If you asked for something else and he kept explaining things away he was likely gaslighting you: telling you to ignore your instincts that you were being disrespected and lied to.   &amp;#x200B;  I mean I understand some people hide porn etc from partners and this is what works for them or something but I really feel like a respectful partner should share information about emotional connections willingly.  &amp;#x200B;   I don't believe that he was just ""collecting nudes"" as masturbation aids. I mean even if he was or wasnt... this behaviour isnt WRONG or BAD  but it is shady if he kept explaining it away as ""not really happening""",False,False

You don't deserve any of this.   Yes you are sick and yes you do need therapy. It is important to figure out why you are in the pattern of getting into relationships with unfaithful people who do not value you for who you are, so it can be avoided in the future.

Try not to drink too much it will make ya feel worse in the long run babe!!   Rest up ..get a “migraine” and chill alone ..or get an “urgent work/friend in crisis” call and get out of the house if you prefer  Look I know all that stuff is kinda manipulative but it’s to save your own butt and sanity for the time being until you are calm enough that you can tackle the situation head on ..if that’s u leave..he leaves..or you sort it out together anyhow you will best serve yourself by giving yourself some time to decompress   Look..our mental health /body issues mean that overall many of us need a bit of extra support or help from our partner...and you are just not getting that my dear and that makes it 100000 times harder.   Try to be kind to yourself this has not happened because of your body or weight or size or shape it’s happened because he has a problem and he could be married to anyone and he would still be doing it..I promise it’s not a reflection on you but on him   Take care friend !! ,False,False

You deserve better. Your telling yourself you don’t deserve better is a product of the second issue:  2) You are sick. Your ED and probably some other mental health issues are telling you that the only thing wrong with you is that you are a piece of shit and deserve what you get but that’s your mental illness talking, it’s not the truth. Mental illness can be a seductive, tricky, lying son of a bitch (like your husband).   Please seek out help. Not to save your marriage - that may not be possible.

First, stop telling yourself that you're not sick enough for therapy. You need therapy. Therapy isn't only for people who are sick. Second, stop sugarcoating your husband's behavior. He's cheating and he's going to keep cheating because you allow him to do so. He has absolutely no reason to stop. No repercussions, no consequences. You're not overreacting &amp; you're not crazy. My sister was in the exact same situation.  It doesn't end. It stops when you decide to make it stop. &amp; if that means walking away, so be it. You gaining 25 pounds doesn't not make it okay. If the roles were reversed would he be okay with this? You are at a very vulnerable point right now. Your self esteem is at an all time low &amp; you dont know life without your husband.  Both of these are issues that you will never overcome until you &amp; only you decide to do something about it. I only see two ways in this situation: Stay, and tolerate the cheating. Which will only make you feel how you're feeling now. Or separate, work on yourself as well as your self confidence. Realize that you should have ditched his ass sooner and let time heal you. I am telling you now, it does not matter if you were 50 pounds heavier, covered in acne, and growing a beard, you do not deserve this. Think about that and once you actually do realize it ...which you will, things will get better. ",False,False

I’m so sorry this happened to you. It does seem he cheated on you as it wasn’t just watching porn, it was more intimate like cam girls and actually speaking to people inappropriate which usually unless otherwise stated is a no-go. It’s not your fault, at all. Please don’t let this take you to a dark place. I can suggest you separate (doesn’t have to be legal, just physically), both go to individual and couples therapy, and decide where to go from there. To me this is a huge betrayal, I’m so so sorry.
