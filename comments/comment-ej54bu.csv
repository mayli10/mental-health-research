Yes, I do have work and hobbies, and a wonderful husband. I also have a great therapist. This sudden urge to dive back into the eating disorder took me by surprise. I know I need to talk to my therapist. I have been in this rollercoaster for years. I’m in my 50’s. I have coping skills that work, but panic attacks are something I’m struggling to keep under control. Thanks for the reply. I really appreciate it.",False,True

I feel you on restricting helping with anxiety, that was what triggered my latest relapse that I'm now recovering from. I know it's so hard, but are there any other coping mechanisms you could use? Bc for me, although it really helped at the moment, in hindsight it's really not worth it bc after the initial ""high"" I got so so many health(mental and physical) problems that take so long to fix. If I could go back in time I really really wouldn't do that. You deserve a happy, healthy life! Is there someone you can talk to abt this? Do you have other things (school, hobbies, friends, work) that you can distract yourself with?",False,False
