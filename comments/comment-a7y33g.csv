I guess 10+ years of disordered behavior has me associating fasting with ED and it's hard for me to comprehend how ""health reasons"" isn't a cover for ""disordered behavior"" in any given situation.",False,True

ED is about what’s going on in your head and less about what you are physically doing, so don’t use the fasting as a way to convince yourself you’re just slipping back into another ED (if that’s not true) and commit to more harmful behaviour as a result.",False,False

It's relieving to know someone else gets it but I'm sorry that you are experiencing so much food anxiety too. I'd break it with something small, like a piece of fruit or a veggie, maybe a boiled egg and go easy at Christmas dinner or you might end up spending the night on the toilet. Please don't apologize, we're all in this together. I hope your good mood continues...you got this! ",False,True

It's comforting knowing someone is experiencing literally the same thing but I'm sorry you're having so much food anxiety too :( I think the best thing to do to break it is with something small, like a piece of fruit or vegetable, maybe a boiled egg.

For the last month or so I've been in a bp crase, that slowly turned in to just binging and I felt so fcking lost, out of control, isolated, no motivation, just absolutely awful. Now as I'm fasting I'm feeling greater than ever, having been productive, been walking atleast 10k steps everyday, more social, and just overall in a much better mood. I'm leaving for home tomorrow so I'm building up quite a bit of anxiety about how to break my fast at home safely, and being able to eat christmas meal with my family without alarming them. I completely understand what you're going through, cause I'm just the same rn. It feels like I could go on forever, and the good emotions coming from this, makes us also _want to go on longer. Yet, eating again and perhaps experiencing refeeding syndrome too is a scary af. Really don't want to go back to binging and purging.  Hope your days ahead will be alright too, and know your feelings are not abnormal. It rly do b like that uknow",False,False

I've felt like this...then an injury set me back. A little slip of concentration and vertigo when you've got a #250 barbell on your back? Hello torn rotator cuff and strained hamstring.

I ain't a shrink or a doctor, though.   It would probably be wise to try to find some kind of professional who at least wants to try to understand, though. Because you probably already know this, but fasting is not a quick fix, and building as good a relationship with food as you can is a long game that extends far beyond one fast. ",False,False
