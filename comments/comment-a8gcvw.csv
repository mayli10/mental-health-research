Iâ€™m glad my teeth will look better but damn maybe I have teeth dysmorphia and they went actually bad at all.  ,False,False

I wanted them to hurt! Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s because almost all my teeth are straight. Iâ€™m telling everyone they do though so I can get out of eating stuff.   Downside I had meal prepped a small salad for this weeks dinner and that does hurt my mouth for some reason and I hate wasting food :( ",False,False

Thought about not binging and purging for a day, purged a cookie at work, decided I could start fresh and with hella encouragement from my friend/coworker I kept down lunch even though it fucking hurt for hours and I still threw up stomach acid involuntarily like 5 hours later lolol that was fun. Then I was supposed to have plans but I thought I was getting bailed on so I took myself to get binge food and on my way I got a text like ""hey let me sober up to come get you"" so I just said ""let's reschedule"". I keep doing this, I keep bailing or not hitting people up when I say I will just so I can binge and purge. At this point my ED is like...my #1 hobby. I plan my entire fucking life around this and I can't stop thinking about how boring I am when I'm like this, it's all I think and talk about and do. And now I'm pissed I kept down that food earlier cause my weight is up and I could've avoided that by just fucking purging it and IT'S NOT LIKE ANYONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ANYWAY.   I've completely distanced myself from everyone for the sake of this. I'm blocking out everything that isn't binging and purging. I haven't bought Christmas gifts or called my dad back or seen my friends or HEAVEN FUCKING FORBID TEXTED MY FUCKING FIANCE WHO IS THE PERSON WHO DESERVES MY ATTENTION THE MOST, WAY MORE THAN SHITTY FOOD AND NETFLIX.   God I'm a wreck.",False,False

Been out Christmas shopping for the nieces and nephews. What a nightmare. Finished now tho and going to jump on the treadmill for an hour or so then wrap up some presents. I hope you're well? ,False,False

Iâ€™m not at all good, though, because I decided to order a spicy vegetable deluxe from McDonalds as my treat to myself and they got it wrong (put lettuce in when I asked for none) which has ruined my evening. Iâ€™ve finally calmed down a bit but Iâ€™m still incredibly upset and now feel like I have to control my intake even more even though I didnâ€™t binge at all today, and itâ€™s purely a case of my food being ruined. Ugh.   I think Iâ€™m going to watch a crappy television show before I go to sleep to try lifting my mood slightly.   None of this made sense, Iâ€™m sure. How are you?",False,False

Nervous; Iâ€™m at my motherâ€™s house, and we have a very strained relationship. It rained all day so I couldnâ€™t go on a run, and she doesnâ€™t have exercise equipment. Compensated by restricting, which isnâ€™t healthy, but every time Iâ€™d go to eat, Iâ€™d freeze and tense up. On the bright side, I realized that despite being the same weight as when I started my ED, I have much less body fat and much more muscle. In summary, Iâ€™m just antsy and ready to leave!",False,False
