When we first started dating he tried the standard “why don’t u just eat more???” approach. I’ve explained everything about it to him a bunch of times and he still doesn’t “get it” but he gets it enough to (somewhat) understand.,False,False

Maybe make it a joke and slap his hand away.",False,False

Instead of pressuring me to eat more, he just pressures me to eat better(example: eating real food instead of candy as a meal), and pressures me to not purge.    Tbh it helps more than any other approach anyone has had. He doesn’t comment on how much or how little I eat, the measuring cup used as a bowl, the insane amount of diet drinks. I don’t feel pressured into binging OR restricting. I just do what I feel like.",False,False
