The way I would hope is by talking to you more about these feelings and working with you to overcome them.  But they might also decide that the group isn’t helpful to you and pull you.  I don’t think that would be the wrong decision I just think it’s not necessarily the best decision.  But she might have better judgement than me and know you better, I do tend to stick with things too long at times to my own detriment.  As long as you are receiving other care such as individual counseling it’s probably okay.  If you think the group is helpful and you would like to stick with it and are afraid they will pull you I would do this.  Either when she responds or now send a follow up email saying that your afraid you may have come off wrong in your previous communication and that you don’t want to be pulled from the group but would like if she could help you through some of the feelings you outlined.    If you do get pulled from the group it maybe for the best.  We are not always ready for every step of treatment and comparing yourself to others during recovery can be a dangerous path.  It might be better to get further along and return to a group setting when it is more beneficial to you.",False,False
