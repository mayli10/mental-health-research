I get so tempted to weigh myself during this time and I end up crying every single time. I am that person that gains like 10lbs on their period for no real reason. It just happens and then disappears. Just wait it out. Also restricting heavily makes people gain weight after a while because a body will think it's famine time and it'll save all the calories it gets. Take care and drinking plenty of fluids. ðŸ’•,False,False
