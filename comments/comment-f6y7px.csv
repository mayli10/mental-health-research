I think we should all do our best towards getting better until we are at a point where we can go for a complete recovery. People focus on the physical health aspect a lot and although I do understand why and understand it's immediate importance, mental and emotional health are also very vital for someones well-being and ability to sustain recovery. Stay safe and strong everybody!",False,False
