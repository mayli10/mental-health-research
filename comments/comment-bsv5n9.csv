If you have access to a shower where this is possible, aim the shower head away from you (closer to the drain) so you can sit on the other side of the tub and not scald yourself but still breathe in the steam   Warm water in general is good   If you're in the states, there are cough drops called Cepacol (usually findable at CVS) that have a sugar free version. They are AMAZING. They aren't just ""soothing candy"", they have benzocaine in them to numb your throat.   Benzocaine sprays in general might be good if you can find ones that are unflavored or sugar free.    I hope you feel better soon &lt;3",False,False
