I mean, it has some horrendous side effects (irritability, anxiety, sleeplessness) but wanting to binge? Nada. I also try to save most of my cals until the end of the day when the effects have mostly worn off.    If you’ve taken a lot of adderall in the past or something you could have a much higher tolerance and may need a higher dose.   Hope you find some answers! Good luck :)    ",False,False
