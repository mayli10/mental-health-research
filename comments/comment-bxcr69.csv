When I was maintaining my low weight I was certain I was still healthy when I had the means to make healthy meal choices, but I genuinely feel so much better now, so I think I was wrong in the past when I said some people actually can be healthy while underweight with the right lifestyle. I was doing pretty good for a while until my illness started, but even then it clearly wasn't ideal looking back. I feel better now than I did before which I think is pretty telling. Like, now I just have occassionally crippling pain, but I know a way to manage that which usually works and otherwise I feel a lot healthier.",False,False
