That eating the whole kitchen becomes a habit, and it helps break the habit.  I had similar thoughts yesterday. I reminded myself how I'd feel in the AM if I ate the toaster strudles I wanted to eat. I reminded myself doing so would mess up my morning.  Try to think ""lets look at this logically. My brain is telling me I messed up. Does it make sense to mess up more? Nope."" ",False,False

I'm planning to start CBT in February, but that's for my insomnia. I got better by being mindful of my behaviours, figuring out what the root causes were, and working to move past those issues so I can become a self-actualized person. I'm kind of stuck on executive dysfunction though. I can't seem to figure that one out.",False,False
