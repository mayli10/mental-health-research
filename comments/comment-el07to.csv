A friend of mine sells handmade stuff at markets around the country and when she comes to my town I help her out. Her stuff is good so she always does pretty well even when she has to step out and it's just me, and I had always considered myself to be a pretty charismatic salesperson. I helped make her a decent amount of sales and had some good conversations, even repeat customers from locals who recognise us.  The first time I helped her out since losing weight, my interactions with customers were WAY different. I was having so many fewer awkward or negative interactions. People wanted to talk to me. People were receptive and smiled when I schmoozed them and didn't shuffle off awkwardly, which I'd put down to them just not wanting to buy anything. Which still happened, but I realised a lot of those times... it's because I was just some offputting fat person at the booth they didn't want to be around.  Like, the way I was explicitly treated for being fat always sucked, but I've been fat my whole life - I had no frame of reference for how not-fat people got treated. Now that I'm not as fat any more I'm realising I was getting treated even WORSE than I'd noticed. Like, when people yelled at me from cars for being a ""fatty"" I knew why, but I had no idea that some of the things people did/said to me or the way they reacted to me was because I was fat - it was just how people had always treated *me*. The weird looks people would give me, the awkward ducking-out of conversations, the snippiness, the way my suggestions or jokes or comments would fall flat when the same from other (thinner) people wouldn't. I'd figured I'd done something wrong (which sometimes was true). Or that they were just having a bad day, or were jerks (which was also sometimes true).  But I'm still me. Just thinner. And I'm not treated like that any more. People just don't even realise that they're subconsciously treating fat people worse. Being treated better doesn't make me feel good - it just makes me feel more helpless than before and even more terrified of ever regaining that weight.",False,False
