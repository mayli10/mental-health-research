Maybe try keeping a glass of water so you can drink some when you wake up throughout the night or so you can down it in the morning. This can also happen if you're just dehydrated in general.    Lots of people just don't do well eating in the morning and it suits them much better just to check for dehydration first. :),False,False

But.... I need to feel hungry. In my head hunger=losing weight, therefore satiety=gaining. Which I know is crazy, illogical and not true but alas, my brain is a failure.",False,False
