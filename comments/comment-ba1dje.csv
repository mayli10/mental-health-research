And normally I try to eat one propper meal around 4-6pm (instead of lunch AND dinner), whenever I finish a chapter and think it's a good time to eat (haha). But today I wasn't focused at all, and time passed and then I had to drive my mom somewhere and when I came back it was already 8pm and I thought: It's so late now, I could just continue studying and skip the meal... but then I started cooking and eating and now I feel full and bloated and I regret it... Why can't I just skip a meal without every thought revolving around food until I get up just to shove food down my throat?!",False,False

I just went downstairs for an apple, and through the front window you can see into the kitchen. It's nighttime though, so I can't really see if anyone's there. I heard some soft talking and looked around, then I saw our neighbor (my mom's friend) walk away from the window?! Then when I walked upstairs I saw my mom texting someone in her bedroom. It's just weird. There's a lot I feel adds to the suspicion, like my mom being high and accidentally telling me about a bunch of cameras she failed to install the other night.   I really don't know. I'm in a bad headspace myself and my mom has bipolar disorder and is manic right now. So I just don't know what to think. ",False,False

I need to get my feelings out about it lol   Pros:    - I looked up the menu ahead of time and picked something I've been craving for weeks and a dessert   - I fasted for 24hrs before eating      - I started talking about something I was really passionate about when dessert came so luckily he ate over half of it          Cons:   - he wanted to split appetizers which I hadn't accounted for    - he picked a healthier main than me and it made me feel like... offended?? like he was making a point and suggesting I was eating too much? idk, I know it's not true but ED brain    - some drink pushing and me tryna be like no, a bellini sounds gross, I LOVE water!!!       idk, all in all I'm decently happy with how it went but I should've either switched to a lighter main once we wanted appetizers, or said I was too full for dessert or something. calorically I ate around maintenance up to 500 which is ok I guess. time to fast again lol yay",False,False

I binge. I binged fucking hard.  I thought I would wake up feeling energized from the extra Calories, as I usually do when I binge while I'm on a restrictive diet, but instead I woke up dead fucking tired and my heart was racing from all the sugar.  I feel better on 300 Cals/day. Sure, I feel super weak and dizzy and everything gives me aches and pains, but at least I feel like I'm actually getting somewhere on my journey to look ethereal.  I felt so bad yesterday when I took off my pants in front of my boyfriend and his eyes got so sad and concerned and he said, ""...you look so..small.."" like tbh, I think he likes me at this weight, but I think he said it like that because he knows I still see myself as fat and disgusting, and that I'm still going to drop more weight.  It's not fair. I'm a 20 BMI, which is fucking normal, but everyone is telling me to stop now, and a 20 BMI is still fucking high. Most people don't get these comments until like a 16 or at least 17 BMI. It's not fair that my boyfriend using my ribcage as a gauge to tell me I'm starting to get underweight. I just have a fucking wide ribcage. The fact that you can feel all my single ribs means nothing. Why can't you look at my fat arms or my lack of spine bones instead? It's not fucking fair I have a horrible body type. If I can't have the gorgeous body type most women have, then please, let me have the bones I want instead.  I envision yesterday will be the last binge I'll have in a while, possibly ever. My gag reflex is completely 0 at this point. I tried purging but couldn't, with both hands, all 4/5 fingers in my mouth, with my knuckles bright red. I was cursed with an awful gag reflex (I have only purged a few times in this phase). Besides, restricting feels better than b/p for some reason now.",False,False

I saw myself as is in the mirror for once with no dysmorphia. The crazy thing is, I’m slightly bloated and don’t look any better or worse than normal. I just look as average as always and I don’t hate myself. It’s crazy. Everything I usually nitpick is there on full display and you know what? I could be worse. I sure as shit could be better, but I definitely am not the hideous disgusting monster this suffocating disorder forces me to see every day.
