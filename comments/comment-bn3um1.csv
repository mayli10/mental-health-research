It's very rare for me too, but compared to when I was restricting the most (it was literally nonexistent) it feels like a lot. That's honestly what I miss most about restricting.

I see a thousand posts per day on the relationship subreddits from people who have found their pErFeCt PeRsOn except for differing sex drives, and they always think it‚Äôs a massive issue and the advice is always to break up. I‚Äôm like?????? My boy and I have radically different sex drives (I have literally none) but we compromise and are both happy. I like masturbation but only because orgasms feel good, I never have the urge to do it.

Women are fun to look at but I don't get like... Tingles or anything. Same with men, although I sometimes get horny but not to specific fantasies or regarding people... Just a generic feeling. I'm in a long term relationship with a man and we are sexual active but way less than he wants and I don't really like... Want.
