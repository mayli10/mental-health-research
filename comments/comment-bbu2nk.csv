Cigarettes always seem like and all or nothing type of thing to quit. With how busy school/work is weening off of adderall I know will make me crash and burn. I’m trying to get more breaks from it though (for both tolerance and heart reasons)  Thank you so much!,False,True

I take a lot of uppers including illicit ones and walking is p much the only thing that calms me/makes me feel like my heart isn't going to explode. Just walking and really chill beats/fresh air is a god send.,False,False

The only time I've ever really felt like ""holy shit I'm about to die"" was when I was ECA stacking and smoking a pack a day. Even just cutting back to a few a day over smoking that much made my heart chill out.",False,False

I’m a restless person so I’ve been attempting to use hobbies for that purpose   I’m trying the app thing and I just bought one of those fancy light up bottles that remind you to drink water so *fingers crossed*,False,True

I enjoy lighthearted tones with bad shit. (Self deprecating humor keeps me sane)   But 2.   I already walk :-((  I’m that bitch that wakes up at 5am for walks. And from 5am until I eventually get to sleep, I’m nonstop going so remembering water is a rough one for me. But I’m working on it lol",False,True
