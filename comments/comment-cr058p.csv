Most of my symptoms started appearing at age 17 - that's when I first started trials of gut motility meds (unfortunately most all of them make me sick). I'm 19 now.  I feel like it takes a while for GP to develop - it's more to do with habitualizing. On and off restricting won't be as reinforcing of delayed emptying as straight up restricting, if that makes any sense.",False,True
