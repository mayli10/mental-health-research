But seriously, this is one of the biggest enigmas that I have yet to fathom the understanding of. Is it simply because I'm so disordered and stuck inside my prison of low self esteem that I'm really the only one making a big deal out of thigh cellulite and the public appearance of them in shorts (which I no longer wear without legging or tights underneath because ED) while no one else even cares? Because I've seen the exact scenario that you're talking about play out and it almost genuinely seems like others either don't notice or don't care.  But if the latter is true then is that because people *do* genuinely not care or is it because of the ""thick is in"" and ""she thicc, tho"" trend?   ðŸ¤”",False,False
