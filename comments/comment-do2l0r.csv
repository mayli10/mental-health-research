While we were out once, I had eaten a chocolate ice cream thing with chocolate sauce and it upset my stomach because of how sweet it was. When we left I was complaining about it, and we passed by a stand serving pork buns (which are great!) and he went ‚Äúoh, wanna share one?‚Äù and I said I‚Äôd have a few bites. (I feel better about food when I‚Äôm with him, but the ED voice is never fully gone)  Anyway, he paid for it and handed to me and I ate it so fast. Like, I didn‚Äôt even realize, but ate it so quick and it made my stomach feel a lot better. After the fact though he told me something along the lines of ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt eat like a normal person who‚Äôs already eaten in the day, you eat things like you‚Äôve never had anything before‚Äù and like,.. he‚Äôs right but that‚Äôs exactly WHY I don‚Äôt like eating things in front of people. I know I eat like this a lot of the time and really quickly but I just can‚Äôt help it.   I think part of it too is that I‚Äôm worried if I eat slowly, I might only be halfway done and the ED voice will get to me. It‚Äôs like I have to go all in when I eat or else I know I won‚Äôt have most of it.",False,False

I noticed I had a tendency to cover my mouth after every bite any time I ate something in public and asked about it here. Come to find, surprise surprise, SO MANY people with disordered eating do the same thing lol. I wish I could just put a big tent around me at all times tbh.",False,False

Me getting offered food at a work party or something: *Politely accepts a small piece*  Someone watching: *smirks because of course the fatty can't say no to food*  Me next time: *Politely declines any*  Someone else watching: *smirks because who does this fatty think they're fooling, fat chance that your ""diet"" will ever stick*  I know it's irrational. I mean, it's not TOTALLY irrational, because people really are thinking similar stuff about me and other people, but it's probably not this extreme and it's probably not just because someone happened to smile in my vicinity. But it doesn't mean existing as a person in public makes me any less anxious!!",False,False

Yet at the same time, sometimes I feel equally ashamed for *not* eating, like someone will look at me and be like ""haha how cute, the fatty is trying to improve itself.
