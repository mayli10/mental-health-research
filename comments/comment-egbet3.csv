Did you do a big workout and muscles might be holding onto water to recover? Agree on possibly poop. My period does weird things to my water retention so I can relate, thereâ€™s no possible way to gain 5 lbs in 2-3 days, just like you canâ€™t lose that in just 2-3 days (except water weight). I know I still freak out every month anyway even though I KNOW THIS. Hydrate today and youâ€™ll pee it out in a day or 2. sending you good vibes.",False,False
