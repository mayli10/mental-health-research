I found that if I try to turn it into a 'rule' my ED has to abide as a constant it makes it easier and I feel like it's more 'allowed'. I still hate myself for it, but less? because it isn't for me here now, fat fuck me, it's for my marks and future.",False,False

It   rises on a new day.    Everything that has happened in the last few hours are fleeting and will no   longer exist.    When you awake tomorrow, set your gaze away from the yesterday and fix it on   today.    Steady your mind for your ACT.   Free yourself   of all guilt and regret. Your suffering and pain today is your absolution   tomorrow.  Remember the universe is forgiveness. You are allowed to take a “croissant sandwich my grandma.”   Arise to a new day. A new start. A new begin. A clean slate. Don’t be so hard   on yourself.     Some days will better then others. You don’t deserve to carry this guilt.   Hope you have a good day. Hope this helped.",False,False
