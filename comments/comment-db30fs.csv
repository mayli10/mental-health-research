I'm sure that as a vegan with an ED you probably already put a good amount of thought into nutrition, but I like to share what I know in case it helps anyone who reads it :)",False,False

Most beans are very high in protein can be a healthy part of a person's diet. I believe that chickpeas are another high protein plant. In fact, peas in general likely are. I haven't looked into it because all peas are disgusting, but I know that a common form of protein is pea protein. It's a vegan-friendly alternative to whey protein and it's inexpensive to produce. I definitely prefer beans though. Tofu is made of soybeans and soy is another common protein used in supplements. Black beans are really popular, but I don't like them. I think that the beans used in cans of baked beans with tomato sauce are usually either white beans or pinto beans. In fact, I think those might even be the same kind of bean. Anyway, of the beans I've tried kidney beans and whatever they use in baked beans are the ones I like. I suppose I should mention that I have only tried red kidney beans, but I imagine kidney beans of other colours are not too different from each other. Nuts are another good source of protein, but they're a better source of fat than protein. They do tend to be high on polyunsaturated fats which are the healthy fats. If I remember correctly a couple of walnuts will give you nearly half your required omega-3 and all of your required omega-6 for a day. I think that almonds are all omega-3. But this post is about protein. Before I leave fats though, tofu is also a good source of polyunsaturated fats. Back to protein, I know that peanutbutter is often recommended as a good source of protein. I don't know protein content compares in different nuts, but they are generally good for it. I wouldn't want to make them my main protein source though. They have a lot of calories for the amount of protein in them. Lastly, some fruits are also high in protein, but not very many. Fruits are almost all carbs, but I think bananas are an unusual exception. That being said I did look it up and while bananas are high in protein for a fruit they are certainly not the greatest source of protein there is. The numbers may be skewed because I eat a high carb diet with a maximum of only 1500 calories a day, but a single banana account for 7% of my calorie goals while only providing 1% of my protein goals. I would not say bananas are a good source of protein, but they're also not a bad one.",False,False
