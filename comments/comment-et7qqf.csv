Is it bad/toxic that I feel like veganism is usually one sidestep away from disordered eating?  If eggs and cheese are more morally/eating-disorder-ly acceptable to you than sardines consider introducing boiled eggs and pieces of cheddar or parmiggiano cheese.,False,False

Progress is good. &gt;!The only real deficiencies i can see in your current diet are protein, the fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid and micronutrients. You're getting some of the fats in, you probably are getting some carbs but carbs are ok for most people, and you are getting some minerals. Do you find sardines or any other low-on-the-food-chain fish to be a safe food? Consider adding them on if you do.!&lt; (TW constructive criticism)",False,False
