Plus I'd just rather see other people eat, instead of me making all that stuff and having to taste it. Like no thanks, not going to put myself through this.  My therapist actually called me out on this the other day, said it's an unhealthy thing to do because it's just down to controlling things/food/etc, and I wasn't really inclined to believe him but reading your post has made me question that üòÇ",False,False

Like he forgets to eat, he doesn‚Äôt want full on home cooked meals, he prefers small cheap frozen dinners, he doesn‚Äôt have any kind of appetite or desire or ‚Äúfood palette‚Äù. It‚Äôs so strange because I was raised believing I should be cooking elaborate home cooked meals 24/7 for my man and everything should be fresh and filling because grown men have appetites. LOL then I date this guy and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh you made me a nice lunch? I wanna skip it I‚Äôm not hungry.‚Äù LIKE BRO I DONT WANNA BE THE ONLY ONE EATING STOP MAKING ME LOOK LIKE A CHUNKY MONKEY. I only cook for him. We eat different things. I cook him full on meals and my meal is always like a fiber one bar and he turns down the meal. :/ What‚Äôs even weirder is he‚Äôs a hockey player and I thought athletes are always hungry due to such high energy expenditures but he doesn‚Äôt notice it‚Äôs time to eat until before practice or a game and he‚Äôs like oh I might need protein from this protein bar. I‚Äôm like you idiot I made you protein packed salmon w/ veggies &amp; potatoes for dinner that YOU SKIPPED. He actually hates seeing me cook it‚Äôs one of our biggest arguments. He doesn‚Äôt wanna see me ‚Äúworking‚Äù so he says he would rather order in something disgusting and not fresh OR JUST EAT A SINGLE NASTY ASS PROTEIN BAR and he doesn‚Äôt understand that I thoroughly, as an anorexic, love cooking for others lmao.   In all honesty he has a lot of OCD habits and for some reason seeing me up doing stuff drives him crazy it‚Äôs bizarre. Like ok bro I‚Äôll sit here and be a bum then. I have to clean, do laundry, chores etc when I‚Äôm home alone or else he gets all weird that my attention isn‚Äôt fully on him üòí  the good thing is tho he doesn‚Äôt care when I fast, my low restriction diet and if I purge so I mean :/",False,False

Same with doing makeup, but idk if I'm just weird with that one  Maybe you could bake some stuff but put it in the freezer for later? I did that with pumpkin bread loafs and kept them as gifts when I visited my SO's family (after they dethawed of course lol)",False,False

I just wanna cook everything and watch him eat it and keep feeding him it‚Äôs so crazy. I get full watching him eat it‚Äôs bizarre. What pisses me off though is he has no appetite and is never hungry UGH,False,False
