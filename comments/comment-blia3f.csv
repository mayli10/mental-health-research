Also, I sometimes felt like I was in the middle of a full-on panic attack.    It did very effectively suppress my appetite, but I am not sure it was worth the side effects.      I sometimes still resort to these types of pills, but only when I am really, really desperate.    The problem might have been that I of course always took more than the recommended dosage, so maybe you just start with a single pill and see if you're ok and then slowly up the dosage?",False,False
