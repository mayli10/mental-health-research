Besides Aerie, I have also seen 28-30 band size bras at Winners (Canada; but the US has Marshalls and TJ Max I think? Or places like that?) for under $20, but it's a toss up if they actually have any or not. They also have bralettes and 'lounge bras,' which are another option.",False,False

I'm a 30A/AA at my current weight down from a 32B at my HW, and their bralettes have been my go-to.

You might want to look for a 30A if it is because that will also take the cup volume down; I think Aerie(in the US) sells them, but that’s the only place I’ve seen. If you’re in full coverage bras, which is unlikely for A cups but still, you can try looking for a Demi cut as those are a bit smaller. You might try looking for a wire free option as well as those can sometimes fit a little snugger.   Unfortunately, I have no experience with young women’s sizes and where to find them, but you could possible do a search through r/abrathatfits to see if they’ve more info or look into sites like True &amp; Co that offer you refunds and help finding the proper size if your first doesn’t fit.
