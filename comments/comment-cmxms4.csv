Honestly I think you’ll be able to talk to your psych about this without raising any red flags. Weight gain is a concern for most people I think and probably a dealbreaker for tons of people, not just those with EDs.",False,False

I'm sure that's super irrational lol,False,True

That said, a ton of meds I’ve been on list weight gain as a possible side effect, but only one actually caused weight gain. I’m terrified of that too but in my head the meds are worth trying if they make me feel better, but if I notice weight gain I’m out.",False,False
