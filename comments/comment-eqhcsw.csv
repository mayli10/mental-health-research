My husband, his family, my family, my friends. Not all of them know the extent that it got to, but my husband (he was my boyfriend at the time) and my friends found my ed insta detailing all the dirty deetz, so there was a lil intervention. That was like...4 years ago? Ive gained hella weight since then in the name of ""recovery"" but i think the only ones who know i still struggle are my husband and one of my close friends. And even then, i dont think they know im on a rather steep decline currently.",False,False

I joke about it all the time too so they won’t feel the need to worry. Plus my mom had an ed too so all she can really do is watch the dumpster fire (aka me) burn lmao.,False,False

I have really close friends where I live now and with one of them I'm like 'depression buddies' and we fasted together for days on end but for him it's natural since he forgets / doesn't care to eat and I don't think he would understand when I tell him this shit goes way deeper for me.",False,False
