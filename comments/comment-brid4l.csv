Tell them EVERYTHING. Do it for all the days you feel like hell. Do it for all the days you beat yourself up because you don't feel like hell or look like a 90s heroin addict.  You are VALID and you deserve to recover!,False,True

Iâ€™ve tried to explain it to people before but I honestly feel like nobody gets it except other OSFED sufferers. Everything sucks and Iâ€™m in absolute hell every day but Iâ€™m smack in the middle of a normal BMI and everybody thinks Iâ€™m totally fine and normal. And you feel like itâ€™s hard to justify seeking help and nobody takes you seriously when you do and thinks youâ€™re just looking for attention.   I have an intake appointment with an eating disorder specialty group tomorrow and I keep thinking Iâ€™m stupid to go and should save it for the skinny girls who actually need help :(,False,False
