I've tried just buying plain old psyllium husk but for whatever reason I got different results,False,False

The best feeling EVER is having your own BM. Please don't do it to yourself!! Coming from someone who went down that path--it's not worth it!,False,False

I also bought a 1kg bag and then the zipper broke and after that the quality just slowly started getting worse until it was unusable. Someone at a naturopathy shop did tell me that psyllium fiber is a bad option for people with certain GI problems.   I kind of worry that I have cysts, so she recommended pure aloe vera juice for the pain and maybe some other symptoms. I don't really remember. It's pretty gross. I think I need more than she recommended to get the desired effect though. She recommended a capful once or twice a day, but that's way less than the recommended dose on the bottle. I never tried taking the recommended dose regularly, so maybe it would help if I did.   I tried a stimulant laxative recently because I have been sick and constipated. It said to take one or two pills before bed and that it should work between 6 and 12 hours. It took over 12 hours to work, so I'm wasn't sure if it actually helped or if my body did everything on it's own. I tried again the next night with the same dose (mainly because it's a box of 10 pills so I would have 1 left if I went up to 2) and it definitely worked. It got progressively worse as it did it's job that. It became very painful. I also ended up with diarrhea later that night. Well, I think I did. I'm not entirely sure. That was last night actually. I didn't take another dose because that did most of the work I needed it to already and I am just not prepared to face another whole week without some kind of time off. I was busy with an event for school all weekend, so I didn't have time to anything I wanted to or needed to. I'm hoping that at least one night off will be enough for me to handle the next week. My gastroenterologist actually prescribed me a different medication but my insurance will only cover it if I tried laxatives and antispasmodics beforehand and found them to be ineffective or found that I can't handle them.   I'm sure there are other ways to help with bowel movements that I haven't tried, but I typically don't actually have problems with them. My only issues are when I'm sick or when I haven't been eating enough. I always have other issues though. I suppose I have been hopeful that whatever was causing the other symptoms might clear up if I took something to deal with bloating. My doctor says that bloating is usually caused gas or water retention, but it seems like my body doesn't absorb things properly during digestion, so I have wondered if perhaps my digestive tract works slower than it should. That could explain how I end up bloated from eating without gas problems and have regular BMs. I'm really just planning to finish off this box so I can tell my doctor to make an official note that I can't handle laxatives.",False,False
