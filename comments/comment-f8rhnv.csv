The thing is, he doesn't even need to understand it himself, he just needs to understand that it's a serious issue and it does affect you in a very real way. As your partner he should at least be willing to accept that. You shouldn't be sacrificing your own mental health and wellbeing just because he has stuff on at work- lots of people experience work stress and don't belittle their partner's struggles because of it.  I honestly do understand how you feel, and it's a hard one as you say because it can be hard to know how to talk to them about it. I'm lucky that my partner gets my food struggles, but I've had plenty of people who don't see the big deal. But the fact is that it does affect you, and he needs to accept that his view of it is pretty narrow and it leaves you feeling like you can't talk to him and get that support from him that, as your partner, he should want to provide.",False,False

I think the problem is that he is a logical person and not very empathetic, he doesnâ€™t get eating disorders and views it as a teenage vanity issue caused by social media Iâ€™m not even sure how to bring it up with him to be honest, I feel like Iâ€™m making a mountain out of a molehill every time I mention it :/ heâ€™s got things going on with work right now and I donâ€™t want to cause extra stress or feel like a pain Iâ€™ve been watching some YouTube videos about anorexia recovery and her boyfriend was crazy supportive, whereas he wonâ€™t even mention unless I do",False,True

My partner has gone through things that I haven't but I would never turn around to her and tell her that others have it worse. I think he's been extremely invalidating to you, and not understanding isn't really an excuse. If you've made it clear you really struggle with an ED, his response should be to find out more and try to understand how it might be affecting you and what he can do to support you.  I think you need to have this discussion with him and tell him explicitly how it makes you feel when be says things like that. You'll know who he really is as a person based on his response.",False,False

Itâ€™s like he just doesnâ€™t care sometimes Thank you for your help though ðŸ˜Š",False,True

Itâ€™s difficult for normal eaters to understand and ends up sounding like petty and insignificant issues to them. Iâ€™m not at all saying that it is though! My husband has gone to many therapy and nutritionist appointments with me, and that did help, but he still struggles to wrap his mind around it. Open communication is important. Maybe give him some articles to read, and tell him how you felt invalidated by what he said. Also though if you are always talking about it, he may feel weary, and unsure of how to support you.",False,False

My boyfriend is supportive but is really invalidating. Every time I tell him I'm struggling, he just says ""you're gonna be ok"" and it really gets tough to be open up to him.  I don't think you're asking for too much at all. Sometimes we just need someone to understand that we feel like crap, instead of undermining it or saying everything will be okay.",False,False
