If she really thinks she's recovered, then speaking to her mom might be setting fires unnecessarily. From what you've said, she hasn't relapsed /yet/. Keep an eye on her for behaviors. Hopefully, catching things early will give her mom enough time to get her back into treatment without putting your friendship at risk.",False,False

She is not in therapy &amp; believes she is 100% recovered... Should I maybe bring up to her mother? They are very very close with each other so I assume her mother would have noticed these behaviors already...but maybe she’s is good at hiding them from her mom... guess I’m sort of thinking out loud here.,False,True

It doesn't sound like a healthy relationship for you, and if you mentioned  your disorder I think it could trigger her.",False,False

She is looking for validation that she did the “right thing” and the “strong thing” by going through with recovery because she doesn’t always believe it herself.  I’ve been there. It’s fine and normal to feel like some part of you has been shaped by your disordered experiences, but it shouldn’t be fundamental to your identity. I would not open up to her, if only because she would not be a useful support person. How long ago was she in treatment? If I had to bet, she will eventually hit enough of a bump in the road to relapse or latch on to another control mechanism. I hope she is still in therapy and getting the long-term recovery support she needs.",False,False

My other friends think she is just an attention seeker &amp; has discovered that will get her a great deal more attention than other things. She is currently living in VA &amp; I live in NH so at least for now we aren’t super close but she will be coming back in September.,False,True

I wonder how recovered she really is. It sounds like she is holding on to those habits even if she is not actively engaging in them.   It is a tricky situation. Because if you tell her that her talking about it makes you uncomfortable she might take that the wrong way, like you just don't care about her problems.   Maybe see what some of your other friends think. But I also think (for you) she is a toxic person even if she does not do it on purpose. I would put some distance between you if you can.",False,False
