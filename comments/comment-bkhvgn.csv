I am not someone who wears makeup or fancy dresses.    But sometimes I put way more effort into my hairstyle and choice of my clothes and even wear some jewelry and my bf never notices.   During our relationship I gained and lost 17-18lbs and he said I always look the same... Well... THANKS for making me feel like a loser and that I still look like my ugly and fat self after losing freaking 18lbs! (I know he didn't mean it in that way... but it feels horrible.),False,False

I’m sure he thought you looked amazing and just didn’t verbalise it! You should ask him to say so next time he’s thinking about how pretty you are and how lucky he is to have you.,False,False
