Before my boyfriend was my boyfriend, we had a 'thing' but with rules (dumb ik) and he ended up cheating on me (I guess) with about four girls. I think that's where my bulimia stemmed from because I though/think they all look better than me. Sometimes I feel extremely stupid for still being with him because I fear I'll actually be cheated on this time. I just want to let you know that you are a good person and as long as you feel good enough for yourself, thats all that matters. I'm very bad at making people feel better so I apologize for this mess of a reply.",False,False
