Lift heavy weights at least 3 times per week  This is really hard for us ED folk to do. You can not eat 1000 cals/day and waste away on your couch napping. It's a total mindset change and a step in the direction of recovery.,False,False

I feel like a big issue that most of us in this community have is that we don't realize what we're doing to our insides by restricting until it starts to show physically. I know it will be hard, but if you try to eat at least 1,200 cal a day I think you will be able to gain the muscle and lose the fat more easily",False,False
