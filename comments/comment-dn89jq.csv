No one would guess I have a 24 inch waist in clothes but when I'm naked I've got this bony ass ribcage and then giant boobs that are so heavy they hurt my back and honestly aren't that pert either, like I get boob sweat under them because they hang over and stick.   I would kill to lose even an inch or two off my boobs but I've already lost over 30 lbs from my highest weight, and the last 15 or so I haven't lost a single inch off my chest, only my waist. At this point I'm afraid I'll get down to a 17 BMI and still have 36 inch boobs and a 22 inch waist.",False,False

I don't wanna be CURVY, i wanna be BONES. I haven't lost a single inch off my chest, but 3 inches off my waist and one off my hips.
