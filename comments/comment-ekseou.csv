Friends shouldn't be talking like that to one another. I'm sorry she said such a rude comment to you.  Lighting plays a huge effect on how you look. I've noticed a lot of gyms have some pretty awful lighting especially in the fitness classrooms- usually relatively harsh/direct lighting from the ceiling, which is like, the worst. Because it shows every shadow cast of every lump or wrinkle directly beneath. My money is on the lighting being shit compared to your home... you probably have more ambient light at your house so it softens everything. That's why sometimes certain dressing rooms make outfits look awful. The lighting sucks.  this coming from someone who studied this shit pretty extensively as an art student...",False,False

I think we all look different in others eyes and thats also what drives me nuts :( but if you start to see yourself more beautiful then thats all you need. I think others see us more beautiful when we start to accept our beauty more.,False,False

Like, I noticed on my medicine cabinet in the bathroom in my apartment that the mirror has a small section that's slightly convex. I doubt any mirror has such big issues. It could be lighting I suppose. Or maybe your gym clothes? It's hard to guess. I know that when I take selfies in my hallway mirror while wearing a crop top that if I stand in the right spot the lighting makes my stomach look completely flat. Different lighting can also make it look way bigger than it actually is too. Maybe the gym lighting just sucks.",False,False
