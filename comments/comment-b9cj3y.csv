The shock and confusion and all. Planned Parenthood is great with giving you all of your options. Also remember that you have a lot of hormones fucking with your mental state as well. I was a wreck. You donâ€™t have to make a decision right this moment. Give yourself some time to think about it. There are some great communities on Facebook for emotional support when making your decision. And if you need someone to talk to, feel free to send me a message. ",False,False
