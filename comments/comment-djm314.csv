Whatever his journey is with disordered eating, it is not your fault. That is not a burden you have to carry &lt;3 Sadly, it’s a fairly frequent experience for someone to start pursing healthy changes, and then to cross some invisible line into disordered eating behavior that can take on a life of it’s own. Have you tried expressing your concern to him? I’m not that great at talking about the real stuff with people but the “I feel ( ) when ( ) because ( )” format from therapy has been helpful to me. Which is some of what I hear you saying in your post actually. That you feel worried when you see him engaging in certain behaviors because you want him to be around and healthy for a long time. Maybe that could be a place to start? I can relate to having intense worrying about whether I’ve hurt someone and it spiraling into a very dark brain space, so I hope some light finds its way in today.",False,False
