While chicken breast, for example, has 22 grams of protein per 100 calories, peanuts only have 4.4 grams/100 calories. Turkey breast has 19.5 grams/100 calories while beans have 4.1 grams/100 calories.   It truly can be challenging to get enough protein on a vegan diet. I exercise 5-6 days a week and need a bare minimum of 80 grams of protein per day. During those 3 weeks of eating vegan I averaged less than 30 grams of protein per day. And towards the end of the time I felt horrible and my workout were suffering.   It's not appropriate to push eating restrictions on other people. The same diet doesn't work for everyone, especially on an ED sub.",False,False
