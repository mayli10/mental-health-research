I haven't read it in years, but I did buy it and think I liked it.   •*Echo* by Francesca Lia Block- Echo fantasy novel by Francesca Lia Block, published in 2000 by Harper Collins. It follows the life of Echo, who, in her teens, meets a boy with angel wings, for whom she still finds herself waiting for years later. Some chapters are, however, almost completely dedicated to lives of her friends, family and boyfriends.  This was one of my favorites. The eating disorders are more like just a few chapters, anorexia to orthorexia, but she had a relatable mentality through out.  •*The Hanged Man* by Francesca Lia Block- After the death of her father, Laurel is haunted by a legacy of hidden shames and family secrets. Immersing herself in the heady rhythms of Los Angeles, in the ever-quickening drumbeat of life on the edge, Laurel discovers a passion so powerful it brings her face to face with the terrible demons in her past, and threatens to send her spiraling out of control.  This one, the story focuses more on the effects of the anorexia the main character deals with.  All thre are fiction. I'll try and post if I think of more. ",False,False
