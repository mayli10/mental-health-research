Waking up with the chance to lose weight in a few days. To make my own image, to reshape myself, as my weakness disappears. Bringing myself closer to the distant image of perfection in my mind. It feels like running to it in the distance through a dark tunnel. It is like the adrenaline rush i get from exercising, of pushing and pursuing a goal. That's why restricting brings me joy at times.",False,False

I never relate to binge posts because I’ve convinced myself that feeling hungry is good and it means I’m doing something right, and I’ve never been one for purging. But I love the feeling when I’m restricting and fasting.",False,False
