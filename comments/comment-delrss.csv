Even though I understand nutrition/how I should be eating very well, I’m so glad I went to see her anyways. If its free, it’s certainly a great resource to take advantage of. I told her up front that I understood what I SHOULD be doing, so our time together was focused on things I was struggling with, like going to the grocery store and eating mindfully ans intuitively. Not all dietitians are great, or have experience with ED patients, but I would definitely at least give it a chance.",False,False
