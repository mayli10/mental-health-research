When I notice positive change, I suddenly give myself permission to eat what I want because now I look better (even though it’s only ever slightly)   2. I get so afraid I’ll “accidentally” ruin my progress somehow so I’ll just condemn myself to failure before I get that chance   3. I’m coming off a restricting/fasting period so my body legitimately does need to refuel (albeit not as extremely as the extent of my binges)   This is relatively new for me too... I’ve only been struggling for a few years now.   Hopefully we can retrain that weird part of our brains to actually be logical! The all or nothing mentality is never helpful",False,True

I wish I understood the mechanism in our brains that causes this. I can do so well for days or even weeks...but the moment I notice something good about my efforts I fall face first into anything edible within my line of sight.   Most recently I started jogging again and noticed my legs lookin a bit more toned. And then I enjoyed that feeling for about a day and a half before eating enough to make myself ashamed.  I just wanna switch that part of my brain off. Also...why is it even on in the first place?? I never had this issue years ago. But here I am...losing and gainin the same few pounds over and over and over and over....,False,False
