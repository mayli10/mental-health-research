Yesterday it was just pretty much cauliflower in the morning, and then cauliflower and bell peppers at dinner time. So, yeah, I was probably asking for it. ",False,True

Definitely keep hydrating with electrolytes though because you probably are pretty dehydrated. Maybe some dry crackers too, treat it like you would food poisoning. Obviously it might be more than just the cauliflower so I guess take it easy, monitor yourself and be ready to make a doctors appointment if you need.",False,False

But, I did double down on it yesterday. I had a similar reaction to too much kale a while ago, but I didn’t feel nearly as bad afterwards. Right now I feel like I have the flu - my entire body hurts.

Because I get this problem too. Just posted on another thread about it actually. But cauliflower rice holy heck. I’ve only ever had it twice, once about 300g and another time 100g both times my stomach swelled up like a drum and the cramps nearly had me in tears they were so bad. Eventually went to the bathroom and wow, ouch and also I’ve never had such a um liquefied experience. The last time I had cauliflower rice it was for lunch and the bloating, cramping and bathroom trips didn’t subside until late into the evening.  It’s weird though because for me I can eat 100g cauliflower florets and have no issues at all. I know some people can get issues just from florets too so considering you ate lots of cauliflower and then ate cauliflower rice I’d say that’s the cause/culprit! Sucks because cauliflower rice is such a good low cal alternative to rice.",False,False
