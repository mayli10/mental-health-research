I've been on all sides of the spectrum. Superskinny, ""buff"" as I can be as a woman and chubby. Never ever did I think once I was good enough and always wanted what I didn't have. At one point, you just have to look in the mirror and tell yourself you are good enough and that you're greatful for the body that gives you the ability to see the world, be with friends and family, laugh..  Hope you get some peace in mind.",False,False

You will look leaner because muscles take up less volume than fat, so even at a lower weight with less muscles you might not look as lean, 3. Your body will thank u later when you get older. Numbers ain't everything and I can only think of lots of pros for having muscles and I'd gladly swap that any day for a set weight that changes every time you hit the goal anyways....",False,False
