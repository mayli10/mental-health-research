For what its worth, the same thing happened to me a few weeks ago. I was probably in the bathroom for 30mins fretting and pacing. And in the end, I didnt. Your validity of this isnt determined by something you do, but rather how hard it must have been to /not/ do it.  Sometimes things that feel like failures are our biggest successes. That must have been a hard thing to do, but your priority of your health won over, which is amazing. Purging is very bad, and you stopped it. That in itself is amazing self control! Be proud, thats a big step.",False,False
