I grew up with some good cooking while my fiance ended up having to raise himself and his siblings for a lot of his childhood. How did our SOs get so lucky lol üòÖ that last sentence is so true and seems like my daily motto now. I wish I could eat for sustenance alone and not be so entirely consumed by flavors and texures and the desire to be full, not just simply satisfied, even though many times I've been stuffed uncomfortably and never want to eat again in that moment and tell myself I  won't overeat again. I wish üôÑ",False,False

He doesn‚Äôt think much about food, and would go without it if he could. My mother is a chef now and was an amazing home cook before then, so I grew up with really good food around the house constantly. Always something new to try, so I learned to be excited about food. I like to cook and taste and eat, during the worst parts of my ED my day was basically centered around when I could eat and everything else (work, school, socializing) was a distraction from those periods. I hate how food has taken such a focus in my life, because it seems like something that should be a rather insignificant part of my day. Eat to live, not live to eat and all that.",False,False

Food is life for me and a huge passion. I love cooking and baking. I plan my days around food. Meanwhile, my fiance doesn't care that much or has intense cravings beyond what he wants in that moment. Doesn't daydream about food and isn't consumed constantly about what food he wants to eat. So extremely lucky.
