I do OMAD now at 300 Cals/day and it isn't horrible. I don't think the difference is the Calories, at least not all of it, I think it also has to do with how keto-adapted you are.",False,False

I feel high, light and euphoric when I fast. Don't just fast on water though, drink snake juice to supplement your body with the basic salts it needs to survive. It makes it easier for me to fast. I find that it brings me a lot of mental clarity and sharpness so I make sure I'm always in a fasted state when I'm in class.",False,False

Which will be fun times or not so fun times depending how adapted you are to that. I can focus well while fasting, but I don't want to, I just kind of want to laze around. I did a long fast before my exams, and I can't say whether it was good or bad. If I hadn't eaten something before the exams though my memory would have been shot. Sleeping is also an issue yes.   As for long fasting while underweight: Don't. If you don't feel like total shit during the fast.. it will hit. And it will be brutal.",False,False

The first 3-4 days, I felt totally normal, but from day 5 on, I was totally in a dreamworld.  I had an easy cashier job at the time, but would not have been able to be an effective student.",False,False

I try not to fast before important tests/deadlines because it's hard to study when all you want to do is sleep lmao  please stay safe friend and listen to your body when fasting!,False,False
