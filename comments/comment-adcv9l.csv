I don't want my SO to just be ""accepting"" my body and flaws because he's with me. I don't trust any compliments he gives - he doesn't do it too often, but I still can't accept them because it feels like he's just saying what's obviously expected of him when you've been together 2+ years.",False,False

But it‚Äôs not so much that someone will ‚Äúsettle for you‚Äù but more that you‚Äôll find someone who loves your body.   I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for about 3 years, and we love everything about each other. I was obese when we started dating, and he always told me how beautiful I was. 50 pounds later, he compliments my hard work and tells me he can see the progress I‚Äôve made and he loves my body. It‚Äôs not easy, it takes time, but you will find someone who loves your body for what it is, not just because they can bang you.",False,False

Fiancee likes a range of boob sizes/shapes! Like someone else said, B's are ""a perfect handful."" Larger boobs (like my own) are way less interesting to me personally because they lack novelty, but they still feel nice and soft and pillowy &lt;3    You're afraid someone will ""settle"" for you, meaning they don't perceive to be super attractive based on their own beauty ideals. There are a couple points I'd make in response: (1) Yes, this could happen to you, but it says more about your partners shitty mental space than you (more below) (2) People really do have more diverse tastes and desires than are marketed to us (3) You can ask your partner to talk to you about what they find physically attractive in partners (about you, previous partners, people on the street, etc); I specifically feel safe with my partner because I know (based on honest conversations with me about his previous partners, his feelings about my body, his porn habits) that he is attracted to a variety of women's bodies. Not all people like a wide variety, but there are lots who do and someone with an ED background should probably look for a partner like that! It makes me feel really safe because I know he won't mind if my weight fluctuates as he's into a range of ""softness.""   Honestly, I would be super turned off if my partner was ""settling"" for me, not because I would then feel unattractive, but because I would be like ""what the fuck dude, don't you think you can get the thing you want??"" It's deeply unattractive for someone to settle on their job, their relationships, their happiness...it tells me they don't have much confidence. ",False,False

I was intimate with someone for the first time this week. I spent years not even looking at my own body, but once we were naked I felt 'who gives a fuck?!' and tried to just be in the moment. Then afterwards, I thought how he said nothing about my body. Not even a half-assed, lustful comment like 'you're hot' or 'i love your [fill-in-the-blank]. And then I felt average. It crushed me and it's still bothering me. It's as if I'm allowed to completely hate my body and think it's garbage, but when someone else treats it as nothing it suddenly bothers me.   I don't see this guy for another month and all I can think is getting him to say anything! I want a 'wow' or 'holy fuck' the next we're together. I've read hundreds of Reddit comments about how guys don't care; but I do.   PS. B cups are awesome! We can dress them up or down and are the perfect handful.
