I think if I regularly c/s then i would have worried about hiding it but my SO just laughed at me and was like “come on, it wasn’t that bad”   I haaaate when I eat something that wasn’t worth eating. Especially if it’s high calorie. My calories are too precious to be wasting on something I didn’t enjoy",False,False

That’s bold! Usually I’ll use the napkin if I’m doing it at the table. There’s nothing worse than getting hit with calories from something you don’t even like eating :( ",False,True

So I spit it out right into the plate &amp; he said “wtf, that lady is looking at you like you are crazy”  I didn’t give a fuck. I was just like “oh, I didn’t like it”     Which itnwasnt bad enough to spit out but I was already stressed about the eating out calories... I wasn’t adding in a bite of rice I wasn’t prepared for ",False,False

I used to SH in class and thought no one noticed. Or drink alcoholically and thought no one noticed. They noticed. They just didn’t know what to say.
