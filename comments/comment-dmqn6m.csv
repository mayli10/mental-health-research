With recovery you are recovering your mental health and your physical health.   Try to research for licensed people who have experience with eating disorders. Depending on your insurance, or if you can afford it, they have outpatient eating disorder recovery clinics that have both specialists.  If that is not an option, I would recommend looking at lots of videos on recovery on youtube. This will tell you other peoples experiences, what to expect, what they recommend, how they ate, etc.  If you haven't, I would get a general physical and an EKG at the doctors to get a general idea of any physical damage to your body and organs.   Always see a doctor or specialist first if you can :)   Good luck!!!",False,False
