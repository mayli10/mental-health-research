I get so incredibly defensive when my friends get annoyed by that. They think trying on and obsessing over the small details of an outfit for an hour or so each time is ridiculous. Why can’t they understand what a big deal this is to me? Because of my body issues? I have to make sure the outfit looks “good” from every angle....constant body checking.....so many clothes I wish I could wear but I can’t because I feel too fat in my body. Tons of items with the tags still left on because I don’t feel good enough to wear them :/,False,False

I am limited to basically 3 outfits when I feel fat and it sucks because I have a lot of really cute clothes. I just can't dress up when I feel so fat. I only look good when I am very slim and the way people respond is proof.,False,False

My ideal style is like grunge-y. Old tees, ripped jeans, etc. oversized but in a cool way. Really cool looking. But I feel like that style only looks much better on stick thin guys and gals. It’s part of the reason why I only started dying my hair bright/fun colors again once I lost some weight",False,False

A few days ago I dressed in a cute androgynous outfit and I felt so wonderful. But when I got home, undressed, and saw my body, I felt so stupid and embarrassed.  One time I was watching *Midsomer Murders* and two inspectors were in the home of an art historian victim. One remarked on how unusually bland her home was for someone who so obviously had a great appreciation for aesthetics. The other replied that perhaps she didn’t feel that she deserved anything nice. I started crying.",False,False
