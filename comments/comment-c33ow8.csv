It’s nice to hear that things are mostly going better for you, and I’m sorry this happened. It really sucks to feel like you’re out of control, and for things to suddenly take a dip when they seem to be alright.  My advice would be to not beat yourself up over it. Slip-ups happen, unpleasant as they may be, and when they do, the best thing you can do in move onwards and up. You still made it two weeks without a binge, and I think that’s awesome!  It sounds like you've been working really hard, in your work life, in your social life, in your personal life, etc. It's great that you’re making progress, just be careful not to burn yourself out— I personally find that doing too much puts me in a not-so-great headspace.  Take care! Hope you’re feeling better soon! &lt;3",False,False
