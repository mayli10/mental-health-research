A pecan tree is as much of a curse as it is a blessing. Pecans in your car, under the hood, under your tires. Pecans cracking under every step you take. Squirrels fist fighting each other in your yard. Always slipping and having your shoes roll around on them when you try to walk. Pecans in the street, on the roof, in your attic. You wake up one day- pecans in your bed and spilling out of your nose and mouth. You should get a pecan tree haha. ",False,True
