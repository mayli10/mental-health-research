I keep ginger chews on me all the time in case I start to feel nauseous. You can find some that are literally just ginger and no sugar at Trader Joe’s/ Whole Foods/ other health food stores. I know it beats the purpose of fasting but nausea is seriously the worst feeling. It might help. Take care.",False,False

I’ve got my day started and I’m doing alright now, I just got scared because I’ve never had that happen. I’m doing alright now except for a bruised knee.
