Like I hit 14.5 (13.9 new BMI) at one point and was like ‚Äúhmm‚Äù not seeing anything different. Sometimes I wonder if it‚Äôs the metric that‚Äôs wrong, like somehow my body is the exception but at the same time I know that I‚Äôm not doing well. It‚Äôs got to be a dysmorphia thing.

My BMI at my lowest was like 14 and I didn‚Äôt look skeletal, just tiny overall since I‚Äôm so short. I guess I was never sick enough because I never had to go in IP, I just saw a dietitian and therapist for awhile. I feel like a total whale when I‚Äôm over 90 lbs, which is why I‚Äôve never let myself get to a healthy BMI for my height.  I know how much it sucks, and I‚Äôm sorry üòï ",False,False

But I swear my actual BMI is at least two points lower than what I look like. And it‚Äôs not just a distorted body image or anything like that. I posted pictures in an ED forum a few years ago and was straight up accused of lying about my stats/told my scale must be broken because there was no way I was as low as I ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù to be.  My scale worked just fine.  It sucks. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling shitty .,False,False
