It's really hard to accept the truth of what we do to ourselves. Once you accept the truth I think there is only so long you can keep up the behaviour at a high intensity.   My current line is ""it's just until I get my life under control, I just need to have control over this one thing"" but it's not something I can control. It's a false promise.   It feels like it helps right now though so.... I'm still doing it.   I'm glad you appreciated my comment, I'm sorry it's more do what I say than do what I do :P   ",False,False

It really means a lot that you took the time out to type this for me :)   But trust me, I believe you. I actually started restricting first when I was 10 years old. I restricted until I was 17 despite the fact that I was never even overweight. Then I switched to a binge eating disorder for the last few years and became obese because I got sick (unrelated to my ED) and couldn’t exercise anymore. Plus I was depressed about being chronically ill (I couldn’t get out of bed for over a year). Now I’m physically healthy (illness has been cured) so I’m heading back to my restrictive ways and I guess I’m just making excuses because I don’t want to accept the truth :/ ",False,True

Idk I know it's not healthy weight loss and I know it's going to get away from me someday, but for now I'm just like... Let's ride this gravy train.   I'm not losing hair? I'm taking vitamins? I binge occasionally so I don't feel like I'm going to have some issues other people do? ",False,False

Everyone celebrated my weightloss regardless of my methods and I believed like you do. I had minimal side effect's until I dropped onto the healthy range when dizziness and blackouts started effecting me every day. The habits I taught myself to loose that unhealthy weight stuck their claws in. Extreme calorie deficit triggers response in your body after a while. Your thinking becomes rigid and obsessive, you develop rituals around food, hoard food. These things happen to people without ED's who are forced to restrict heavily for long periods. You can look up reaserch done around famine to find this stuff.  When I reached a healthy weight I couldn't stop. My body and brain had rebuilt itself around hunger. I had a full blown ED and it's been haunting me for years.   You might not be harming your body that much now, or it might be more good then bad, but this kind of eating has huge ramifications for your mind and the way your body reacts to food in the long term.
