Sounds like they have a drinking problem so are choosing to focus on your issues to distract them theirs.  I struggled for a long time to set boundaries because I didn't have the tools to communicate them or the self confidence to enforce them. This person reminds me of someone who I used to be friends with. I didn't realise at the time how toxic it was because I blamed it on myself for not saying things clearly or letting things go when I should have said something, but looking back on it I think they liked hanging out with me because I was a push over",False,False

I have been more open with them lately but another thing is that they like to publicly bully me for being slow, so anything I say defaults to that anyway. I carefully choose my words so that even the rare chance I stand up for myself I say nothing degrading, but they will plead drunk or sick in every situation and refuse to read through our text conversation so we can get even close to being on the same page. Idk who they think they are but if somebody told me I hurt their feelings I would at least read the texts to see where I went wrong.",False,True

Exhausting.   I feel like the people who do this to me are doing it more for their benefit than mine. They get to pat themselves on the back for doing the ""right thing"", even though it's so misguided and hurtful.   Maybe you could bring it up that you are feeling really judged at the moment and you need the space and support to look after yourself on your own terms. Your more likely to want to engage with it if it's coming from a loving and gentle place, not a guilt filled controlling one.",False,False
