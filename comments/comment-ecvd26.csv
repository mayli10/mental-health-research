A swimsuit, even shorts? I‚Äôm just hyper-self conscious of the wobble as I move. Especially on my thighs and upper arms. I‚Äôve been saying to myself that I want to work out and get more toned/strong for years now...I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs stopping me anymore? Hopefully I feel inspired by you! üíú",False,False

Like I said, on the bright side I do look thin at my lw with clothes on, I just look a bit fucked in a swimsuit. I‚Äôm trying to just let it go and focus on the health and longevity benefits of getting more fit and muscular. If it improves my appearance it‚Äôs a bonus. But yeah, it‚Äôs hard with ED brain to live with the fact that there‚Äôs probably nothing I could do to have a body like Steqhs without a.) paying thousands in full body lipo to remove the fat cells or b.) literally dying??? At least I know there‚Äôs more to life than being thin (as great as it is)",False,False

Even when I was at my lowest weight and had an UW BMI it was like I was wearing a very thin fat suit all over my body. I‚Äôm trying again very seriously this time to get back to close to that weight but I‚Äôm working out to get more muscle.
