Like tonight I made spaghetti squash noodles. I put safe ingredients into everything (peas, seasoning, some masala sauce that I measured out), then put my half in my bowl. Then I put sautéed garlic in a ton of oil and mixed in heavy cream and made his side sooo delicious. I tried one bite and it was a hundred times better than mine. Of course, I would never ever do that to his food if he wasn’t okay with it but he likes how I deluxify his meals so it’s a consensual and symbiotic relationship where he gets yummy food and I vicariously live through making it.   But to answer the question more directly absolutely. I loveeeee gifting people bakes. I really want to have my own bakery one day so I can do it AND get paid. That’d be so rad. I don’t know if it’ll be what I really do but it’s one of my dreams.",False,False
