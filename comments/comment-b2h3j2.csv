There is literature behimd the movement and intuitive eating, and I can send you references if you would like.

Eating disorders don't care who we are or what we do. I'd say that the dissonance of what we *know* vs. what we *do* is a part of the disorder.

I don't think people will take it badly, either.  Mental illness strikes. It just does.
