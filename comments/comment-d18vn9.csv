It sounds like you might need to step up your level of care if possible. 3 weeks is a very short time to break any behaviours you've likely spent a while behaving in.  If you can, be honest with your team and parents about your behaviour and ask for their support in stopping them. It'll feel awful at first, but the more you are able to stop engaging in them, the easier it becomes.",False,False
