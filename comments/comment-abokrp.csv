Super cool if you dont wanna go outside to walk, and 'easy' enough for my grandmother to do them. She incorporates arm movement and different intensity levels depending on what your looking for and what your body can handle. She has 1, 3, and 5 mile walk videos and they all include stretching, warm up and cool down portions of the workout. I would highly reccomend of your looking for low intensity cardio. ",False,False
