About an hour before your game (so you have a lil digestion time, no vomming) try eating some nuts and maybe a slice or two of whole grain bread with peanut butter or cheese. That way, you get healthy carbs, fats, and proteins with fewer calories that will fuel your game while hopefully allowing you to have a deficit (if you feel you must).   I hope you can stay healthy for your games",False,False
