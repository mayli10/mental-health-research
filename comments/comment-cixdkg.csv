It probably momentarily felt good to get the b/p out of your system, but now look at where it got you. It didn‚Äôt make you feel happy or fulfilled, right? It just satisfied a temporary urge, but made you feel worse in the long run. So recovery is probably going to be the opposite of that. It‚Äôs going to be really hard, and really uncomfortable.. but you have a shot at being better if you just go through the motions and try to get through it. If you‚Äôre having really strong urges, talk them out with your care team. Tell them what you‚Äôre going through and why. Maybe if they understand, they‚Äôll be able to help you get through it and stay accountable. I‚Äôm not recovered, but I‚Äôm working with a team currently. I definitely want to run for the hills just thinking about what‚Äôs expected of me, and goals that I have to meet. But I‚Äôm actively trying to push past some of that discomfort and set up a safety bet of a few trusted individuals who can help urge me forward when I want to turn the other way and run. I wish you the best of luck, and I really hope that when shit gets tough, you get tougher. üíú",False,False
