I have actually the complete opposite experience, because where I come from fasting is not something anyone does or want to do (if you are not in a spiritual retreat) but everyone is on a diet, almost all the time  But if I try to think it from their perspective. Calorie restriction is usually a long term thing, like for months, while a fast is max 3 days a year. Plus research have found that fasting (up to 3 days max) has some benefits, adding to that many people have spiritual/ritualistic views of fasting as a ""cleanse"" or ""detox"" or a ""sign of will power and spiritual strength"" and not just for weight loss.   But here comes misinformation, because you can still meet your nutrients while restricting, which is not bad for health.",False,False

My parents own a weight loss clinic and people really have a hard time with mentally accepting permanent life changes. ""Diets"" fail because, once you stop the diet/restricting, your weight goes back up. It's a lot easier for many people to break it up into more manageable tasks (fasts), which are done intermittently. They don't have to face their daily lack of self control because they're running small sprints. It's more planned, so they feel better about the nutrients as well.

Telling me that I was unhealthy unless I was eating 2400 calories every other day.  My problem is when they say “you can eat whatever because CICO!” But at the same time vilifying people who eat less than 1200.
