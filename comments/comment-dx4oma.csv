Literally only a few days ago I put up a silly note to myself on the wall next to my laptop: ""NO FOOD UNTIL MONDAY"" and then underneath listed everything edible I have in my fridge/ pantry. The idea was to constantly remind myself that I have enough calories to last a fucking month so I should stop buying more food that will risk killing whatever progress I've made.   List looks like this, crossing off as I go: - oats - eggs - pears - ~~salad~~ - baked beans - ~~tofu~~ - dumplings - noodles   and then this morning I went out and guess who's now got a half-eaten box of cereal in her room hahaha why fuck",False,False
