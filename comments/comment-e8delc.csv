Like my whole body just feels so strange. It feels heavier, puffier, airier, bigger, and just... weird. It’s like I feel it doing things beneath my skin since eating more and it’s a strange feeling.   Did you experience this too? What was that like? Did it ever calm down or go away?",False,True

I was exhausted- probably because I'd been running on no food and lots of exercise before being hosptialised, so my poor body needed some time to recover from this.  Extreme hunger is definitely a thing that happens in recovery- I think megsy recovery does a video on this on youtube.  Also the bloating is very normal, your body is trying to hold onto all the nutrition it can! It definitely levels out. I was also convinced that each weight change was huge, but now that I've been getting adequate nutrition for a while, I can see that was my mind playing tricks on me.",False,False
