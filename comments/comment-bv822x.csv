After that day my life changed. Something clicked. I'm just as depressed as I 've ever been and my ed is even more of a problem than it was back then but I've had enough ups and done enough living these past seven years that I never have thoughts like that anymore. Life experience is a helluva drug.,False,False

Now I have a college degree, getting ready for professional school for a career I’m excited and passionate about that ISNT the career I thought I would pursue when I was a teen, and am married to somebody better and so much different than I could’ve imagined. I have two puppies I love so much.   OFC, my eating disorder is still here and makes life so hard but there are good days and bad days, good months and bad months, but there are always ups to make up for the downs.  I know it’s so hard but you’re alive!!! And that is so amazing and something to be proud of!! You are so strong for dealing with your disorder and pushing through last night.   Even if you can’t love yourself 100% right now just know that the strangers here care about you and your life. ❤️ if you can, do something nice for yourself that makes you feel good today. we are rooting for you!!!",False,False
