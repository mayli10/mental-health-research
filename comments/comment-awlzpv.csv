Like I just canâ€˜t restrict anymore, my body literally freaks out and gets all kinds of nervous when I try to, even just thinking about it yesterday when I made this post and contemplated low restricting today made me overeat a little last night â€žjust to taste this or that for the last timeâ€œ. I used to go three weeks full on without any food and now I canâ€™t even go a single day. Itâ€˜s so frustrating to suddenly be bad at the only think youâ€˜ve been good at for once!  Thank you for your kind words! Really needed to hear that ;)",False,True
