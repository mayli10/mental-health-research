I'm sorry, but telling your partner you're not going to speak to them to try to force them into something is completely mentally abusive. I've been in a relationship like that. Have a serious talk with him or get out of the relationship. How tf are you going to ignore your partner in a time they need you most? If he can't be there for you and be supportive to help you through it, he's not worth having around.",False,False

Explain to him that withholding affection is worse for your condition. Ask if you can make another agreement if you personally want encouragement. If you dont want encouragement, tell him you dont want punishment or reward tied to your eating.  Can you make some sort of agreement that if hes not up you just go to the gym without him and he cant be upset that you left?",False,False
