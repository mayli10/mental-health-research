It’s just a little stone with a indent you can rub your thumb over. It’s really subtle and calming. ",False,False

But have you tried a fidget toy?  I have OCD, and I sometimes lightly scratch my arms to ease anxiety. Not enough to hurt, but over time it can leave a mark. The physical sensation is calming to me but I didn’t like what it did to my skin.  My therapist suggested a fidget toy, and it didn’t really work at first, I had to try a few different types until I found one that provided a similar sensation to scratching and I had to put a little mental effort at first into reminding myself that the fidget toy wasn’t as relieving as scratching but was an excellent trade off to prevent the marks. But over time, the fidget toy started to bring almost as much relief as scratching.  It might never feel as good as rubbing your collarbones, but maybe finding something with a similar long smooth feeling you can rub when anxious might help?  Hope you find something that works for you &lt;3",False,False

Is there a healthier way to get that feeling of comfort? Bubble bath, journaling, hugging a stuffed animal?",False,False
