It was strange. I was definitely eating a surplus of calories, but my weight wouldn't budge - I even whooshed a couple times and dropped back down to 89. I freaked out and thought I broke my metabolism and started binging to gain weight. It worked in the end, but I regret it now - you should definitely take it slow to make sure the weight gain is healthy. I'm sure the target goal may seem arbitrary, but I'd trust the professionals haha",False,False
