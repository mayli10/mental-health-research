I'm an ""ecological and environmental monitoring"" intern at a remote research site in Nevada. And I'm actually studying neuroscience, but when I applied for this position, I thought I'd be majoring in more general biology.",False,True

I’m going to school for zoology and super interested in doing wildlife fieldwork. Also i’m proud of you for buying pants even though it was super hard!,False,False

You just throw on a dress like anyone else throws on jeans and everyone thinks you made such an effort...,False,False

As a girl who has lived in 1950s dresses since the age of sixteen, absolutely. I love feminine silhouettes! Full circle skirts and things that fit at the waist work with my figure so much better. And I \*carry\* myself better. At this point wearing anything else feels like being out of character.  I'm sure yours look perfect to everyone else in the world! But it's definitely the strangest feeling putting them on after so long. I bought a pair of ankle pants for my birthday and felt so suspicious wearing them outside, like people would know something was up.",False,False

It was also my ""look"" since I'm femme and you get lots of compliments for throwing on one piece of clothing if it's a nice flattering dress lol. Now I'm in a restrictive swing and my hips have slimmed down and smoothed out enough that I'm wearing athletic pants out of the house. I don't really like how I look in them but I can at least be ok with going out like that now. Those are literally the only pants I own though, no jeans, dress pants etc because it's been YEARS. I guess I'm going to have to get some eventually...",False,False

I've been living in leggings for a year and the fact that next week this goddamned heat is gonna force me to wear actual shorts and confront the number on the label makes me want to move to the North Pole,False,False
