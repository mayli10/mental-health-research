What really gets me is that she'll call me piggy after eating but call me anorexic if I don't eat (she has no clue). It sucks because it's a lose/lose situation.,False,False

The only silver lining I can see coming from this is learning how to treat my own child, whenever I have one. Sorry to anyone who is going through this; I feel your pain. ♥️",False,False

I would be eating a plate of carrots and dip then get up from the couch to add more carrots and she would say “okay - enough!”   I think it was her way of monitoring me because she thought I was binging when in fact I was not. Mothers who are ignorant of disorders are so unbelievably hard to deal with. It’s been 7 years &amp; she’s gotten slightly better with her comments but I haven’t lived with her in 5 years so I truly don’t know if she understands she shouldn’t be commenting on what I’m eating - especially if it’s a healthy snack like carrots or in your case an apple.   I think all we can do is blame it on cluelessness and try our best not to let it trigger us.,False,False
