I remember oversharing loads in the years after I regained wright because it was like this compulsion to prove what I was so that I could still hold on to it.

So it might not kill cells, but it sure makes it hard to use them. There‚Äôs a reason why a lot of restrictive ed patients have brain fog and seem ‚Äúspacey‚Äù or can‚Äôt focus on anything.

I don't feel inspired to lose as much or look at all or become as ill as she. The fact we share some thoughts and behaviors is validating to me, and her story honestly just shows me the danger and the lack of value there is in pursuing starvation, bar starving to death as a 'way out.' I think Elzani's social and cognitive development have been severely stunted - see her dependence on her mother, her child-like behavior, and how trapped in her eating disorder she still is. (Every video is about food...)   Were the body checks necessary? No. But I think the fact that she took them and posted them gives a weird sort of case study insight into her illness and how deep it goes.  She's never talked about why she thinks this started, or her mental health in general. Seeing these videos gives a different sort of context to that.",False,False

I mean I know we all deal in different ways but having a channel dedicated to it and filming yourself while crying like this is just ???

Many of us know the dangers of what we do to our bodies but we have such a warped way of seeing and thinking that even with all this knowledge we have and knowing how harmful we are being to ourselves mentally and physically is not enough to deter.

Showing pictures and video footage of her doing body checks was unnecessary - anyone looking at her face and clothed body can put together in their minds how ill she was at the time, so the gory details didn't need to be shared. She said she posted that footage as a warning to the dangers of an ED, but I don't know. She's still very ill - yes she's made a bit of progress this year (ex: fewer foods are an event, she doesn't ask her mum for assurance as much before eating etc.) but girl, some things don't need to be shared with the entire world.
