Often this means men do not have as good of a grasp of how many calories are in foods as they subsequently have more wiggle room to maintain their weight.  We are speaking in broad generalizations of course , as we all know there are also men with EDs",False,False

Normal people eat those foods too, so he might have assumed you ate other things outside of the 8-hr work shift. IIRC Panera has creamy soups that can go to what, 4-500 calories? And my bf makes oatmeal every morning with milk and a few other toppings that he sometimes has to save for later because it's a huge bowl, maybe 4-500 cals as well (he's middle of normal BMI and not super tall). Unless you tell him how much you're actually eating, or you've lost a significant amount of weight (which, again, normal people also do without losing their mind), he's probably not going to jump to the conclusion that you have issues with food",False,False

My husband doesnâ€™t notice when I lose weight and he says itâ€™s because he sees me so much, the changes arenâ€™t as visible as they are to my mom when she visits, friends I havenâ€™t seen in awhile, etc. I also feel like men in general have no concept of calories?! When I told my nutritionist I eat 2 granola bars per day he was like welp gotta keep getting those nutrients! Major eye roll. Like dude haha Iâ€™m still speechless",False,False
