That being said, I have come extremely close to passing out a few times. Even if you don't lose consciousness it's still enough to completely ruin your day. You become lightheaded, then nauseous. Next, you start to lose your balance. After that your vision blurs and you get a terrible headache. It all happens so fast and it's confusing and scary. Thankfully the only times this has happened to be me I have always been at home pushing myself to get ready for school in the morning. I'm just thankful that my apartment is so small and that I could easily throw myself onto my bed. I can't imagine how much worse it would be to go through that in public. And if I couldn't find somewhere to lie down for a while I'm sure I would lose consciousness. I almost had heat stroke in public once which I guess is pretty similar. I was heading to the mall on a particularly hot day all by myself and I guess crossing the parking lot was too much. I managed to reach a spot where there were these tiny trees which provided just enough shade to cool off in. Of course, I was right outside of a mall so some people found me pretty quickly. One guy went into the mall to get security while the other stayed with me. The two things I remember most are that I felt so awful that I was willing to drink from the one guy's water bottle and that once I got inside the mall the first place I found to sit down was on a leather couch which is not a good choice of seating for someone who's actively overheating. *~~The couch got pretty damp ngl~~* It felt so awful having to rely on strangers to take care of me.

A patient passing the door asked if he should alert the nurses, which sounds kinda ""Duh!"", but he had severe Korsakow-syndrome (I hope that's how you spell it in English - it's a type of dementia stemming from alcohol abuse), and this was beyond the level of functionality he usually had.
