They do a great job at disguising the look of the skin being bumpy. Just depends on how good your artist is. You could do a space theme on your arm and the bumps be planets.  You could always consider having them removed. It’s an outpatient procedure that they usually do in office if they’re not deep. I’ve considered having them removed before but it just wasn’t worth the money to me personally.   I could honestly give 2 fucks what other people think of me (which I know is a uncommon mindset in our community, I just hate my own body) I like to make up insane stories if people have the Gaul to ask such a rude question about my body. “ alien abduction tracker” “this is what happens when you get a vaccine” “it’s an extreme reaction to stupid people asking me inappropriate questions”   Have some fun with it! Learn to love the lumps. They ain’t goin no where",False,False

At my lowest weights you can totally just see it but I find them kind of fascinating. Like oh cool lil tumor friends. Lol that’s so fucked.   Sorry bout your lil skin marbles.,False,False
