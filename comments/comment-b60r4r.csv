I am in desperate need of a vacation and some warmth. This winter has absolutely put me through the ringer.   Bad news: WARMTH = OH GOD PLEASE NO, DON‚ÄôT MAKE ME SHOW OFF THIS ABSOLUTE BLOB OF A BODY.  I have to wear a bathing suit and shorts and I already want to die. My legs are an atrocity. The last time my parents saw me, I weighed 10 lbs less and was far more muscly.   The only consolation is that my bf knows all of this and is a total saint and is trying to convince me that I have nothing to worry about but joke‚Äôs on me, I have to buy new summer clothes again because my shorts definitely don‚Äôt fit. RIP me. ",False,False
