I have no one I can talk to about anything in real life. Not to the extent I can here. I mean yeah I go to treatment and see professionals but I canâ€™t be candid about things like I can here. This is the one place where I can be myself and come when Iâ€™m feeling any of the horrible ways Iâ€™m feeling and I know someone is going to have my back and it just helps to know that someone else understands and Iâ€™m not the only person feeling that way. If you ever need an ear, my inbox is always open. ðŸ’™",False,False

And feel like you are heard, and feel validated because that's the only thing that makes the thoughts feel more bearable. If you ever need someone to just vent at, get angry to I am happy to listen. I don't judge.   You are allowed to be scared, angry, excited, annoyed, just fucking DONE some days and that is okay.",False,False
