Only you know (or will find out) which you are. But I definitely think it's more common to NOT benefit from the cold turkey approach, and to require a slower transition. I don't know how juul works really, or how customizable it is. But maybe you should buy a more customizable rig so you control exactly how much nicotine you're getting in the chamber, and slowly reduce the percentage of nicotine vs. nic-free e-liquid over a period of weeks.   That way, you're not making your body panic over the nic deprivation, nor removing a comforting oral habit.",False,False

Repeatedly remind yourself that you are not in pain, you're not in danger, and nothing bad is going to happen because of a craving; you're just uncomfortable.  The discomfort will self-resolve pretty quickly.  Then you'll be free.",False,False
