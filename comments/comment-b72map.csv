Your mind directly coordinates with your body’s urges. If you keep thinking, man I want to eat this and this and this, you’re eventually going to start feeling hungry. You can’t rely on hunger or food cues with BED.   THIS.  SO MUCH.  ",False,False

Your mind directly coordinates with your body’s urges. If you keep thinking, man I want to eat this and this and this, you’re eventually going to start feeling hungry. You can’t rely on hunger or food cues with BED. What i found was best is regular meals, healthy but not boring, and adding a half portion of a dessert items.   It’s important to not feel like you’re limiting your food or removing whole food groups (like sweets), because that will also trigger the craving for those foods. But you also shouldn’t have access to a bunch of trigger foods. If you’re craving chocolate and want to binge, buy some dark chocolate and pre-portion it out. That way it’s healthier and still satisfies cravings. ",False,False

I havent found any tips that help, I also have bulimia but with restricting, exercise, and vom.  Anyways, a first step would be to identify times you are likely to binge. As painful as it may be to acknowledge I  writing what you binged, you may find it helpful to write when and what you ate after a binge. Identify where you are likely to binge. And identify on what foods you are likely to binge.  In terms of binge eating, part of the recovery process is following rules with your eating. But!!! Not following them so strictly that if you break one you feel like you've ruined everything and binge again.  So the main rule I've seen here is the rule of 3. After you identify where, when, and on what you binge, make sure that everytime you go to eat, at least 2/3 of these things are safe. So if you dont binge on sandwiches, having a sandwich in your office space at a time when you arent likely to binge, versus a time you are. Or something like that.  It's not an instant cure, but you didnt get this disorder overnight, so if you really challenge yourself and keep trying even if/when you relapse, you'll get results eventually",False,False

Bulimia isn't just puking, it can be heavy restriction, overexercising, lax abuse, etc. Maybe look into bulimia recovery resources instead? ",False,False
