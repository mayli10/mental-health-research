Avoid like the plague.  Their salad dressings aren't bad if you are okay with vinegar-y dressings and the mayo is all right if you use it in recipes with other stuff mixed in. The strawberry jelly is... uniquely textured... but tastes fine.   Best products of theirs are the coleslaw dressing and the pancake syrup.",False,False

And the ""chocolate"" and ""peanut"" spreads are the worst offenders.  I was tantalized by the promise of 0kcal and thought, at reading all the reviews ""How bad can it be?!"". It is THAT bad. It's even worse. It tastes nothing like chocolate/peanut.   It is too good to be true. ",False,False

I've still never made up my mind whether I like them or not, but I continue to come back to them.  In desperation, I've even swigged some straight from the bottle.  0/10 do not recommend, but it was also heavenly.    My best advice is not to make them the star of the meal.  I use the syrups in coffee, yogurt, and ice cream, where there is another flavor there to distract from the syrup.  Pancake syrup is undeniably the best.",False,False
