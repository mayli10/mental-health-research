I was at the ED Center every day from 8:30 am to 6 pm or so. We are three meals a day there. In between meals we did individual therapy, group therapy, art therapy, relaxation and yoga, etc. After a couple weeks I only went half days, then I was discharged and followed up with a nutritionist for a couple months. It was helpful. I had three years of recovery afterwards.",False,False
