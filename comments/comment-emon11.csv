But since I already want to die at all times when eating in front of other people, I'm really determined not to add a reason to make people pay attention to my eating and food choices.",False,False

(I’m sick). This is in addition to him telling me “you’re so small!” every time the family gets together. I texted my SO saying “doesn’t your whole fam know I have an ED I don’t even hide it?? Why does your brother say this kind of stuff?”. I legit have almost never hid my ED from his fam (especially his siblings) so now I’m over here wondering if I’m just sensitive or if his brother is indeed a douchebag. But yeah def don’t care anymore. I’m too tired to disguise this as anything except what it is.,False,False

I live with my parents and I used to deny it, and used to be sneaky about my restricting. I just cannot care anymore though. I don’t bother denying. I don’t make an effort to hide food that I’m not eating. I don’t dress to hide my weight loss. I literally don’t and can’t care.",False,False
