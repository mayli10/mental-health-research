I started seeing her when I was 14 and had just been diagnosed with anorexia after losing a lot and becoming UW. Now, some mornings I ate half a plain scone for breakfast before school. She told me “if you really want to lose weight, don’t do that”. Lol  The dietitians I saw when I was in the private hospital clinic were all really good though. They would challenge me, my thinking and fears, but were still compassionate and as understanding as they could be.",False,False

While maybe it works for others (do what works, I’m not bagging on it or anything). I refuse to accept it, and I told her that I didn’t wish to talk about it anymore.
