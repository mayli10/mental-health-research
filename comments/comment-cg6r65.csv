At school we'd eat lunch and have recess immediately afterwards. My teacher thought I was supposed to eat all the food my mom packed, and I had to finish it all before I could go outside. Obviously it would take forever, and a few times she caught me throwing away unfinished juice/snacks. I was to get it out of the bin and finish it (crazy bitch honestly). The food thing didn't stuck with me at the time, but the anxiety sure did.",False,False

Then I ballooned when I was 11 and comparing myself to my stick thin twin sister sent me so I started wanting to diet. I felt like everything my family was feeding me was making me fat so I fantasized about making myself thin once I moved out which is exactly what I did when I went to college... now we’re here... great,False,False

Being smaller than everyone else was one of the few things I could be proud of because I was worse off academically, super socially awkward, and I sucked at sports. I remember being *so* proud of it. I think I could do it up until 7th grade when I got too tall for it to be possible at all if I wanted to be alive.",False,False
