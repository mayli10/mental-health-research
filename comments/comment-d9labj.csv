I am super anxious, but simultaneously feel more...energized? Maybe because I actually gained some fat my body so desperately wanted. Today I even brought more food to work rather than starving myself. Granted, I think I feel MORE hungry (probably from a year of restriction, which seems like nothing considering some people deal with this for years). Baby steps.",False,False
