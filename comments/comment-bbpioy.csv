People have a tendency to choose their ED over others, and that‚Äôs not commonly recognized. It‚Äôs not even by choice as much as it becomes self preservation. I wish people handled it more delicately.",False,False

People just don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I ended a long relationship with a very good friend, and roommate at the time, because she flipped out on me and was trying to force feed me a quesadilla one night. You‚Äôre right that people just don‚Äôt know how to respond to EDs, and it can be very detrimental.",False,False

Your advice is exactly what I said but im ngl they keep making about themselves and saying how they wanna be a good friend and wanna kinda get rid of their own guilt.

Trying to explain that there‚Äôs little rationale behind it, so something that seems helpful to someone without a disorder, is complete chaos to someone who does and may send her into a spiral to regain control of her body. My bf is the only one who knows about my disorder, and he knows enough to leave it alone. He just urges me to seek therapy and do what I can to try and be better. Tell them that the most helpful thing would be to create an environment where your friend can feel comfortable confiding in them, remind her that they‚Äôre here for her for anything, and that she‚Äôs loved and cared for. ‚ÄúWhat they would want‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply when they have no idea what it‚Äôs like to be stuck in a particular mindset, though they mean well.",False,False

I'm not sure I could give a shit about popularity with the kind of person who thinks it's okay to steal someone's shit out of ""concern"".  They probably at least have good intentions, but you definitely DO know what's best here, and if they pull a stupid stunt because they're scared kids, I can't imagine her opening up about any of this for a while.  At least if you tell her, she knows she has at least one friend who won't make her regret trusting them.",False,False
