But I will say that it's also somewhat unhealthy to base your weight on your boyfriend's desires. Whatever you weigh, it should be for you - for your health, for your goals. I mean, let's say your guy gets fatally attacked by the Demogorgon next month. Let's say your next boyfriend prefers dangerously skinny girls. If you're already in the mindset of shaping your body to match the preferences of romantic partners, you're going to be very vulnerable. You know what I mean?  Many people do take their partners' personal preferences into account when making changes to their appearance, but I've just rarely seen this go well when the change has to do with weight.   Whatever happens, I wish you well!",False,False
