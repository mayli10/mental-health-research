I go on Instagram and I check the hashtag for the food I'm craving and I find 9-10 of the best photos, the ones that make me want to paw at the screen and go ""THAT! I want to eat THAT one!!!"" Then I make a photoset of those posts on the private Tumblr and go wild in the caption about why I want to eat it, what it would be like to eat it, the texture, the taste, where I would order mine from or how I would make it, just how I like it to be served, etc. etc. Then I post it and because the blog is private the only person who can see it is me.  It sounds kind of crazy and obsessive. It probably is. But it keeps me so occupied and distracted for such a long time that I don't actually binge. So crazy or not, it works.",False,False

Although yours sounds lower calorie than mine I feel so consumed, but Iâ€™m physically sick so I donâ€™t make my own food so I have to eat at least once a day and my weight loss has just stalled...",False,True

What helps me is eating MASSIVE quantities of low calorie food so I remain distracted like I just made a HUGE salad with lettuce, cucumber, corn, beetroot and some light salad cream for less than 150 cals and it took me forever to eat. My ED gets triggered by quantity (i.e. that's why I binge) idk if it's the same for you but it's helped me.",False,False
