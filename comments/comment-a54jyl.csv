The houses where I live have horrible insulation, so if typically the temperature inside matches the one outside.. my electricity bill goes WAY up in winter (and summer) because I have to have my heater on all the time *despite* covering myself in blankets. It's miserable. ",False,False

I also get super cold, the kind that soaks into your soul and never leaves. If you can, invest in high quality proper wool long underwear. The kind for hiking and skiing and all that. Also get wool socks. Make a solid layer from your neck down of proper wool. It makes a huge difference and the high quality animal fibers are way way warmer and way less thick than anything else. It is a game changer!   Sorry if everyone already figured this out lol, I only discovered this last winter so its new to me and I'm excited to share. ",False,False

I think I’m in the minority on this sub but I’d rather be cold over hot any day. Being cold means I’m succeeding. I layer up and drink tons of hot tea each day. I also can guzzle pretty much boiling water without burning my tongue which helps.   My ex would sip the tea I was guzzling and burn his mouth lol. I swear I’m just like Khaleesi from game of thrones ,False,False

The sad part about all of this is that I'm not even near my goal weight so losing more weigh = more cold. I seriously carry a space heater with me everywhere I go now because I just never know. ,False,True
