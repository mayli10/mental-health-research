I didn’t put in any amounts -&gt; just for example not my actual food logs lol   Day 1 Breakfast: nothing Lunch: nothing Dinner: homemade black bean chili, baked potato, guac, salsa, spring mix   Day 2 Breakfast: oatmeal, berries, chia seeds Lunch: nothing Dinner: rice &amp; beans &amp; spring mix with tomatoes  But as you can see I would just put the foods but no amounts so she couldn’t tell how little I was actually eating but I was honest if I skipped meals. My nutritionist &amp; I worked on finding easy meals for me to eat “on the go” because my excuse was I didn’t have time to eat enough... she made a lot of really really helpful suggestions for me &amp; I actually have a way healthier view on what I’m eating now. She may have suspected the ED but she never said anything.",False,False
