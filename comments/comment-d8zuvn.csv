It wasnt about you, you shouldnt feel bad abt it or anything— it was her own problems coming forward and projecting onto other people. Quite frankly she shouldnt be a gym instructor",False,False

Maybe I should mention that on the last session, I went with a friend of mine, who used to be skinnier than me but gained weight. When we weighed ourselves, she was heavier than me by about **11.3 kilograms** and she told me something like ""You're thinner than me, I'll kill you bich.""

That is extremely unprofessional of her. I’m a fitness instructor, and I know that eating disorders are pretty rampant in the industry, especially for fitness competitors, but that should never be encouraged or pushed on clients. There’s been a focus lately on promoting wellness in the classes, and exercise as a measure of your strength, not punishment for what you ate, so clearly this woman was not about that. I’m sorry you had that experience, that was incredibly rude of her! Did she comment on the other ladies’ weights?",False,False
