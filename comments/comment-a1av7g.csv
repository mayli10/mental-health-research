She has struggled with it for the past 30 years. I can look back now at a lot of my childhood memories and see all the signs. I thought it was normal to eat that much dessert and drink diet coke every night... Her critical comments about food and weight have stuck with me, but now I see that she was just hurting so much. She still hasn't recognized it as a problem though and refuses any help. The day before I found out about her ED, I had just introduced her to a photoshop type app where you can erase imperfections... I feel very stupid for doing that now",False,False

I just used to be more active and got away with compulsive eating a lot of very high fat foods every day, and now that I'm not as active I quickly became obese. ",False,False

I always was an average weight and I ate shitty snacks constantly. Once I moved out I was able to buy ""the foods I like"" which consisted of cookies, candy, chocolate, and everything else sugary. And then one day I made friends with this very tiny girl. We became best friends and she started saying things like ""You're going to eat that ENTIRE bag of candy?"" And then we moved in together and it got worse. We would work out together because she wanted to help me get the ""perfect"" body for cosplaying with her. I thought I was fine (I was 5'5"" 125lbs) but she constantly would bring me down and compare her body to mine. Eventually I decided she was right and I needed to lose weight and finally ended up right here with an ED thanks to her.   No, we are not friends anymore. Yes, she is an awful human being (for more reasons than just the weight thing). And now I want to make her feel bad for putting me down this path by becoming skinnier than her and seeing her at a convention one day. I know its petty and stupid but that has honestly fueled me so hard.",False,False

But for a while when I was high school, I learned about cals, discovered MFP and went straight into restriction (like 600 cals). It didn't last long obviously bc I gained more weight in college, but I never thought of that as disordered eating. It was just something I did because I was a perfectionist and was competitive with myself. I guess now I realize that my personality or traits(?) has always probably been susceptible to disordered behavior.",False,False

I'm 26 and this is completely new to me.   BUT of course there were signs. As a teen I would be so stressed from school and sneak in potato chips, chocolate and pretzels into my home and eat them while nobody was home, as fast as I could. I'd hide the empty packages under all the other trash. During college I would buy binge foods and eat as much as I could whenever I felt down or sad or thought I needed a break from everything (which was probably every week). If I had stuffed myself too much, I'd feel sick and throw up. That would happen once a month I think? I tried so many times to lose weight, but everytime I just felt like I couldn't control myself and I would give up. I even gave up being a vegetarian because I'd much rather eat a whole pack of sausages in one afternoon.  In May this year I'd decided it was finally time to put a stop to it. And for some magical reason, it worked. In three months I lost weight in a healthy, well-paced way. And then it all went to shit because I felt so stressed and I couldn't control my emotions anymore by eating because I wasn't allowed to eat mindlessly because I was losing weight. And now we're here. I stop eating when I feel the slightest stress. At night I try to eat a normal dinner, but as soon as I feel full I feel panic and I throw everything up. I can't deal with the feeling of fullness anymore, but I also can't deal with the hunger. It's a hellish place.",False,False

She was extremely thin and rarely ate. I remember the first time I went to her house, she suggested we make mac and cheese which was fine with me. I remember her saying she’d split the pot between the two of us but she served me a huge portion and only a tiny bit for herself. Something about the way she looked at me, like she was watching me, as I ate mine and she played with hers was very uncomfortable to me at the time because I could tell something was wrong but I didn’t understand what she was doing. Now I just feel sad remembering it. Now I know what it’s like to watch other people eat foods you’ve been craving, to manipulate meals through other people, to know you’re making people uncomfortable but not be able to stop because part of it is punishment for them not knowing even though you know you can’t blame them for not connecting the dots. I wonder how much she had been craving mac and cheese. I have no idea how she’s doing now.",False,False

But. I definitely had disordered eating when I was younger. I used to starve myself during the day and hide my sandwiches under my bed till they rotted (from about 11-12). I didn’t consciously think about losing weight. I just didn’t want to eat and hated feeling food in me. ,False,False

The binging got really bad in college until I was tired of being literally obese. I started losing weight in a “healthy way” until it wasn’t healthy anymore. I started being in a perpetual binge/purge cycle about a year ago at 21. ,False,False

Beyond tons of people that have outright mentioned it...My best friend moved to LA and became suuuper obsessed with being thin. She probably wasn’t eating very much and when I was with her displayed typical restriction and dysmorphia issues in passing. Example: we got drunk and she wanted to eat a snack. Her boyfriend basically said ‘you’re hungry?? Didn’t you eat enough??’ You can GUESS what was going though her mind!! She totally yelled at him and I felt bad for him because if you don’t have disordered eating that’s not something that would be super offensive. ,False,False
