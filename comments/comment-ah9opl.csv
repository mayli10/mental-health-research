You have a valid illness that needs treatment and you absolutely deserve it . Have you been on any medication before? It's not a cure all solution but the antidepressants I'm on right now are the only thing that keeps me going.   Thank you too, and I mean it when I say you deserve to get better, it's hard explaining to those who have never experienced it how much just stupid food can rule your life. I would give anything to eat like a normal person again. Hopefully someday both of us will be able to. ",False,False

To just know that I’m not alone with these struggles really helps a lot and I feel a bit better. It’s so scary to reach out and feels heart-wrenching when you’re not taken seriously, whether the response is meant well or not. I tried expressing my concerns about overeating to my mom (a recovered bulimic in remission for almost forty years now) and she calmly says I must trust my body and that with time I will learn the balance of control and release with food. Which is all very well to say but she’s also got a few decades of experience on me! I want to see my psych more regularly and see if I could see a psychiatrist for medication but I worry I’m a financial burden on health insurance and an emotional burden/too needy with my psychologist. What do you think?  Also: your honesty is refreshing and validating and I want you to know that you can DM me anytime for a safe place to rant or whatever! X",False,True

Your story sounds very similar to mine. And I'm sorry I don't really have any advice because I'm essentially stuck in the same position too. I just wanted to let you know you're not alone. I've tried reaching out for help from professionals and loved ones and no one takes me seriously and that's likely because I'm borderline overweight at this point. If you ever need someone to talk to, you can always feel free to message me. Sorry if this wasn't very helpful, I'm not great at putting thoughts into words. Stay safe ",False,False
