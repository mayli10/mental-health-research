I live in a medium city and there's not a lot of grocery stores, so I have to buy my binge food in the same places over and over again, and the panic from going to the store/being there/going through the cashier is so overwhelming that most times I just freak out and buy shit I don't even want, because I ""have"" to be quick and can't think clearly or whatever. Anyways, just wanted to say you're not alone and having that anxiety attack doesn't mean anything other than you're human and that was your reaction to the stress from this horrible situation.",False,False

I went into 7/11 and bought a pint of ice cream, pringles, and cereal bars. My obvious intention was to get home and eat it all in minutes and then go do the deed in the bathroom.   As soon as I got up to the counter, the cashier looked at my items and said ""Chunkfest time, eh?"". It was the most embarrassing moment of my life, a true reality check for me that my behavior is disgusting and there's no glamour in EDs. I put it all back and got a diet coke because I was so totally mortified.   It didn't make me stop, but I'll always remember the sneer on his face when he said it. I think that's what finally put my self-esteem in the ground for good. People are oblivious to this life, they don't think before they speak or act. I'm sure they don't mean harm but damn does it hurt. I'm so sorry you went through that.",False,False

It's okay to cry in public sometimes; we've all been there, at least I'm sure a majority of us on this sub have. I know I have many, many times as well. *It's alright.* There's nothing wrong with getting upset and crying. But when you've gotten it all out and you feel that you're ready to do something, even if that's just drive home, then do so. Then when you get home, binge some Netflix. Drink some tea. Turn the heat on, surround yourself with a bunch of pillows and snuggle under a bunch of blankets. Take a bath. And, if in the middle of all of this you still feel like crying, cry. Because it's okay to do that.   But like I said; tomorrow is not today. And it will be different than today. It may be worse or it may be better and I won't say it'll be better because I genuinely don't know. But there's the possibility that it will be and that I know for sure. Sometimes, we just need a minute to pick ourselves back up when things get complicated. Sometimes, it takes a little public crying and regrouping to get our shit back together when we lose it. And *that's okay.* I don't know if any of that was helpful or not but I really hope that it was. And if it isn't then just know that most of us here have all been where you were today before. Shit happens, man.",False,False
