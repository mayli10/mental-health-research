Being picky/ shallow to that point is indicative of far deeper problems and even if it doesn’t seem this way right now, you probably dodged a bullet.",False,False

I don’t even notice height 50% of the time, unless someone is super tall or very very short. And I actually find tallness kinda off-putting (in men, not women). I bet I’d feel differently if I were bigger, but as it stands I find gigantic dudes sorta...alarming. It’s the same nervousness you’d feel around large livestock or something lmao  Anyway I know my opinions probably won’t make you feel any better bc I ID as male, but even when I thought I was a girl, I actually preferred short dudes (and tall women, ironically).",False,False

Broke my poor 13 year old 4’7” heart.  That being said, I bought into the ideal of short girls dating tall guys. First official boyfriend was 6 feet.

Men can look like garbage (poor grooming, no style) where I live and yet I only see them holding hands with beautiful women dressed to the 9s.

To clarify, I think both sets of people are being shitty, but theres obviously a double standard here. It's like men are allowed to have preferences because they're seen as human but women aren't because they're just here for male consumption so it must be just unfair and discrimination.",False,False

Like yeah, preferences are preferences, but height is such a bullshit one because most people don't even know how to tell how tall someone is by looking at them, and will believe them when they tell them their height, even if it's not accurate. Honestly if I were a guy I'd always lie and say I was 2 inches taller than I actually was.

Height has pretty much zero influence on who I date (hypothetically maybe if they were much shorter than me but that's not too common anyway as I'm already pretty short).   Honestly what turns me on is intelligence, good conversation, humbleness, and being treated nicely. I'm even fine with going Dutch on dinner.   Now off on a tangent. . . Unfortunately being treated well has only happened to me once and then he of course ended up dumping me.   The last 2 dudes I slept with were nice to me during sex, which were totally weird experiences for me. I kept expecting a guy to finish and then fall asleep without caring about my fun or for them to get super rough (holding me down, spanking me really hard, or trying to choke me).  If we flipped this around from male height to female weight (esp on reddit) it's so socially acceptable to not want to date a woman who isnt thin *and* who has nice big boobs. It's like even when/if I lose weight I still wont have much of a chest. I only have so much to work with here and it makes me feel really sad when reddit pretty much says how easy it is for women to find partners or even just sex. Its really fucking hard for me. It makes me feel like I must be the most undesirable woman out there.",False,False
