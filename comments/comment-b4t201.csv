Last time I let myself like ‚Äúfree eat‚Äù I caught the stomach flu and so I think unconsciously I‚Äôve associated over eating with more likely to get sick (esp if I‚Äôm eating something that makes me suspicious of being poisoned) and if I eat a lot of different things there‚Äôs a bigger chance I‚Äôll get sick too. I dont know why im so afraid of getting sick but there a small part of me that thinks maybe if I start I‚Äôll never stop but also I‚Äôm just terrified of it too lol ,False,False

My ed and emetophobia go hand in hand with one another and when I‚Äôm not restricting I 10/10 times worse about my emetophobia and when I‚Äôm restricting my fear goes waaaaaay down.  ,False,False

Actually it‚Äôs really unhealthy, because a lot of what I avoid is fresh and healthy (salads, fruit, etc)  In my hardcore fear phases I‚Äôll pretty much only eat rice cakes and ironically (given your post), peanut butter. And cereal. Basically anything packaged that can‚Äôt go bad.  Idk why you haven‚Äôt gotten any responses yet but when I‚Äôve told ED friends about it they actually don‚Äôt know why ANYONE would be afraid of vomiting (no offence to those who purge!) so that‚Äôs probably a reason.
