You don't have to understand something to be sympathetic. Mental illness is not logical. I will never understand why someone with BPD or OCD or any other mental illness feels a certain way. But I can still listen to them and be there for them.",False,False

But then maybe try to find a good middle for the time being were you don't get triggered and he doesn't have to deal with trying to really comprehend your struggle (aka he doesn't talk about triggering shit and doesn't make nasty comments about what you're doing while you accept that he isn't on top of his game and can't really handle trying to understand you at a deeper level atm). For the time being, while you both try to handle life, and then you pick up this discussion again when life around you has settled a bit.",False,False

Honestly it doesn’t seem like drs get trained very well in mental health when commercial medicine is just like see and bill as many people as possible. Plus he’s currently in residency so during his very minimal time off I will get triggered by something small and then cry and feel invalidated while he’s on like no sleep and dealing w trauma from work lol. So it’s a whole thing and I know he’s trying but at the same time I’m on your side being like can u just stfu and be supportive,False,True

If he refuses be blunt about it, no backing down or beating around the bush tell him you need him to understand that you're battling something just as real as those chest pains his friggn clients have to deal with and that if can't find compassion for you because of his ""logical thinking"" he needs to sort his shit out. Does he know how EDs work? If not why isn't he reading up on it? He's a doctor yeah?  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry I just got a little wind up about him seemingly having so little empathy for what you're going through. Maybe find articles about why both logical but also emotional thinking is important both for yourself and for your relationship.",False,False

I sent him some things to read that relate to the way I feel so hopefully he can understand better. Sometimes he says things that are so insensitive but I think it’s just a combo of me being extra sensitive about food stuff and him being extra blunt. He’s a dr so he sees first hand the way people (esp Americans) can rlly fuck up their life with food so he’s judgmental of the american eating lifestyle but obv I take it personally and think he’s talking about me and not the 600 lb person who goes to the ER with chest pain,False,True

Like say an allergy, you might know that peanuts aren't actually dangerous or poisonous, other people eat them but you can't, you just can't there's an irrational mechanism going on in the body which makes it impossible for you to eat the peanuts without devastating consequences. You're not choosing to get this reaction, you can't control it.  &amp;#x200B;  It's not a perfect analogy but it might help him understand that it's not like you are ""choosing"" to feel guilty about it the same way you might decide for the carpet in your home is the wrong color.  &amp;#x200B;  Idk if you get me, it can probably be worded better bc it's not entirely true that you can't control your thinking but in the midst of the ED it feels like it. Find a way to make him understand it's not about you being logical or rational it's about being actually sick with a disorder that fucks with your mind and the way you think about food.",False,False

I love my bf and I imagine a future with him but it scares me bc I know my ED will always be lingering under the surface and I don’t know if it’s possible for me to be healthy and happy with a partner who doesn’t get it or if I’m just sabotaging myself and overthinking a good relationship. Did you go through anything like that? ❤️,False,True

He’s in software and is not-entirety-jokingly referred to as a robot. Very logical, not often driven by emotion, has zero history with mental health personally or within his family.   Honestly it wasn’t any one communication trick that solved it, it took at least two years for him to really take the time to see my way of thinking and see how certain decisions affected my behaviors/emotions. I tried to lay it out as simply as possible - I have two brains. I have both an intelligent but emotional/altered brain, as well as a straight up stupid crow brain. Crow brain sees “oooh shiny, tasty food eat food, fun thing, get thing, yum” and stomps out reason and logic in the quest for instant gratification.    Later on all those numbers and reasons and feelings about why I shouldn’t have done that can hit full force, but it’s too late to go back and undo that decision. That’s the panic - you can’t go back and make the “smarter” choice. And you know it’s not necessarily healthy to feel that panic over something like dinner, but that it’s been programmed into you and it’s going to take some work to stop letting that intense moment of fear control your feelings about things.",False,False
