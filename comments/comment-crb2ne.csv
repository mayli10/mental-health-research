I really disliked high school as well and I only keep in touch with about 4 people and my graduating class had close to 800 students. I made a lot of friends with like minded people by joining clubs. It's hard to put yourself out there but once you do it's a lot easier to make friends with people when you bond over similar interests.,False,False

Now that the new year started, you can come back to school and be whoever you want to be.

Especially if you go to college, it's much easier to find like-minded people. I tended to go to the library during lunch during hs.     Take care",False,False
