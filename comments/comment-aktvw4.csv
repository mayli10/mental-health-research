All liquids have different densities, which will impact their weight. Most water is, on average, about 8 ounces, but various additions will affect the weight.  Add that with the cup you used beig slightly off, and that's the difference.  Also, just to set your mind at ease more, the difference you mentioned is only 22 grams, out of 235!",False,False

If you used a measuring cup to weigh it out, it’s more likely the measuring cup was wrong rather than your food scale. Measuring cup sizes aren’t standardized/regulated well, so a one cup measuring cup could potentially be off by .8 ounces wrt volume.",False,False
