Think of other this way, there's a strong statistical possiblity that OP relapses when she becomes overweight and a significant life event happens. (IE boyfriend breaks up with her.) Psychiatrist knows her MD, and knows there's a strong likely hood of relapse, especially if she gets into the overweight category. It's not being overweight that's the issue, it's her reaction to it. On of the biggest indicators of a coming relapse is getting into the overweight/obese category after recovery.  ",False,False

But I just wanna note that this is OP‚Äôs psychiatrist, not her primary care doctor who would usually be the one to address the issue of body weight from an overall medical standpoint‚Äîand that she *is still in a healthy BMI range*.    Of course it can vary a lot from case to case, but many doctors aren‚Äôt necessarily too concerned with body weight in relation to otherwise (physically) healthy patients who have slightly overweight BMIs. OP is not significantly overweight. *She is not even overweight at all!!*   It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs My 600 Lb Life material. Her weight is literally normal.   So I think it‚Äôs a bit of a jump to presume she may be swinging to that kind of extreme right now (or that she may be at immediate risk of doing so or w/e), even if it‚Äôs statistically reasonable to suppose that she might.  If she had gained weight super rapidly‚Äîor if it seemed (seems) like she was (is) still gaining weight in an ED related way, or that it might otherwise be psychologically relevant and/or directly relevant to the medication(s) that the psychiatrist is prescribing‚Äîthen yeah, it could be an appropriate subject for the psychiatrist to raise in some way! Of course! I‚Äôm totally with ya there.  But that does NOT mean it‚Äôs fucking appropriate for the psychiatrist to carelessly, *rudely*, almost *jokingly* comment about it *in the literal context of OP expressing concern for her diabetic father*... ..... .....  Especially with such a terrifying, humiliating, ominous ‚Äúbe careful‚Äù kind of tone??!!!! The fuck?! So casually? So crassly?! Whipping out a damn BMI chart in that moment?! What?! That‚Äôs still kind of atrocious imho. That would be atrocious regardless.  I mean, any mental health professional worth their grain of salt should *know* that weight is *in any context* a *very* sensitive subject for *anyone* with an eating disorder/past eating disorder/history of disordered eating (obviously lol :/, to say the least :/ :/...), a subject which should be approached with extra thought and care when it really needs to be approached at all.  Imho, it‚Äôs downright irresponsible to comment about a patient‚Äôs healthy current weight in this kind of insensitive manner when they have *any* kind of  ED HX at all, not just anorexia.  For example, I know I‚Äôm sort of tentatively seeking ED treatment and have been dx‚Äôed as bulimic. I‚Äôm in ‚Äúquasi recovery‚Äù or whatever, like I‚Äôm trying (kinda) but am not quite there yet and still feel deeply conflicted, still go back and forth with myself a lot and so on... I‚Äôve gained weight I absolutely didn‚Äôt need to gain and am terrified that I‚Äôm going to end up obese again (because I actually have been obese in the past). And it‚Äôs...actually making this whole process harder...in...so many ways...  But I know I have to step back and at least *try* to obsess about my weight less for now, while I at least *try* to find some semblance of balance. At least, I‚Äôm reeally trying (and often failing) to believe my therapist when she tells me that, lol welp.  Because my purging behaviors could still easily kill me. In general, my compensatory behaviors could still easily kill me, way quicker than possibly getting fat(ter) could.   And I would 100% FREAK the fuck out if a psychiatrist spoke to me about my weight in this way, in this kind of context. Like holy fuck. A comment like that from a trusted professional could literally hinder my recovery.   There are a multitude of potential risks to consider with any individual ED patient at any given time.   I think it‚Äôs safe to say that OP‚Äôs current weight in and of itself *might* not be the most considerable one rn, you know, in terms of her actual, overall health and well being‚Äîin which case her psychiatrist should absolutely be able to discern that based on the HX and (normal!!) current weight. This psychiatrist sounds like a clueless asshole tbh.    (Sorry for the novel tho. Clearly I got way too invested in this, haha. üò¨üòÖ)",False,False

If she knows the etymology behind it. She's a professional trained in this, and unless you've previously been severely under weights (BMI below 17) then its statistically warranted.
