The whole thing was ridiculous and I’m very happy I’m out (for her sake and mine). But yeah she now has a whole room devoted to food storage and she’s 5’2” 115lbs and absolutely ripped.",False,False

I finally removed some of my hoarded items that I froze after they'd been there over a year. And that was a really big deal for me (and mainly to make room for different items...)  I literally spent last night trying to plan how I'm going to navigate my meal plan over the next two weeks to try and keep things as close to expiry date as possible. But yeah, expired food is pretty much a staple at this point....",False,True

Literally just finished stress-rearranging my cupboards so more would fit in. It also makes me stressed that I won't be able to eat it all before it expires without upping my calorie limit, which i am not going to do. But it's weirdly comforting to go to the store and get a bunch of the 'right' foods, 'just in case', and i can't stop doing it.  I have a big issue with throwing out/wasting food though, so guess who eats expired food on the regular? ALSO, i'm probably going to be moving out soon, so i should really be eating up what I have, because I won't be able to take it all with me. but..but..hoarding..",False,False
