Apparently I got the “skinny” genes from my dad’s side. Has nothing to do with the fact that a lot of them are drug addicts. 😑,False,False

So many of them are obese with related medical issues. I suspect several have BED. I developed a lot of my eating habits in direct opposition to them. And they still say I don’t understand how hard it is for them because I’m “naturally” thin.  I’ve banged my head against the wall trying to get them to eat marginally healthier. And frequently those experiences fuel my own orthorexic/restrictive behaviors. Yet I’m “naturally” thin.  Bullshit.  Family can really get into your head though. I’m starting to accept that I can’t help my family manage their weight or medical issues if they don’t want to change. And slowly learning not to let my frustration with them trigger me into behaviors that harm my own health.,False,False
