I always cave in by day 2 and have some kind of fast food which feels even worse emotionally.  I have heard quite a few people say the first few days are hardest.,False,False

Right now I distract myself by being on YouTube or doing homework and I just get really into it. First two days are difficult because you get hunger pangs and your stomach growls but by the third day it‚Äôs pretty much gone. For tea and coffee I usually only drink when I feel like it! Twice a day is what I usually end up drinking. Also, weirdly enough, cooking food for others while fasting kinda satisfies me? I don‚Äôt know if that would work for you but it works for me. Please be careful when you‚Äôre fasting! It is really not easy and to keep at it isn‚Äôt healthy at all so please take care.",False,True

When I was in my teens and early 20s, I had no problem fasting.

Now that I‚Äôm almost 30, I can‚Äôt even make it a day fasting without feeling sick enough to break the fast. I don‚Äôt know what changed. My body just can‚Äôt do it anymore.
