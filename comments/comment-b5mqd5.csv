ED habits taught me to eat a much healthier and more varied diet with plenty of fruit, veg and fibre. today i can cook something delicious, colourful, low-cal, cheap and **filling** out of fresh ingredients, which many people my age can't do. so in a way, i am thankful to my disordered eating for that.  i also learnt that there's literally no point in drinking full-calorie coke when a diet option is available. aspartame is god, amen.",False,False

The whole thing about maybe not actually being hungry and just confusing what you’re feeling for dehydration/thirst is absolutely true.

I’ve recently really found that a more keto-leaning diet works really well for making me feel more full on less calories.  So high protein and high fat.  It does mean that when I’m in that mindset, I end up eating less volume because fats are super calorie dense, and the combo of fats and proteins make you feel more full for longer.  Most of the fat I try to intake comes from eggs and oils like olive oil and sesame oil.  My instinct and habits lean towards super low fat though, because I trained myself to fear fat (due to the dense calories), so I automatically reach for low fat or fat free options at the grocery store.  I am working on transitioning to the keto-leaning diet though because I feel so much better and more satiated despite the lower volume of food.  I don’t think it’s a good idea to cut out carbs entirely because it’s not sustainable.  Several influencers I follow who endorse the keto diet have admitted that they usually can’t go more than a few months on keto.

I've checked the nutritional information for a bunch of common superfoods like kale and stuff and they tend to be less healthy than similar foods. For example, spinach is way better than kale. You don't need to eat as much to get the same nutritional content and it's also more widely available while also costing less.  I know that there are other factors to consider besides nutritional value, but nutrients are far more important and most of the things that get a food labelled as a superfood have never actually been proven to be true. And all natural foods are thought to have health benefits of some sort. Even things like red meat are believed to have a positive impact on your body despite all the negatives being pushed by recent research. At least if you focus on eating a healthy mix of all the nutrients you need you can get proven benefits that absolutely will happen to you. Like we know that potassium is good for brain and muscle health. We know that calcium is good for bone health. Vitamin D is pretty much a cureall for people who don't get enough of it. Then on top of all the stuff we know for sure there are just as many unproven benefits to nutrients as there are to specific foods.  Also, labeling a food as organic means nothing. All food is organic. All fruits and vegetables are also GMOs. Humans have been selectively breeding and inter-breeding crops for generations.

I can now look at different fad diets and tell you right off if they hold any water.

Also, due to me doing strength training while restricting, I have full knowledge of what VEGETARIAN foods can give you the most bang for your buck.  Example, a serving of nonfat Greek yogurt actually has MORE protein than a serving of tofu.  Crazy, right?? And fat-free cottage cheese also has a higher protein to calorie ratio than tofu.  Beans are not as high in protein as you’d think, and actually contain a surprising amount of carbs.  Egg whites technically are a great source of protein, but unless you get the cartons of egg white (which are expensive) it’s a huge pain to crack and separate enough eggs to get enough egg whites for a decent amount of protein, not to mention the huge waste of egg yolk.  So while eggs are a decent source of protein, you also gotta take into consideration the amount of fat that’s contained in the yolk.
