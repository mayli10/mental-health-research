It sounds like one of those “more at 11” news teasers where the true complete story turns out to be far less frightening.    In nutrition studies I have many questions...how were data collected, what were the demographics of participants, how were other variables controlled for, is the presentation of results using statistics to make things seem more dramatic than warranted. (Eg. a 200% increase can be a tiny increase in raw numbers.)",False,False
