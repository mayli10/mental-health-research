When we exercise, it creates tiny tears in our muscles. The muscles tell our body, ‚ÄúHey, I need some help over here!‚Äù and the body sends nutrients to the damaged muscle tissue to help repair it. So, since your body needs a little extra water and nutrients that you‚Äôd normally pee out as unnecessary excess, you gain a little bit of weight. 5-10 pounds after a seriously intense workout or multiple workouts is standard. When your muscles heal, it‚Äôll release that extra fluid and nutrients and you‚Äôll pee it right out. Then you‚Äôll have built stronger muscles that increase your metabolism and make you look leaner!   Keep hydrated, eat protein, get enough sleep, and try to do some light exercise like stretching or walking to help your muscles recover quicker. üíï",False,False
