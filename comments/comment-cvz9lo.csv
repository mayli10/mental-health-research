First of all, beauty comes in all shades and that’s a FACT. There are so many gorgeous dark skinned women out there it’s insane!  Secondly, if the guy you’re sleeping with wouldn’t consider dating you stop sleeping with him, period. You’re hurt and he’s the reason so why should he benefit from it at your expense? Lastly, I wish I could give you useful advice on your Ed, but seeing as I can’t manage my own I’d be no help. All I can say is that we’re our own harshest critics. I’ve always felt that same way, that I’ll never be pretty, but that’s just my mean Ed brain messing with me. Try to do something nice for yourself- do your nails, fix your hair- and give yourself a break. You’re beautiful because of who you are, so appreciate your assets and forgive your flaws as often as possible. Confidence is always in style ❤️",False,False
