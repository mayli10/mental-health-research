I said I was currently in recovery and only purge once the last month, and she was really glad. I could cry she was so sweet and understanding. she said the erosion right now to is only to the back of my front teeth and is minimal and as long as I\u2019m in treatment and getting better it will be fine. She gave me a whole thing with a checklist with harm reduction techniques and did a free fluoride treatment to help strengthen my teeth. I\u2019m sure everyone here has heard all the tips a hundred times so I hope you all find a dentist as understanding and helpful.",

My one source of comfort during the day. The local drive through SBs has gotten it wrong on occasion, leading to a lot of tears etc.\n\nA few months ago, he explained to the woman whilst waiting that I had pretty severe AN, hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect, otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me. She sympathised and said she'd watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder, but thankfully she hasn't spiraled too far.\n\nAnyway, now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart, and why it has to be so specific. He was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink, who know how & why, because they don't want to upset me and want to make sure it's always correct. He came home and had the above message written on my cup, and it just really made my day. It was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are, and understanding.\n\nSorry for the ramble, I just have nobody to share this with and I found it really sweet \ud83d\ude1e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Thank you everyone, I forwarded on the comments to my dad & will also write to SB to name the branch & hopefully they'll get some worthy praise <3\n\nAlso, my dad has been incredible. He has Asperger's, but the lengths he goes to to empathize with me is something I'll always be thankful for - sadly we've both had to go through this disordered journey over the past year or so, but he's very supportive. As stated, I forwarded on everyone's compliments :)",

He went from dancing with his wife of 57 years at his eldest grandson's wedding to being dead in less than five minutes. I still can't fucking believe it.\n\nMy brain is still short circuiting a bit but one thing is abundantly clear to me in light of this: why the FUCK does one goddamn number on a goddamn machine matter so much to me? It is irrelevant. IRRELEVANT.\n\nDuring our ceremony we had our officiant read out this quote: *\"One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life. That word is love.\"* I don't care if it sounds cheesy or trite because it's the truth.\n\nI'm going on a mini honeymoon with my husband tomorrow for a few days before the funeral at the end of the week. We're staying in a beautiful national park and we're going to spoil ourselves on fancy dinners and ice cream and whatever the fuck else we want. He is what matters the most in the world to me. Not my weight or how many calories I've eaten in a day or how many steps I've walked or hours I've exercised. Real life matters, with all its pain and wonder and love and sadness and everything else in between.",

        "Text": "When I was fat a boy called me a beached whale in front of our sports class. The teacher told him to settle down as I felt my cheeks burn. \n\nWhen I was fat a  \u201cfriend\u201d jiggled my double chin and said if I just lost weight I could be pretty. She told me my chubby cheeks made me look like a squirrel when I smiled. It took me a long time to learn to love my smile again after that. \n\nWhen I was fat my dad asked me where he went wrong as a parent. How could my brother be so athletic while I ballooned each year in this household where carbs were practically a reincarnation of the devil himself? When he found the empty ice cream containers and chocolate wrappers he told me I was disgusting. He said he was embarrassed to tell people I was his daughter. \n\nWhen I was fat I bought an expensive jumpsuit for a big upcoming party. I spent hours perfecting my hair and makeup, I squeezed into heels so that my legs could look long. When I got there the boy I liked looked me up and down, turned to his friend and  loudly whispered \u201cfat b****\u201d. They laughed and left and I wished I could fall through the floor. When I got home that night I cried because I was a shy nerdy girl and I couldn\u2019t imagine what I had done to make him say that. \n\nI thought I used food to control my emotions but really I was controlled by food. \n\nEvery night when my family had gone to sleep I\u2019d pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed. I\u2019d buy it after school from the grocery store, a different one each time because I feared the cashiers would recognise me and see exactly where all this food went - my cheeks, my waist, my thighs. \n\nI\u2019d stuff my face until my stomach ached and the nausea crept up my throat and I was sure I had abused myself enough to truely be the beast people told me I was. \n\nOver the past year I\u2019ve lost enough weight to now be on the low side of a healthy BMI. I\u2019ve basically switched to a restriction ED, largely driven by the comments of people around me. \n\nAnd today the boy who called me a \u201dfat b****\u201d asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other. He said I looked great and he wondered why we didn\u2019t talk more in high school. I wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem. I wanted him to know how many nights I had spent crying over his careless words. But instead smiled and said I was happier leaving the past in the past.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I wrote this, I guess I\u2019m just frustrated with how the world works. I wish I could have enjoyed high school, I wish people could have seen more to me than just my weight, I wish I didn\u2019t think about food constantly. Oh well",

Not in a safe place? If you\u2019re going to eat, it has to be a safe food and at a safe time. Not eating a safe food? You bet your ass you have to eat it in a safe place and at a safe time!!! As long as 2/3 are safe - challenge yourself with something NOT safe. \n\nNot only does this encourage eating non-safe foods in a healthy way, it really helps deflect a binge if you stick to it. \n\nI hope this helps y\u2019all as much as it\u2019s been helping me!!

Our BMI isn't measured by whether you find us bangable or not.\n\nSo freaking tired of seeing visibly underweight bodies treated as \"average\"/healthy/\"you're just used to overweight bodies because America blah blah blah\"\n\nI like how it looks too, can't help it, but I'm not deluding myself that Natalia Dyer isn't vastly underweight because I think she's pretty. (Edit to clarify: she's just a common Reddit example, not my current gripe). Strange how I've never seen gay/bi women do this? \n\nSorry to rant, just urgh.

        "Text": "I'm not trying to be a downer or anything but I just wanted to hop on here and vent because I've had varying eating disorders over the years. When I was anorexic I started recovering and ate \"a lot\" and \"whatever I wanted\" and didn't gain crazy amounts of weight because I was eating about 1600 calories a day and that was crazy for me. But once I started binge-eating I could literally eat 5000 calories on what makes me feel \"full\" and \"what I wanted.\"\n\nI just want to shout out all the people on this forum with binge eating tendencies who literally can't commit to that sort of eating without spiraling down into deeper depression and self-hatred, and who are stuck between crazy restricting and having to still track at maintenance to \"recover\" and learn how to eat again.\n\nWhen I was 15 I tried to recover by following the advice of \"you won't get fat if you just eat what you want,\" gained 20lbs, and started self harming because I hated myself so much. It doesn't work for everyone and that's my ted talk.\n\n\\*Edit: This blew up and so many of you commented how you agree and I just wanted to add that I think we need to stop perpetuating stereotypes within our own community about what recovery looks like for everyone. For some people it's weighing their food and losing weight, for others it's listening to their hunger. I think we all need to realize that our personal eating disorder experience isn't like everyone, and just because something works for YOU doesn't mean it will for someone else. And that's on the controversial for today!",

Restrict all you want and nobody will worry as long as you're not an obvious bag of bones, in fact, they'll just think you're vain and stuck-up, or applaud you for being so 'healthy'. Nobody gives a fuck about making you uncomfortable with constant comments and jibes about your body, so why should you care about potentially making them feel like assholes?\n\nI announced today at work that I was going out to get some lunch. A female colleague snidely remarked \"I thought you only ate one meal a day!\". I told her that in fact I was not going to eat, and only said that I was to shut her up because she couldn't keep her mouth shut for five seconds about my eating habits. For once, she had nothing to say.",

It's heartbreaking how many of us gone through this. I have. I know that's the way we tend to see it, that we intentionally sought this out. But did we?\n\nIn my opinion? No. We didn't. Because normal, neurotypical people don't sit and think \"yeah I'm going to get an eating disorder today\". They don't stumble upon pro ana blogs and think \"wish I could be like that\". They find it sad and strange.\n\nYou have a predisposition in the first place. EDs are more than a way of eating and a body type to worship; it's trauma, psychology, socialization, body image... So much more than downloading Tumblr and deciding to fast.\n\nIf you think you're less valid, or that you're a wannarexic, that you gave yourself this disorder, just know that you're not a fake. Your struggle is real. It's not your fault.",

I said I wished I could pet a cat because I was so stressed from school. So then we stopped at pet smart to \"pet the cats\". As we were walking inside, my boyfriend said \"I hate cats, so we are not getting one. We are only petting them. This is a de-stress trip to pet cats and that is it.\"\n\nWithin 5 minutes of \"petting the cats\" my boyfriend was hand selected by a big fat male tabby who stuck his paw through the cage and gently tapped him on the ear. I look over a few minutes later and he has this big cat cradled in his arms, telling me we have to have him. \n\nSo now we have a cat. And it's been 3 days and we never returned to the grocery store for the junk food run. \n\nAnd I'm thankful for this because now I get to go to the grocery store by myself today and select all the good and healthy foods I want without his influence \ud83d\ude0d\n\n..I was literally saved from junk food by [this cat](http://imgur.com/a/5k8mAyU)\n\n*edited to add photo",

It\u2019s the only support or community they have for help and questions. \n\nAnd yes we can argue people should look for posts before they post their own post to avoid repetitive posts, but honestly, I don\u2019t mind at all. Often we are not in the right frame of mind to look through posts. We are freaking out and need quick reassurance, an answer or to vent right now. If people are restricting, sometimes the concentration needed to read through prior posts just isn\u2019t there. \n\nLet people freak out about weight gain even if we all know it\u2019s water weight. Let people ask if others fee invalid. Most of us just want quick connection and validation. Just somewhere where we can give a voice to the ED part of us that needs help. \n\nSo I just love every post and every post is valid (except trolls of course). In my opinion, ask away, rant away, post away...\u2764\ufe0f\n\nP.s sorry for the clickbait title lmao",

        "Text": "One of my (20F) guy friends was having a hard time today. The dude is like 6\u20192, incredibly handsome, works out, studies engineering, amazing teeth and energy, but still struggles with self esteem, BAD. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m always blown away when he says something about feeling ugly because I tell no jokes when I say this man is a solid 9.5/10 by universal  standards. I was listing off all the attractive qualities about him in an attempt to make him feel better (like that EVER works with anybody), and he finally breaks: tells me he grew up really chubby and got thin in the beginning by severely restricting food. Even after losing the weight and seeing how people treated him differently he couldn\u2019t shake the vision of himself he formed as a kid: fat, ugly, unloveable. If anything, \u201cglowing up\u201d made him more insecure. I understood exactly what he meant. \n\nI grew up with cystic acne, chubby, awkward. I had no friends, nobody took me seriously, nobody saw me. Cue my junior year of high school, an eating disorder, platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity, kindness, respect and attention. I saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it, no matter the cost on my physical and mental health, and it proved 100% of my fears about people treating me badly because I was \u201cugly\u201d. \n\nMy friend and I both agreed that \u201cglowing up\u201d didn\u2019t make us any more confident: in fact, it made us more paranoid and kinda justified our bad ED behavior. We know what it\u2019s like to be \u201cugly\u201d, and we know how much better life treats you when you\u2019re thin and \u201cpretty\u201d.  We\u2019ll do anything not to go back, and we\u2019re constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it. That we\u2019re \u201cfat\u201d again. We know it happened once and know that it could happen again. \n\nBoth of us know that in reality our version of \u201cfat\u201d is probably closer to healthy, and don\u2019t judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards. Can anyone else relate??\n\nEdit: typo, and thanks for the gold friend <3\n\nEdit 2: Wow, thank you all so much for sharing your stories and being so supportive. My friend and I have been reading through all the comments as they come, and we both agree that\u2019s it\u2019s been so awesome and validating to see how many of us went through similar situations.

I\u2019m a bisexual bitch and these replies lowkey make me feel affirmed and not alone but also very sad because all of YALL  are beautiful and if I saw you naked I would get after it on god (but obviously it\u2019s harder to think those jazzy positive thoughts about ourselves duh)",

Unlike many here, I never fit in with the absentee period crowd (tho I know that is just as dangerous). I had the eternal periods. For example: from sept 2018 to sept 2019 alone I bled for 236 days. \n\nI'd tried every birth control under the sun. And almost all of them made my migraines worse. I've seen specialists I have had two surgeries already (endometriosis), had all sorts of tests and imaging and have done my own research for what seems like forever.\n\nI've been so anemic I could not leave my house to go for a walk. I was a shadow of myself, a depressed shell. \n\nAll this bleeding exacerbated my ED. Between trying to restrict to lose my period, to depression eating. I have been so incredibly unhappy with my body. I felt like it was rebelling against me at every turn.  [MOOD](https://i.imgur.com/w2r50B3.gif)\n\nBut not anymore. I may be exhausted, bloated from all the air they pumped into me, in pain and afraid to take a deep breath or to go poop (lol)...but I am free. \n\nI'm making an effort to eat what I need to heal. My dumb fuckin lizard brain is having to take a backseat. I refuse to let this monster jeopardize my health and healing damnit.\n\nBut really I'm just so happy to be done with this horrible chapter. And I dunno if anyone here has suffered the same bleeding issues or has ever had or considered a hysterectomy; but I'm here if you have questions. \n\nAnyway thanks to anyone who read this. And thanks for letting me share. \n\nMuch love.",

You _are_ 100% losing fat/muscle but the extra water might make the scale not move.\n\nOr\n\nYou eat 500kcal per day but that's way too little (obviously) and longer term restriction has caused your intestines to slow down significantly. You haven't let out any of that indigestible shit(heh) and it basically weighs as much as your food. You're losing fat/muscle but your scale won't move.\n\nThat's all.\n\nCalories are all that matters and if you're eating an impossibly unhealthily small amount of food you're 1000% losing weight. The scale is just not the best arbitur for what you're losing in those two scenarios. \n. \nYou can probably do the math and see what you lost in true weight if you're a NERD like me (it's actually surprisingly accurate considering a 100kcal lower tdee since I'm UW and has probably caused my thyroid to not work well oh and up to 200 less if you've lost your period)",

        "Text": "I was dreading coming home for the holidays because I knew how blunt my parents would be regarding my weight. I\u2019ve gained 20lbs in the past year. \n\nWhen I came home for break last winter I\u2019d been at my lowest weight and was restricting below 500; my friends convinced me to tell my therapist, who sent me to a nutritionist on campus and pushed me to refeed. I let myself eat regularly over the summer, which I didn\u2019t spend at home, and kept it up into this past semester. And now I\u2019m relapsing hard and trying to lose weight again.\n\nThe first thing my dad said to me when I stepped into the house was, \u201cYou need to start losing weight. It\u2019s unhealthy to be this fat.\u201d (I\u2019m in normal BMI range for my height by a long shot.) My mom comments at least once every few hours about how much fatter I look and how, \u201cYou don\u2019t fit into your old pants, do you?\u201d While eating dinner on my first day back, they ordered Papa John\u2019s pizza & wings and said, \u201cShe eats so well, no wonder she\u2019s gained so much weight.\u201d We\u2019d just spent the whole day moving into our new house.\n\nI spend my breaks working at my dad\u2019s sushi restaurant, which is mostly staffed by older Korean adults. Every. Single. Damn. Day. Someone assumes they have the right to make some fucking comment about how much weight I\u2019ve gained. Shit like, \u201cI guess you just gain more and more weight each time we see you?\u201d and \u201cLook at her, she\u2019s so chubby these days.\u201d \n\nYesterday while at work, I had a complete mental breakdown in public. I was trying not to cry behind the host stand. My dad came over to ask what was wrong and I just fucking broke down in front of him. I told him how every single time anybody sees me they make comments about how fat I am and how much it fucking hurts. I promised him through my tears and rage that I\u2019d stop eating for fucking good if that\u2019s what everyone wanted from me. One of the sushi chefs, who\u2019d commented just a few minutes prior, came over to apologize (I didn\u2019t respond). I was wiping tears away while giving takeout orders to UberEats drivers and showing customers to their seats. It was fucking humiliating.\n\nThis is all just to say, Asian (particularly Korean) culture regarding weight is so. Fucking. Toxic. Everyone thinks they have the right to say something that could be hurtful to anybody to me just because \u201cwe\u2019re friends\u201d and they don\u2019t give a fuck about mental illnesses. My family members have called me fat for as long as I can fucking remember, as I\u2019ve always been a chubby kid. They compare me to my younger sister, who is 5 years younger than me, hasn\u2019t fully gone through puberty yet, and was blessed with amazing genes. I\u2019ve fucking had enough. I\u2019ve never felt so motivated in my life to get as sick as I possibly can. When I hit my ugw and I\u2019m withering away to nothing but bones and depression, they\u2019ll eat their fucking words and regret everything.\n\nAnd they wonder why I have an eating disorder.\n\nedit: everyone here is so damn lovely and supportive. You didn\u2019t have to gild this, but thank you so much and thank you to everyone who\u2019s left a comment. It means so so much to me that there\u2019s a community out there for me in which I can find comfort when my family and friends turn their backs on me.\n\nI hope everyone had a great holidays and is staying safe. \ud83d\udc93",

If only you knew that, right after I left the shop, I would take these donuts to my strategically parked car and eat almost every single one of these, by myself and in a single sitting, until I was writhing in severe pain so bad that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to drive away until my body actually got some time to digest some of the food. If only you knew, that no, I wasn\u2019t just hungry; I was fucking famished to drown my agony in donuts, even despite the fact that I did the same thing last night as well.\n\nIf you knew, you probably wouldn\u2019t be laughing at your own joke anymore. You would probably be mortified at your own words, disgusted at the behavior, and sympathetic toward me.\n\nIf only you knew..\n\nBut that\u2019s okay. You didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I laughed are your comment too. That\u2019s why, in my eyes, you\u2019re sweet. You probably thought I was taking these donuts to my friends or family, talking and laughing in between bites of these pockets of saccharine goodness. You probably thought there was no way a 5\u20192 girl would ever possibly eat all of these on her own; maybe if I were 300 lbs, you wouldn\u2019t have said such a comment. But that\u2019s okay, because from the outside, it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m suffering from an eating disorder, so there\u2019s no way you could possibly know.\n\nTo the sweet, old man at the donut shop, I hope you enjoy that single donut that you purchased yourself and remember me as the girl who laughed at your joke and bought donuts to share with others. I wouldn\u2019t want to burden your day with my issues; I want you to remain comfortable enough to continue joking with strangers. I don\u2019t want you to know.\n___\n\nEDIT: I can\u2019t believe I got so many compliments on my writing. I literally whipped this up randomly and quickly as I was waiting for my food to digest a little before I could drive away from the parking lot after that binge, and I wasn\u2019t expecting this kind of response at all. I can get a bit insecure about my writing, and these comments honestly made me absolutely delighted. Like, maybe I\u2019m not such a worthless loser lol..Now...if only I could believe people in the same manner when they actually call me pretty or not fat lmao",

Most of the taxi drivers around here are moody, but I had a very chatty lady. \n\nWe talked about loads of things (including our hatred of full fat milk).\n\nI told her I was a psychology student. \n\nShe said \u2018oh, are you going here for a work placement?\u2019 And I\u2019m like \u2018nah, I have an appointment lol\u2019\n\nHer response was: \u2018oh, I used to get treatment from *name of ED section*\u2019 and I was like \u2018THAS WHERE IM GOING\u2019\n\nWe the bonded over anorexia experiences. \n\nNow, to reiterate, I\u2019m a 19 year old anorexic psychology student, this was a 50 year old anorexic taxi driver. \n\nShe ended up telling me how she used to do (something related to sports? I can\u2019t remember exactly what it was). \n\nUnfortunately, she kept getting injuries so she\u2019s been a taxi driver for the last 20 years. She\u2019s recently started doing a beauty course but she was worried she was too old. So we gave each other pep talks and were being really positive and talking about citalopram (what she\u2019s on) and fluoxetine (what I\u2019m on) and it was overall exactly what I needed before goiing to a scary ED appointment on my own. I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot and I genuinely wish the best for her. She was so sweet. \n\nIt\u2019s a long shot, but if this lady is on ED reddit, just wanna say thank-you for making my day :)",

I was so happy and my body felt great as I was becoming less bloated from my binge yesterday. But than I sat down to watch the new South Park episode (which was funny as usual) and literally ate three poptarts :( \n\nI feel so gross and like a failure. I wish I could stop binging. Back in February, I was restricting and purging with ease and I got down to my lowest weight. But after a suicide attempt, I began to binge and I stopped purging so I wouldn\u2019t damage my singing voice. I have periods of restriction but only for a week at most. I haven\u2019t gained much weight (11 lbs) due to having a fast metabolism but I feel so fucking worthless.",

People say they like \u201cthick\u201d women, but what they really mean is tiny waist and skinny everything except for boobs and butt. This body ideal is even harder to achieve, in my opinion, because you can\u2019t get it through just dieting. It\u2019s arguable that no amount of exercise can help you get it either, it\u2019s mostly just good genetics. \n\nThen with an actual thick girl, she\u2019ll be called fat and be told to lose weight. It\u2019s ridiculous. And a skinny girl will be called flat and told to eat a burger. It\u2019s exhausting that body standards don\u2019t cater to majority of the population and most likely never will.",

This sub and the love from all of you posting and responding to each other has kept me on track to recovery better than my therapist.\n\nIm still newly \"in recovery\" I think, but this has been my longest, healthiest bout (36 days now compared to 3-5 day binge cycles my whole life). I wanted to share what I think of as my \"secret to success\" just in case it works on a single other person.\n\nThe goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego, Skinny Cool Girl. \n\nSCG is basically my imaginary role model, who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist.\n\nI wasnt doing so well on the hot part. Body dysmorphia or not I'm still not sure, but damn it I want to be SCG!\n\nSo I decided to...start something *else* SCG does (besides look good). To start rock climbing. To get my first tattoo. To start hiking. To try a kickboxing class. To go out with friends. I just went \"skinny dipping,\" no pun intended. My next step is to go dancing for the first time. I'm planning a backpacking trip for next summer. I'm going to class so I can get the degree SCG has.\n\nSCG doesnt like everything she tries, but she tries anything. And she doesnt wait for other people to suggest things, she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out.\n\nBasically *I* dont want to do those things, but SCG does. And I want to be SCG. So I go, and I have had a great time and maybe I'm getting a little bit closer to being her.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: who will you be when you are YOUR Skinny Cool Girl? Will you go skydiving? Will you sing karaoke? Will you dress in bright bold clothes? Will you flirt with someone? Will you eat balanced meals, or apply for a better job? Will you perform or display your art? Will you go to bed on time?\n\nWhat leap will you take someday in order to become her? When will she do *insert activity here* for the first time?\n\nCan you make it happen now?\n\nTake one of the things future SCG has about her that you dont have, that isn't weight related, and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment.\n\nThe brain, your soul, who you want to be does not change after you lose weight. Go be her. You have to *become* her still. Weight is only a small part of the equation. You'll catch up to SCG. Dont waste time while you think you're fat not being cool girl, or else you'll lose the weight and find out that SCG doesn't exist yet.",

That is too little calorie, I tell my 600lb patients to eat more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You didn't get enough protein today, that's why you have headache and feel weak.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your heart rate dropping again.

Even if someone was lying, why would I care? It's not like treatment is even easy to get in the first place, so no one is taking \"my\" spot. No one is undermining my pain, I'm quite able to do that on my own.\n\nIf anything, this gatekeeping only feeds into my ED. I feel like if I ever show any signs of normalcy, I won't be able to say that I'm sick anymore. Accepting that EDs are varied and show up in all sort of ways is actually **protecting** the sufferers. But those fuckers goaling for 18.5 BMI like it's normal (it's still healthy you guise 111!1!!!!) and eating low-cal bullshit making me feel like failure for not dying yet is SO HELPFUL, right?  \n\n\nTLDR; normies don't know shit about us, I love you and would protect any of you with my tiny twig arms if I could.

If wearing a yellow shirt made you 18x more likely to develop a serious illness, would you do it??\u201d \n\n\nCan we say, victim blaming?! False equivalency?? \n\n\nA better analogy would be - wearing that yellow shirt is strongly encouraged by all celebrities. They all wear yellow shirts, and they SWEAR none of them get sick! \n\n\nIt\u2019s glamorous to wear a yellow shirt, and when you try on the shirt for the first time, everyone tells you how amazing it looks on you. So much better than those other shirts you wear. \n\n\nNow you don\u2019t want to take the shirt off, but it\u2019s making you sick. So you try wearing a black shirt but you miss the attention and adulation. You hate how the black shirt makes you look. So you convince yourself you can be like those girls who wear the yellow shirts and never get sick... but we all know how that story ends. \n\n\n\nDiets are not the factor here. The influences that make us want to diet are the factor. I understand the intention is good but this oversimplification is incorrect and frankly quite insulting \ud83d\ude11",

Look, she still has boobs. Underweight women don't have boobs.*\n\nLike, mate. I'm not calling you a dickhead or anything. I'm just saying she's almost certainly not healthy or at the very least eats a severely restricted diet to get to where she is. I'm smaller than 99% of the women I've pointed out, I know what underweight looks like.\n\nIt's fine to think she's hot. I think she's hot. Why can't they just acknowledge it's not achievable for their wife/girlfriend to look like that without starving themselves to some extent? It's like they're insistent on considering women lazy unless they uphold an ideal that is physically dangerous to get to.",

I thought none of my clothing would fit me, that my stomach would become huge, that everyone who praised me for my weight loss would notice that I\u2019ve gained weight. \n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen. Instead, I just stopped feeling light headed, hungry, and obsessive all the time. I still look the exact same, I\u2019m just not ravenously hungry all the time. The size small skirt that I bought during the summer still fits, my t shirts are still baggy, and I haven\u2019t mysteriously formed a double chin. \n\nAnd neither will you. You will not gain 100 lbs, you will not lose control over your body, and your clothing will still fit you fine. You will be absolutely fine.",

I asked her if I should be more forward with the guy I was there with as I had a major crush on him, she said yeah and he became my boyfriend shortly after. \n\nWe swapped Instagram's and after that night out I noticed what a sKiNnY lEgEnD she was becoming and how aesthetic her account was. Then I started to get worried for her because she seemed to get into very dangerous territory, she was so tiny. I'm one of them who looks 'normal' weight despite multiple ED patterns so it kind of hit me how fast she had gone so tiny, especially as my ED patterns started about the same time I met her and she was almost normal weight when we met.\n\nAnyway, she did a post the other day saying she'd just got out of a clinic & that she's getting better. Even though she's essentially a stranger I'm so proud of her! I wish her a healthy future. \n\n<3",

        "Text": "These are the kind of \"tips n tricks\" that matter- \n\n- NEVER brush your teeth right after purging. Wait AT LEAST a half hour, but preferably more, because the motion will erode the enamel that's been softened by recent exposure to acid. Instead... \n\n- Swish your mouth with plain water as many times as you can stand, then suck on a mint or chew some gum. Salivary flow will help get protect your teeth from any remaining acid. \n\n- Buy a sensitivity toothpaste. Even if they aren't sensitive yet, someday I promise they will be if you don't protect your enamel with the right products. These are designed to protect your enamel better than others, and from my experience, they actually work. \n\n- Use a children's mouthwash. These have a much higher fluoride content (which is often entirely absent in regular mouthwashes). Fluoride is vital in protecting enamel from acid erosion. Since I started using it my teeth are wayyyy less translucent. \n\n- If you're comfortable doing so, tell your dentist. They can prescribe medical-grade products and insurance will most likely cover it. \n\n- Avoid binging on highly acidic things and/or very sugary things (though I know those are often the most tempting). The prolonged exposure (as binges generally last a while) can cause problems all by itself. \n\n- From a darling commenter- chew tums when you're done! It'll neutralize the acid. That's it's job! \n\nThat's all I've got for now but if I remember anything else I'll come back and add it. \n\nTake care of yourself, dear. You (and your teeth \ud83d\ude09) matter. ",

Out of all those diagnoses, the only one that people literally don't even bother to try to understand is the anorexia. Most people are extremely empathetic about the PTSD and anxiety, and while bipolar is misunderstood sometimes, people don't make as many ignorant comments about it as they do my ED. And when I explain the brain chemistry behind the mental illness, they get it. \n\nBut I've got good friends of mine who I have told time after time about my struggles with ED over this relapse the last 4 months and they continually just don't get it. At all. Why is that? Why is it so difficult for people to empathize with EDs? My friends who don't have alcoholism somehow still manage not to say triggering stuff about that and can respect my boundaries, and they get that being an addict isn't a choice, but something I have to manage regardless. My friends who don't have anxiety are still capable of comforting me during a panic attack. My friends who don't have PTSD understand why seeing a man who assaulted me in public can cause me to spiral. My friends without bipolar may have never experienced mania or suicidal depression, but they believe me when I say I am miserable and in pain. Yet, when I confide in people about my ED, it's always the same sorts of things, over and over. \n\n\"Well you don't look bad, you still look healthy\"\n\n\"I mean, 800 calories a day isn't that little, just try eating a bit more between meals\"\n\n\"Purging is nasty\"\n\n\"oh yeah, I didn't eat like anything today either, I just wasn't hungry\"\n\nRANT INCOMING\n\n1. People do not understand the serious medical implications of struggling with an eating disorder, particularly when it comes to long term restriction and purging. You do not have to be 70 lbs to die of an eating disorder. \n2. Why do people need physical \"evidence\" of an eating disorder being bad before they give a shit? No one needed evidence when I relapsed into drinking, My grades were still perfect and I drank alone so people didn't see, but when I told people I was miserably drinking myself into a hole every night, they believed me. No one said some ignorant shit like \"well you're not drunk right now so clearly there's no problem.\" Or when I say I'm depressed and considering suicide, no one says \"well you don't cry 24/7 so you're fine.\" Why are the physical indicators so necessary for eating disorders to matter?\n\nGuys, I'm honestly so upset. Every person I tell about my eating disorder either gives the stupidest advice (try a protein shake, etc) or tries to force feed me or  compares their experience to that time they lost their appetite due to the flu or says I'm being stupid by starving myself. These are good friends of mine who are super understanding and kind and empathetic when it comes to my other mental illnesses. \n\nWhat is it about eating disorders that make them so much harder to understand or empathize? It upsets me because I feel like my friends aren't even trying. And if they are, I don't feel like eating disorders are so complex that you can't see that continuously making body comments (either positive or negative) or other rude/offensive reactions might be detrimental to me. It makes me want to isolate and never talk about it again and just starve myself to death alone in my house.",

We seldom idealized eating disorders and we complained and advocated against shows that portrayed EDs as elegant or classy, or like their recovery period was easy and short instead of grueling and long. \n\nRegardless, our subreddit was removed by the Reddit team - not even quarantined, but /removed/. They took our safe space down. Lately, I\u2019ve subscribed to a certain fasting subreddit and I am appalled at the harmful behaviors the people there encourage. They encourage underweight people to fast for days on end and applaud them for their \u201cstrong will\u201d. They post about how they still fast even if they feel fatigued or sick, and other people congratulate them for their will power. Underweight status is encouraged. \n\nMost of us who have been on tumblr pro-Ana sites know that that subreddit is identical to these tumblr sites. However, the Reddit team does nothing about it, and that is so unfair and vile. Why are we not doing anything about it? We should raise hell about it and complain to the Reddit team about it.

No matter what I eat now, I never feel satisfied. I have binge ate pretty much every day since last year, waking up each morning telling myself ill fast today, and then crumpling by 8pm and eating who-knows how many calories. \n\nI think my fucked up hunger has caused me to binge on stuff that used to fill me up, which also happens to be super calorie dense. For example, some of the foods I binge on regularly are oats with a bunch of PB and sugar mixed in, mcdonalds burgers and thickshakes, cakes and icecream. Like for fucks sake, I literally drink milk by the cup. No wonder I've fucking ballooned to 135kg (bmi 38) in fucking 16ish months\n\nthis has been a huge physical and mental toll on me. the biggest clothes I could find in my area are tight. My 3xl work shirt, the biggest they make, is bulging. I sit inside all day because I dont want to be seen outside, i dont talk to anyone anymore, and I die inside when I imagine what my family say about me. \n\nidk where this is going. I'm sitting typing this after bingeing on a fucking burger meal with a thickshake and two mars bars, which I hardly even tasted. my stupid head just told me I needed to eat them and *snap* theyre gone. i've set my fasting timer, and i'm here telling myself im going to fast this binge off, for the umpteenth time in a row. all i can ever think of is food and suicide. *why am i like this*\n\nsorry for the rant :/\n\nEdit: thankyou everybody for the kind comments.

I've been dodging the question \"Why don't you eat?\" All year. Coming back after a long weekend without medication left me with questionable judgement.\n\nAgain, I get the question from coworker. I consider myself lucky, she's trustworthy. She's seen some shit. So I told her, \"I just eat at home. So much. I'm doing much better than I used to.\" It didn't click for her. I blurted out: \"I have an eating disorder. Food is hard\"\n\nFireworks behind her eyes, you guys. She lit up and was immediately supportive. Not in a prying way. Not in a pet project way. But genuinely concerned and informed way. Bless it, she even promised to stop asking.\n\n...it felt good to say it out loud",

But the one that is constant, that I can never let go of even when my desire to recover is the strongest, is \"you will gain weight eventually, so you need to get as low as you can now so that you can gain some and still be okay.\"\n\nLike I would love to just like... gain 20lb. Except I want to weigh 80lb and gain to 100. I want to gain weight and look better and get compliments and everyone is happy for me instead of gaining weight and looking worse and gross and everyone whispers about me behind my back about how I let myself go. I want to be able to go even up to a year of not counting a calorie or setting foot on a scale and then when I do start paying attention again I'm still at a perfectly good, socially acceptable weight. \n\nI need to get skinny so that I can be fat, you know?",

It\u2019s like a switch hits in the afternoon but in the morning hardly ever and if I am it\u2019s usually pretty easy to ignore it because I can either chill at home and watch Netflix if I have lectures later in the day or if I do have school it\u2019s an even better distraction.

I don't have a pretty face. On the recovery sub they said that uncontrollable binging after recovery is a myth created \"by scared anorexics\" but in my case, it's totally reality. I bounced from UW to obese in a year. It triggered a relapse.

        "Text": "I know it\u2019s a tough time of year for a lot of us who celebrate Christmas so I just wanted to share whats helped me over previous and current Christmas times \n\nI hope that all of you are able to participate and fully enjoy yourself on the day, but for some I know it\u2019s just not the case right now and there\u2019s a lot of anxiety and increased behaviours - bingeing, purging, restricting, over exercising, lax abuse and so on. We want to avoid this on the day *and the days after Christmas*. (For me it\u2019s always worse the days after because I feel so shit about what happens on Christmas days.)\n\n\nSo, here we go;\n\n\n**Bring your own food.**\n\nMost likely at least few people will be contributing dishes on the day - make and bring something along you absolutely know is safe and you can eat if everything else is too scary. \n\nOur safe foods are all different but a few ideas would be:\n\n- Platters. Fruit, cut up veggies, crackers, cheese, hummus, dips, anti pesto, meats, whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. Easy to chip away at and sustain your energy throughout the day without feeling like it\u2019s too overwhelming. \n\n- Salads. You can have a big plate full of salad and no one will bat an eye. Lots of veggies, but you can also add things like strawberries, boiled eggs, beetroot, dressings, nuts, cheese, croutons, meats/faux meats, tomatoes, pomegranate, onions, etc (probably not all together but some interesting combos are really good)\n\n- Veggie bakes. I\u2019ve made huge veggie lasagnas that were incredibly delicious and seemed super normal. You can use things like low fat cheese or vegan cheese alternatives or even cashews/potatoes blended up with nooch to make a cheesy sauce to bake a bunch of veggies in. Add in tomato sauce and pasta/pasta sheets (I use GF ones) (or layers of starchy veg like potato and pumpkin) and you\u2019ve got yourself a pasta bake/lasagna without oil, cheese, gluten or meat. Of course it\u2019s not the same as the real thing but with a lot of strategic herbs and garlic, almost as good!\n\n- Desserts! I\u2019ve made so many nice and \u2018safe\u2019 raw vegan brownies/cakes/etc, but also things like meringues (egg whites + sugar/sugar alternatives), healthy cookies and cakes, parfaits, apple crumble and sugar free soy-custard, the possibilities are endless!! Just make sure you try it before offering it to your family, because some recipes really don\u2019t work. \n\n**Wear something nice but also comfy**\n\nEveryone eats more than they usually would on days like this. One day will not significantly affect your body or weight. One day of overeating and not compensating will **NOT** make you gain pounds and pounds of fat. \n\nSo wear something forgiving. Wear something you feel confident in and also has room to move in. Skinny jeans, bodycon *anything*, tight waistbands - all no nos. \n\nI\u2019m in the Southern Hemisphere so it\u2019ll be warm on Christmas Day. I\u2019m wearing a beautiful flowy dress that covers my legs and belly and makes me feel great. \n\nPrevious years I\u2019ve worn: T-Shirt dresses, Maxi dresses, rompers/play suits, knitted stretchy high waisted pants and a boob tube, flowy high waisted pants and a matching crop top, stretchy high waisted skirt and a light knit baggy sweater.\n\nIf it\u2019s winter where you are: Perfect! Rug up and get cosy in clothes you love. Or wear a big ugly sweater and look cute as hell doing it.\n\n\n**When people offer you food you don\u2019t want**\n\nSmile and politely say \u201cNo Thank You.\u201d And return to conversation. You don\u2019t need to justify *why*, just leave it at no.\n\n**If you receive food presents**\n\nDon\u2019t freak out, you don\u2019t need to eat it in front of them to show your gratitude. If you think it will trigger a binge and/or purge, you can later re-gift it to someone else over the next couple of days, or give it to another family member the next day. But I strongly recommend allowing yourself to enjoy it in moderation. One year I got a box of 30 beautiful artisan dark chocolates. I had one every second or third day until March the next year. It was lovely to have a gift for that long and to always have something to look forward to in a day or two. I liked it so much that dark chocolate is something I\u2019ll still treat myself to every other week and I\u2019m able to do so with moderation and genuine pleasure. \n\n\n**If people comment on your weight/looks/what you\u2019re eating or if someone gives you the \u201cyou look so *healthy/good* and your brain twists it negatively**\n\n1st option: if it\u2019s malicious/negative - ignore that person and move to someone you like. Don\u2019t give them power over you.\n\n1st option part 2: shut them down with full force (there\u2019s always at least *some* drama on family get-togethers)\n\n2nd option: for well-meaning comments - this one is up to you. Remind yourself that most people do not *get* eating disorders and meant whatever they said from a place of love, encouragement and caring. They love you and honestly just want to see you live your life fully. They don\u2019t want you to suffer. \n\nLooking healthy is a compliment. You\u2019re glowing, you\u2019re radiant, you\u2019re bright and alert, you\u2019re warm and affectionate, you look *beautiful*. You look beautiful for more than what a camera can capture. Our eyes see so much more than the physical.\n\n\n**General Hecticness**\n\nA lot of us thrive in routine, habit, structure. This disturbed can be extremely scary and stressful. \n\n- You can give yourself structure to the day by writing out what\u2019s going to happen, roughly. Things like:\n\n{wake up 8am, shower, wear x and x, finish wrapping presents, 10am drive to Mums. 11am-4pm Lunch at Mum\u2019s. 4pm-5pm Drive to Dads. 5pm-9pm Dinner with Dad and family. 9pm Drive home. 10pm cuddle with [pet/partner] and organise my gifts.}\n\n- Give yourself time outs whenever you need them. Go to the bathroom or sit outside for a few minutes and re-group. I carry essential oils to smell whenever I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed, find what works for you. \n\n- Hang around your favourite person. Could be your same-age cousin or your quite old grandpa. Could be your dad or mum or bf/gf or your aunts cat. Your little niece. Whoever you need it to be. \n\n\nI know some of these won\u2019t apply/won\u2019t help some people because we all do different things and have different familiars but I hope it helps someone, or just prompts someone to have a think about how to prepare themselves for the day and hopefully a bit of harm reduction too.\n\nFeel free to add anything!\n\nE: Formatting\n\nE2: I love you guys.",

I judge other people purchasing high calorie food at the grocery, my friends when we go out to eat, my roommates for snacking or ordering in. I bodycheck the shit out of other girls and it just started as comparison like wanting to see whos legs are skinnier than mine and now i just OBSESS over who is and isnt skinnier than me. No models on websites look model thin to me anymore and I cant tell if theyre hiring bigger girls or if I'm just caught up in my own crazy. I was happy that my sister gained weight because she was always my competition? I know a lot of these feelings are tied into my irrational thinking and i know i can get it to go away if i just fucking.........recover.....",

        "Text": "It's taken 3 months, but they are finally discharging me from inpatient hospitalization. In those 3 months I went from being 76.1 lbs (11.6 BMI) to finally weighing in at a normal BMI today - 123.9 lbs (18.8 BMI).\n\nSo I gained almost 50 pounds and it hasn't been easy dealing with the weight gain, but there are so many things that I've slowly gotten back over the course of my recovery here.\n\nWhen I first came to the hospital I was almost on my deathbed and immobile - could barely lift up my head to take a sip of water. I had to be pushed around in a wheelchair for about a month and was on TPN (basically getting almost all my nutrition from a tube in my arm) for about the same amount of time. My heart rate was consistently in the 40s and my blood sugar and blood pressure were dangerously low. My mom and sister had to stay by my bedside 24/7 and care for me, cause I couldn't do things like go to the bathroom or take a shower on my own. I not only looked like death, but I also felt like death, and everything hurt.\n\nA lot of it was really hard. A lot of crying, screaming, fighting over a few bites of food but the staff here were super patient and kind throughout it all. Since I'm not in a facility that is specifically for treating eating disorders I had a lot of trouble at times but moving to the intensive ward helped a lot.\n\nToday, I am by no means cured and I still have a lot of hard days. But on those hard days I try to remember how far I've come and how many important & wonderful things I've reclaimed in my life.\n\nI can walk. I no longer eat out of a tube. I ate Dunkin Donuts this week!!! My butt doesn't hurt anymore, and the butt cave is gone (see my post history lol). I'm not constantly freezing. I can eat good food again (sometimes), and I went to my favorite Mexican restaurant recently! My relationship with my family has improved DRASTICALLY, and they have become a vital support system to me. I am no longer afraid of hospitals and am comfortable asking for help when I need it. And I am still not 100% healthy but I am healthier and have the energy to do things like walk my dog, go on short hikes, and go birdwatching!!\n\nSo I guess more than anything this post is kind of just me trying to comfort myself, haha. But yknow what, I heckin deserve some comfort after all the shit I've been through. And so does everyone here. \n\nI'm scared of what comes next, and how to deal with life outside of the tiny, safe, sterile bubble that is a psych ward (I am so institutionalized oof), but I have to keep telling myself, I have so much to look forward to. \n\nRecovery is DEFINITELY worth it!\n\nEDIT: I want to say thank you to all the lovely and kind comments on this post. Reading them has really made not only my day, but my whole week and will definitely help to fuel me to continue my recovery journey!!!",

Ofc, there are people giving tips, but in the end of the day, everyone wishes the others could just recover. And when somebody choses recovery, it's treated like a win and he/she is supported. There are almost never fights and nobody talks shit when someone isn't restricting as much. Also, we know that eating disorders can affect anyone, no matter their body type, skin colour etc. \nAnd even though I wish nobody had to struggle with this shit, I'm proud of this community and it's one of the only things I love about having an eating disorder.\n\nIf you read it all, thanks for coming to my TED talk.\nAdd something else if you like to",

        "Text": "The reason you get so excited about a binge and feel compelled to is because of your dopamine receptors.  Thinking about/planning a binge is when your dopamine is firing.  Contrary to popular belief, dopamine is not at its peak when you\u2019re engaging in the pleasurable activity.  It\u2019s at its peak in the planning/anticipation phase, which when you think about it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.\n\nThe reason you keep binging past the point of pleasure is\n\n1) Your dopamine fueled planning told you it would be the most amazing thing ever and you continue to seek for that amazing feeling.\n\n2) Since your dopamine was at its peak during the anticipation phase, that means once you start binging (once you receive the reward your body craved), dopamines job is done and begins to diminish.  You are still seeking that rush and are trying to find it in the food, but it will never be there.\n\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019re left wanting and keep eating past the point of full.\n\nOnce you acknowledge that the peak of exciting and feel good chemicals is likely at checkout in the grocery store or driving up to your home, it makes the binge event a lot less exciting.\n\nYour pleasure comes from planning the binge, not the binge itself.  The act of binging is just the result of your primitive brain responding to the dopamine fueled decision.\n\n\n",

I gained about 20 pounds in that 6 months and recently had a life event that caused me to relapse. it started as \"oh I just need to lose about 5-10 pounds over the next 3 months and I'll be good\" HHHHNOPEEEI warned my husband(married 10 years now) that the storm was coming. after about 2 weeks of low restricting (<500) he realized this was really happening. instead of getting mad, or forcing me to eat, or trying to make me change. he went out and refilled all my vitamins and supplements that I usually take to keep me from dying when I do this. He also took me shopping and told me to buy all my safe foods, and lots and lots of vegetables. his only requests are that I take my vitamins every day, eat a lot of veggies and healthy foods, and that I aim for 800-1000kcal a day. He knows that this will probably last about 6 months or so since that seems to be my cycle and I love that instead of making me feel bad, he's making me feel safe. he asks me WHAT I ate every day instead of HOW MANY CALORIES, and if he thinks I need to eat a bit more he makes me a veggie plate to munch on.the one thing I noticed that he did do, was to take away all my laxatives and my enema kit, I have been known to severally abuse lax and enema in the past and he doesn't want me doing that. I love him so much.\n\nanyways thanks for coming to my storytime"

        "Text": "TLDR at the bottom. \n\nLet me preface this by saying that not only do I have a restrictive ED, but I have several unrelated health issues which require me to avoid certain foods, and requires that I include a certain amount of other foods. Because of this, paired with my ED, I have a very limited diet with not too many food options. The foods I buy myself really are my only options. I almost always can\u2019t just \u201ceat something else\u201d if someone takes the food I\u2019ve bought for myself, I have to go get myself more food, or starve. My food is also often quite expensive since if I want anything tasty I have to get specialty items. \n\nMy whole family knows this and is generally respectful, with one exception: my sister in law.\nShe was fine about it until she had kids, became emotionally unstable, and started getting constantly catered to by everyone. Now she thinks she\u2019s queen shit of fuck mountain, and does whatever she pleases with no regard for anyone else. This includes eating weeks worth of my safe foods when she comes over. Fortunately, she only goes for my dry goods (all the my stuff that needs to be refrigerated is stuff she\u2019s not interested in because it\u2019s \u201ctoo healthy\u201d). \n\nShe will DEMOLISH any little indulgence that I might be parceling out over a month for myself though (snack packs, 100cal baggies of weighed Lily\u2019s almond chocolate, specialty baked goods etc), and it pisses me off, ruins my budgeting, and fucks up my meal plans. So, I started hiding my little treats in my bedroom. That worked for about a week, but then last weekend when she was over with her kids she sniffed out my stash like a grizzly bear, and ate thousands of calories and $50 worth of food while I was out walking my dog. I was livid and confronted her, she cried to my brother and parents that I was shaming her and that I was selfish. She also claimed it was the first time she\u2019d ever done it (bullshit), it was a misunderstanding (TOTAL crap) and she wouldn\u2019t do it again \u201cif she could help it\u201d(you\u2019re an adult woman!). My parents told me they\u2019d pay to replace anything she ate 3 fold if I\u2019d just drop it and save them the headache. \n\nI took that deal, bought myself replacements for my stolen food, a food safe, and a few **extra special** treats *just for SIL to find*.  I bought a bunch of fiber one bars, which I usually don\u2019t get, and laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items. I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap), and labeled the foods on top \u201cPlease do not eat, these are my safe foods!\u201d. Today she brought her brood over, and I took the dog for a walk as usual. Lo and behold, everything that wasn\u2019t in the safe was totally devoured when I got back. She confronted me about the safe, and said I was overreacting (amazing, given the fact that she\u2019d just raided literally all the food I hadn\u2019t locked up), but I just responded pleasantly that I was trying to ensure there\u2019d be no more \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d. About an hour after she confronted me she started to look a little green and kept running off to the bathroom. She looked miserable, and ultimately had to call my brother to come pick her and the kids up because she didn\u2019t think she could drive. \n\nMy brother just called me a few minutes ago, because apparently she shit herself in the car on the way home, has shit herself 4 more times since, and is having a mental breakdown. She\u2019s been blaming me and claiming I poisoned \u201cher food\u201d. I feigned confusion. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t touch her food-...Oh! Oh my god! I didn\u2019t even notice that SIL had eaten ALL of my food again today but I just checked and she ate everything that didn\u2019t fit in my safe!!! Oh no! Oh my god! When we talked last week she said she wouldn\u2019t do that again, AND I put a note on everything that said not to eat it so I thought it would be ok! No wonder she\u2019s sick though! She ate 4 full boxes worth of fiber one squares, and a whole laxative bar! You should take her to the doctor!\u201d  . There was a long pause, my brother didn\u2019t know what to say. Finally he asked why I had laxatives and tons of fiber one, I told him I\u2019d been constipated and since it was in my room,  labeled not to eat it, and had been discussed previously I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem. He let out a long sigh and asked me what kind of laxatives and what the dosage was in case a doctor asked. I told him, and we got off the phone amicably, he even texted me an apology about her eating my food again, and offered to Venmo me money for it. He seems to either believe I didn\u2019t do it intentionally, or feel as if he can\u2019t be mad about it if I did because his wife is a gluttonous lying thief. They\u2019re currently en route to urgent care, and I\u2019m quite pleased with myself. \n\nNever mess with a sick girls safe food. \n\n\nTLDR: SIL continuously steals my safe foods despite being confronted multiple time and being asked to stop, and understanding that it\u2019s a really big issue for me and my overall health when she does. I put fiber one bars and laxatives in place of my safe foods. She ate them all in the span of 2 hours, and got very sick. \n\n\n**Update**: \n\nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n\n\n\n\n"

        "Text": "so i'm pretty sure i'm losing my mind but i've been able to laugh at myself recently and i wanted to share a list of weird shit i've done in my college's dining hall. for context: my college has a meal plan based on 'swipes' of your ID card. each semester you get a set number of 'swipes' that you can use to get meals at different restaurants on campus. one 'swipe' at the dining hall gets you basically unlimited access to a buffet-style restaurant. they have a bakery, a grill, a salad bar, a sandwich station, pizza, and some other shit depending on the day. everything has a calorie label which is pretty cool but probably not super accurate, whether or not i decide to trust the info depends on my mood really. the food is from aramark, so it's pretty mediocre, but whatever. it's a pretty good deal for just one swipe. but of course, i am a degenerate, and i'm pretty sure every employee knows me by now.  \n\nduring my restrictive phases, i:  \n\n- frequently swiped in JUST for coffee. the coffee wasn't good but i could drink literally as much as i wanted, so i'd go in and drink like 6 cups and nothing else   \n\n- brought my food scale in to weigh vegetables from the salad bar. i'd bring it in my backpack, make a salad, then take it to some secluded area in the dining hall and weigh each individual ingredient and log it into MFP  \n\n- often, these 'salads' were literally just pickles, iceberg lettuce, and mustard. they looked absolutely vile and tasted pretty much exactly like you would expect a pickle/lettuce/mustard salad to \n\n- brought measuring spoons/cups to measure stuff like condiments \n\n- you're not technically allowed to take stuff from the dining hall but i would smuggle in containers to take vegetables from the salad bar to steam in the microwave in my dorm. this isn't really all that weird in theory but i would literally grab a plate, load it up with ALL OF THE BROCCOLI/CAULIFLOWER THEY HAD and then waltz on over to some secluded area to stash my haul in the containers i brought. i had to walk past SO MANY PEOPLE with a giant plate of just ??? raw broccoli ??? i did this with lots of different vegetables depending on what they had that day but i'm a hoe for cruciferous veg so that's mostly what i got \n\n- taken like 8 apples at a time to do apple monos \n\n- they have a section for cereal/milk and they offer unsweetened almond milk so i've definitely used a swipe just to fill up a few bottles to take back with me \n\nthese are all pretty insane but that's not even the worst part. i am an absolute GOBLIN in my binge phases, and unlimited food plus AN b/p does NOT mix. for more context, i am visibly underweight so i get looks already (my bmi ranges from 14-15 depending on what phase i'm in) and i will remind you again that this dining hall is VERY PUBLIC. when i'm in binge mode i have z e r o shame apparently. \n\n- a standard binge usually involves me making a beeline for the bakery to see what they have. i'm a monster who can't get enough sugar and their cookies are bomb as fuck, so i'll usually load up with like 6 and then get some brownies or cupcakes or whatever they have that day. after i get my haul, i get a big ass bowl of cereal and dip all of my cakes/cookies/etc. into it to soak them in milk and eat them like that. then i eat the cereal. it's fuckin' weird enough for someone to literally only eat desserts but i have to do it that way for e f f i c i e n c y   \n\n- at the sandwich station they have peanut butter, jelly, butter/cream cheese for bagels, etc. but one time they had nutella so of course i got a bunch of chocolate chip cookies, spread nutella on them and made nutella chocolate chip cookies sandwiches then i dipped them in a glass of chocolate soy milk and ate them. it was like two hours before they closed so i was pretty alone but there was a middle aged man watching me the whole time and he looked like a mix of disgusted and terrified but i'm an absolute demon and pressed on anyway  \n\n- taken the cereal bowls to the soft serve machine instead of using the cones or small bowls and filled that bitch up. i also dip brownies and cookies into the ice cream, or crumble them up into it \n\n- i have eaten MULTIPLE peanut butter and chocolate sauce sandwiches just cause i had the ability to make them. no one girl should have all that power \n\n- i accidentally went to the dining hall when my roommate was there, unbeknownst to me, and made direct eye contact with her while carrying two plates, one with 3 slices of pizza drenched in ranch with a giant pile of fries, the other with probably 4 cookies, 2 cupcakes, and a bigass waffle. she didn't acknowledge me, i didn't acknowledge her, we didn't talk about it later   \n\n+plus probably a whole lot more that i can't remember. i don't know exactly why i felt the need to confess my sins here but i guess i just want anyone who reads this long ass post to know that hey, if you're ever feeling embarrassed by the way your ED makes you act, you're probably not nearly as embarrassing as i am! my eating disorder has turned me into an absolutely insane vomit gremlin with zero sense of shame. EDs aren't cute, they're weird and gross and scary and sad but sometimes life really do be like that. \n\n"

The soaps look like cheese, no you can't eat them if you want to keep having a good day, etc, etc. It's been a year since I started and have since lost all of that armpit-scratching animal instinct to eat any of the products because to me it's all stuff you smear on your body and rinse off. It's clay and soap with some oats in between. Don't get me wrong, I love our shit, but it doesn't make me hungry anymore.\n\nAnd then we got the Rudolph jelly face mask in for Christmas.\n\n[https://www.lushusa.com/dw/image/v2/AAHL\\_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-lushcosmetics-export/default/dw51456c65/images/product/08422\\_b.jpg?sw=300](https://www.lushusa.com/dw/image/v2/AAHL_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-lushcosmetics-export/default/dw51456c65/images/product/08422_b.jpg?sw=300)\n\nFuck this little motherfucker. This piece of shit. This shitlicker is made of cocoa powder and orange juice. It's a jelly face mask, which means it's literally the texture of chocolate pudding. It smells fucking indistinguishable from chocolate pudding. It's the color and approximate size of packaged chocolate pudding. I've tasted a number of our products before (for research) (duh) so I know perfectly well how bad they actually taste when you eat them, but oh my god. I get the urge to lick my fingers when I show a customer how it's used. Sure it's made of mud and seaweed too, but nobody's perfect. \n\nThis product looks and smells so fucking delectable it's overridden my year-old toughened retail exterior, calloused from telling thirteen teenage boys a day that they'll be blocked up all weekend if they eat the fresh face masks. But go ahead. Eat them. No really, I'll watch. What're you afraid of, Bryce?\n\nNow I'm Bryce. I haven't tried to eat any yet partially because I \"know better\" and partially because of how much pride I'd lose for giving in to the siren song of such a basic product. But the season isn't over yet. There's time.\n\nBonus: Yog Nog Yule Log. Not sure what it's supposed to smell like exactly, but if it were a real baked good it'd be in my intestines yesterday.\n\nBonus bonus: Day 1182, they still haven't released a nutritional label for the sugar lip scrubs but came out with two new flavors. You're hurting the people, LUSH. You're hurting me."

        "Text": "[https://i.imgur.com/splgDf0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/splgDf0.jpg)\n\nSo, on the left, I was roughly a BMI of 14.5ish, hadn't eaten proper food (250 kcal or less a day) for about two weeks, and on the left was me approx 3/4 weeks into my recovery, in London, at the EL&N Cafe. I'd never have gotten to go there, have the energy to walk around, eat with my boyfriend, and generally enjoy myself if I hadn't taken the leap.\n\nDon't get me wrong - Recovery sucks. I've only just stopped eating like 4k a day and am generally starting to be able to not only think about food. I look in the  mirror and I see a bloated body, but I also see small muscles forming again. My ECGs are normal now, my failing kidneys, bladder, heart & liver are all improving. My seizures stopped. 40 lbs in a month of water, fat and muscle is a LOT of weight gain, but I was also dehydrated, bordering on catatonic & generally, frankly, dying. My weight is now naturally falling again and my loose skin is improving - so it wasn't true weight.\n\nI was starting to slip back into relapse, but I looked at the photo on the left again, yesterday. Back then, all I saw was fat. A disgustingly fat face, but now I see how gaunt and sickly I actually looked. I don't want to be dying, being threatened with a tube, feeling like life is nothing but lethargy. I couldn't even play video games, or work on any art (two favorite hobbies), as I had so little energy. My days were spent in bed. Finally started drawing again, and playing again. \n\nIdk what the point of this post is, maybe to try and inspire someone else to take that leap, too. I wouldn't have done it without watching people like Elanzi, Hatwillbeatthis, Rebecca Leung, etc. They inspired me to just go for it, so I'm kinda hoping I can do the same. 5 weeks ago, I accepted the thought that my anorexia would kill me. Now, I'm actually looking forward to my future again."

It's not something that you can just give up and stay away from like drugs or alcohol. You fucking need food to survive. \n\nI try to have some control but in the blink of an eye I'm suddenly bingeing and I'm at 2,000 calories and I'm getting fucking fatter. I hate being this size. I hate being a slave to food. I hate bingeing and wasting money on food. I hate being ugly because I'm fat. It's so fucking exhausting, I'd rather fucking die.\n\nI'm tired. I love food. But I hate it so much.\n\nAnd no one fucking understands irl. Their advice is stupid because they don't get it.

        "Text": "This post is for you, regardless of your bmi, current ED, your walk of life... purging WILL fuck you over.\n\nA purge is a bandaid solution. You know that. You might be interested in doing it to:\n\n- start fresh\n\n- after a bad binge \n\n- maybe you were forced to eat out with friends/family and you ate what you didn\u2019t want to\n\n- you want to be the Cool Girl/Guy who looks like they eat whatever and \u201cstay\u201d/\u201cget\u201d skinny\n\n- maybe you do it for self harm purposes \n\nAs someone moving from BED to Bulimia, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve concluded.\n\n**APPEARANCE**\n\nI\u2019m not saying y\u2019all are like me, but I can be vain as fuck and put my appearance first. Here\u2019s what you get with purging. \n\n- Weight change. I know this is obviously the big thing. Obviously the scale goes down compared to before a purge. But you\u2019re losing a lot of water, stomach acid etc. which gives you this false sense that you\u2019re losing weight. In reality, most bulimics will maintain or (more likely) gain weight longterm even though you\u2019re \u201c\u201d\u201d\u201dcorrecting\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d your purge. Most bulimics are in the normal-overweight BMI and not formally diagnosed.\n\n- Teeth are fucked, thin, sensitive,  yellow and breath smells bad 24/7\n\n- The skin around your mouth will be ravaged. It\u2019ll be raw and you\u2019ll break out in pimples and weird texture from the stomach acid, snot, tears, vom, bile that comes up\n\n- Swollen glands make your cheeks v chipmunky... my face looks like an amorphous pancake compared to my body and BMI. Nothing will help accelerate your face getting back to normal. Not diuretics, changing water intake, electrolytes. It goes a little with each day you don\u2019t purge.\n\n- Bloodshot eyes, petechiae, burst capillaries around your facs. Nothing really helps it go away faster it just takes days.\n\n- Your hands will get scarred and tears and bleeding. \n\n- Heartburn and stomach pains 24/7. Gut flora is fucked to high heavens. Burps and farts (so much GAS goddamn) and lots of bloating. Surprise involuntary regurg is a bitch.\n\n- Nothing cuter than purging out of your nose or pissing your pants because of the strain of purging \ud83d\ude43. Splashback is also a very real thing... and so is the toilet blocking up biG time\n\n- Your throat is raw and painful, increased episodes of tonsilitis. \n\n**FEELINGS and FUNCTIONING**\n\n- I hear people purge because the purge itself gives them a high. Let me warn you, you may lose the purge high. I don\u2019t feel calm or good or pure like I used to after purging, everytime I near the end of a dissociative binge I absolutely hate and fear the purging after.\n\n- Some, like me, purge to gain back the loss of control that occurs with a binge or the guilt after eating anything at all. There is NOTHING that makes you feel as helpless and out of control than getting stuck in a b/p cycle. \n\n- After you purge food, your body is prepped and rearing to break down food, so with the food gone, your hunger level comes back to before or worse. I always thought I would have \u201cbetter control\u201d than to get stuck in a b/p cycle, but I swear it\u2019s a slippery slope that inevitably happens.\n\n- my gag reflex has been desensitised so my methods of purging become more and more aggressive. I\u2019m sure if i had a dental check up, I\u2019d have bruises down my throat\n\n- You\u2019ll lose electrolytes purging which means more fainting, lightheadedness, poorer concentration in work/study\n\n- Purging comes with increased risks of losing consciousness (and if you pass out at the toilet bowl, you could at least chip a tooth, at worse cause life-threatening damage) and choking whilst purging which is damn terrifying. \n\n**SOCIAL LIFE and FINANCES**\n\nDon\u2019t be blindsided by thinking purging will let you have a better social life- afterall most social activities involve food, right?\n\n- The fear of choking during the following purge will get you choosing foods you don\u2019t even like, so that it comes back up easier.\n\n- you will be the odd one who always runs to the bathroom afterwards or has to leave asap to purge. If you can\u2019t purge in time, the anxiety floods in and you (read: me) may get a bit mental\n\n- you will at some point have your purging session interrupted by someone. Whether it\u2019s by a stranger in a restaurant bathroom, a friend, a family member... that shit is mortifying and isolating.\n\n- You will get more and more desperate with where you purge. Maybe it starts out in the \u201csafety\u201d of your home... one thing leads to another and you\u2019re ready to purge at the vilest, Jackson-Pollock-y gas station toilet. Gross and unhygienic but you can\u2019t help yourself.\n\n- B/P cycles (read later in this post) are fucking EXPENSIVE. You are buying food that will not stay long enough to give you macronutrients or micronutrients. You are literally flushing money down the toilet. One thing that keeps me up at night, is the disgust I feel knowing I wasted so much food, resources, time, energy and money because of this disorder. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is an elaboration on my response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/afmp84/comment/ee0k53c), thanks u/HoldenCaulfield7 for encouraging me to make this a separate post. \n\nAt the end of the day, I can only share my warnings and experiences with y\u2019all. \n\nThe temporary \u201cgood\u201d is nothing compared to the harms it\u2019s given me, and I still feel shackled to this disorder daily. Please be careful y\u2019all and rethink starting purging \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: I\u2019m reading all your comments btw. I have so much love for all of you sharing your stories no matter what stage you are with purging. Love this community, stay strong. Thanks for the gold and silver too darls \u2728"

But lately the desire has been stronger and stronger, the need to just \"undo\" whatever binge I just ate, especially if I'm guilty or anxious or depressed, the panic making my stomach feel bloated and wrong and the idea of getting it back up out of me is becoming less scary and more of a relief.\n\nBut I don't do it. I won't do it. Because I know myself and I know that if I started, if it clicked for me, then it would be very hard for me to stop, if I could stop at all. It would be too easy for me to think I could \"just undo\" a binge after every minor crisis. And every time I'm lying in bed panicking about my life and I look at the ensuite door thinking about how I could \"undo\" the damage, I think of everyone here begging people not to start.

Then they tell you AN is insanely, skeletally skinny and BN is throwing up your food. Oh, and it's dangerous. \n\nBut. Damn my experience and reading yalls posts, there are so many things that should be mentioned. Like: \n\n* Purging just encourages more binging behaviors\n\n* B/P can financially WRECK you\n\n* BN can include purging behaviors that are not throwing up. \n\n* AN isn't about getting as ~sKinNy~ as possible. Mostly it's driven by fear of gaining weight, resulting in a perpetual deficit \n\n* For some (many?), it's not about hating your body, it's about having discrete goals you know how to obtain when everything else in your life is a shit fire\n\n* Losing your period from an ED IS NOT GOOD! It causes low bone density and fertility issues and can mess you up even after recovery \n\n* THE ISOLATION. Holy shit, I did not realize how bad it could get. So many social events revolve around food. That, or you just hate the way you look so much, you can imagine putting yourself in public.\n\n* BED is a real disorder and deserves treatment just like any other ED. \n\n* Not all EDs (or even most) fall perfectly in the criteria of BN and AN. They're still real and just as valid to get help for. If your relationship with food is stressful, you should always feel validated to ask for help."

Only talked about females having it. \n\nLots of males have eating disorders and I just thought it was wrong to do this.\n\nAlso thought it was funny that I was reading this pamphlet while still a little dehydrated from binging and throwing up the night before, and I\u2019m a male. \n\nBut I guess I don\u2019t exist lmao"

My coworker who is significantly taller than me and chubby (she's probably 5\"11 200 lbs while I'm 5\"3 105 lbs) stood next to me and started talking about how tiny I was and even put me in front of her and laughed at how much smaller I was compared to her. I've never been so jealous of someone's confidence. She's really sweet and just the fact that she doesn't think it's bad that she's big or that I'm small. She was just looking at the differences in us as humans and finding humor in it not disgust or self hate. I really need reminders of this sometimes and I'm happy people like her exist because it makes me remember that not everyone is competing with me constantly some people are happy with what they look like even if they aren't model status and that's okay. And I know one day I will have that confidence too. "

We're all just as malnourished. In fact the ed voice is so much stronger now that I've \"lost progress\" if you feel me. I feel like I'm in the wrong body. Nothing feels right. I can't eat anything without feeling an overwhelming guilt and physical discomfort. My safe food list has decreased dramatically. But hey, atleast I look healthy??

I made you a small bowl and left the cheese off\n\nHer [with forced jollity]: oh no, I\u2019m fine thanks!\n\nHim [flatly, clearly irritated]: I don\u2019t want to deal with this stupidity. I\u2019m going to bed.\n\n*Husband exits stage left*\n\nWoman digs empty tin can out of the garbage, looks furtively over her shoulder as she carefully spoons spaghetti into empty can. Buries can at bottom of bin, places some more rubbish on top.\n\n[later, in bed]\n\nHim: nothing\nHim: nothing\nHim [tightly]: you didn\u2019t eat the spaghetti, did you?\n\nHer: .... oh, of course I did! It was really good!"

        "Text": "Yesterday me and the bf decided to treat ourselves to a proper dinner date. Being an absolute darling, my boyfriend suggested a fancy seafood restaurant, because he knows that seafood is my ultimate safe food. Also, fancy = tiny portions, so I wasn't freaking out about having to eat a meal that I hadn't personally prepared. Of course, I still overtrained and restricted for the whole day leading up to the date, because I wanted to have a glass of white wine and this bitch can't deal with the calories in alcohol.\n\nSo, as a starter, we ordered some fish tartare. I was feeling great about it, because you know, my ortho ass is a slut for lean protein. But! It came served with a side of salad, fresh fruit, brown bread and... Salted butter.\n\nYou guys. Butter is THE fear food for me. I hadn't had it in YEARS. But yesterday I allowed myself to pick the smallest slice of bread, spread a smudge of butter on it (couldn't have been more than 5 grams tbh - small steps), and eat it. And I didn't feel guilty afterwards. I genuinely thought I was never going to eat butter ever again for the rest of my life, yet here I am. \n\nI think that maybe, just maybe, I might be getting the hang of this recovery thing. It's really hard, but right now it looks more attainable. If anyone reading this is thinking about trying to recover - please do it. Just try. It's gonna be OK."

        "Text": "Well I need to share this insight with you.. DAE remember the skinny cool girl strategy someone posted about 1 week ago? I thought a lot about it. The idea of SCG strategy was to think of the future self as motivation, so I asked myself who I wanted to be in the future, and concluded I just want to be a normal eater. So I started to think what a normal eater would do in every situation, and today I avoided a binge.\n\nI was near that sandwich place I love and I wanted to have something... BUT THEN I started to talk to me. I asked myself what a normal eater would do. \"Am I hungry?\" No I wasn't. And I started to think what my sister, my mother, my coworkers, would do in that case. The answer was always \" they wouldn't stop, they wouldn't even think about it\". And I acted like them!\n\nI know.. tHanKs I'm CuReD. BUT it worked for me!\n\nEdit: the basic idea is.. I feel like I \"unlearned\" my normal behaviour and now I need to have a role model to learn it again. I think I lack a sense of normality. I don't want to be pretty or skinny. Just want to be normal. Just like the other girls. What do they feel, how do they act?"

        "Text": "I won't even go into the incel communities but I'm still so mad and hurt that /r/proed got shut down. I am in my 30s, have been on and off of ED communities since Myspace/Livejournal/Nutridiary and legit this is the only one that was supportive and focused on harm reduction. We need a place to be honest with each other. In the throws of my ED if a normal person tells me something is dangerous I just roll my eyes and move on (I've lived with this for twenty+ years) but being able to see things discussed on Reddit really helped. Like 'yes, you shouldn't do XYZ.' This is also why drug subs exist...\n\nThere are a ton of drug reddits (including meth and opiate subs) for people not seeking recovery, how are those less harmful than our subs? \n\nNow there are notices up in diet subs that we're not wanted there either. I'm pretty disappointed in Reddit."

The guy is a total babe and we had such a good time. \n\nAnyways, we had planned to go out for drinks - halfway through he asks me if I want to split an app. I say no, I already ate, and yet he says \"Aw come on, just something to snack on!\" so he ordered chips and guac. Obviously I want to play it cool so I snack on them a bit. \n\nThen, I spent the night at his place and when we woke up he made me BREAKFAST! \\[yes I know he is boyfriend material\\] anyways the point is, I never eat breakfast. I ended up shoving pieces of the toast in my purse when he wasnt looking and ate just the eggs and pineapple. \n\nHe also gave me a slice of gingerbread that I claimed I was too full to eat. \n\nI literally drove home, throwing pieces of bread out of my car window as I was picking it out of my purse.

ANYWAY). today we were at a museum where you can weigh yourself to see which animal you\u2019re close in weight to and he got a penguin; no one else weighed themselves. Later my mom  was roasting him for it and he says to her jokingly \u201cyou should\u2019ve weighed yourself I wonder what animal you\u2019d have got\u201d (lmao go off king) and then he says that I would have gotten a snake because I\u2019m skinny. \n\nhonestly I know I\u2019m not actually fat at a size uk 6/8 but I\u2019m definitely not super skinny, I\u2019m short and have a small frame so I always feel like I carry my weight badly and that I\u2019m still fat despite being small. idk maybe other people don\u2019t see it that way and when my friends call me skinny I\u2019ll disregard it as flattery but the fact that a brutally honest kid said it really made me stop hating my body just for a little bit. It\u2019s been a few hours since he said that and now I\u2019m like \u2018but kids have a skewed perception of reality I really am a chonky bitch\u2019 lol. My self image has been improving recently though, I\u2019ve gotten back to weight training and have started to notice some muscle gains and I\u2019ve also been trying my hardest to recover from bulimia. I\u2019ve gone from purging multiple times a day to only purging 5 times in the past 42 days!! funnily, I think the incessant need to have everyone (including myself) think that I\u2019m skinny has passed, I just really want to be a normal person with normal eating habits again even if that means accepting that I\u2019m a normal weight \n\np.s. my nephew is an angel and I hope he doesn\u2019t develop an ED in the future because my family does shit like allow him to eat 3 ice creams in one day and then say \u201cLOL just have some self control fatty\u201d"

        "Text": "She had an ED, and it contributed to her untimely end at 55. I don't think she ever sought treatment, but it was definitely there. I think drunkorexic, and my mom caught her purging a few months before she died. Her safe foods were Mr. Goodbars and pink wine, and she would have huge dinners on the weekend. \n\nShe just collapsed one day. They found cancer, and she gave in after that. Checked into hospice and very quickly withered away because she had no body fat to sustain on. \n\nThe last time I saw her was in the hospice. It didn't even look like the end because she had always been so thin. She was smiling. I think she was glad to finally have a physical ailment; almost a validation of the internal demons she suffered for so long. I don't remember what she said. \n\nWhen I would stay with her on the weekends, she would just spoil me to death. New computers, video games, a puppy, CDs, SNACKSNACKSNACKS, and so on. Mostly she left me alone, which was fine by me. I liked the quiet. \n\nShe would pass out drunk with her eyes open -- I remember this vividly. I used to sneak and steal her candy and I feel so bad for that now. \n\nI'm so like her in many ways. My food hoarding habits definitely come from her. My inability to portion meals comes from her. I'm not saying this to tarnish her memory. It's important to remember how disordered she was so I can model healthier habits. \n\nRest well, Beverly. I will always love you. My mother's mother. You were imperfect, but you were mine. I carry your memory with me. \u2764\ufe0f"

I don't doubt that this way of thinking is a result of people associating eating disorders with teenage girls, whose feelings are frequently dismissed as silly and shallow anyway. Additionally, I think it's quite obvious you can't take someone's pathological fear of weight gain (itself often a symptom of an ED), use it against them and expect them to recover."

A big thanks to my fellow mods for helping run this circus.\n\nThank you to everyone for making the community here wonderful- whether you were here from the beginning and we were displaced from proED or if you found us later. \n\nNo matter what ED you have, no matter your age or walk of life, your struggles are valid and we're all here right beside you. I'm so proud of how caring and genuine our community is, how we make sure each other's safe in the scheme of things, how we can commiserate our black-and-white thinking and dysmorphia and the shitshow that EDs are. \n\nI know EDA isn't the same as ProED, but you guys still feel like family :)\n\n***Here's to 2019 being the best year yet, my loves! \ud83d\udc93***\n\n&#x200B;"

It was just so heavenly, so full of flavor and delicious. I almost cried when I told my boyfriend that in months I finally felt pleasure while eating. \n\nI was able to share a entree with him, eat my full soup of noodles and eat dessert. And the best of all? I don\u2019t feel guilty. I am  s u p e r  full and my belly looks like a globe but I am just happy that I had a meal that was really enjoyable, and also shared with my favorite person in the world. \n\nThank you for reading \u2764\ufe0f"

You likely need salts back. \n\nThere are electrolyte powders at 0 kcal with flavors like lemon and berry that you can drink in water. They taste kinda weird but they will provide necessary ions back to your body and make your body work better. \n\nThese salts are also in Gatorade and other sports drinks, because athletes can lose salts quickly. If you hate the powders, you can try these drinks or coconut water. \n\nHope you\u2019re all feeling okay today. Hang in there, friends. "

This disease has become its own identity living in my body, a parasite draining my lifeforce to sustain itself. I've been hospitalized for times than I can even remember, both psychiatric and medical admissions, inpatient treatment programs, near-death/close calls/\"ah-ha\" moments. It's cost me meaningful relationships, experiences, opportunities; it hurts to think about how different things could have been without this. Looking back, what stands out isn't what I learned in university, studying philosophy, art, and psychology, or meeting, dating, and marrying my husband (who has stuck by my side for 9 years, despite all the pain I've put him through; he deserves better), the places we've traveled and the people I've met. It's the eating-disordered thoughts and behaviours, the effort I put into maintaining those behaviours, the hospitalizations and how sick I've been and all those times I've nearly died, the food, god, the food... the analysis, the numbers, the compensation.\n\nMy weight has stuck around \\~85lbs for the past 2 months. I'm eating less than 1000kcal/day, with some \"limit\"/goal of 1200.  This isn't normal, or sustainable. My heart rate is low 40s, my bone marrow is depleted, my white cell count is low so my immune system is shit. I just got out of 5 weeks in hospital for my heart fucking up. I have a meal plan, but it's really hard to stop thinking in terms of calories. I want the freedom of zooming out, away from the numbers and just keep things simple.\n\nI don't want to live like this anymore, and recently I've been experimenting with normalcy; this week, I'm normalizing having 2 slices of bread at a meal (either 2 slices of toast at breakfast, or a sandwich for lunch/dinner), eating within an hour after waking up in the morning, and getting the bus instead of walking (free transit this week, no excuse). It's getting better, I think;  I can feel my way of thinking shifting a bit, though I know I need to keep plowing forward and not hesitate or look back.\n\nIt's time to let go. Wish me luck, please, I guess.\n\n&#x200B;"

I obviously don't buy it but go along with it because I've got nothing better to do. Besides! He only takes one client at a time, how could I miss such an opportunity?\n\n*Unfortunately* this girl has to go to school or some shit, and as soon as she stops responding, our mysterious doctor contacts me! And so this dumb fuck tells me that by sticking a ballpoint pen in my ass cheek, I will be able to burn up to 3,000 cals in less than a day! And  I don't even have to break skin! I just poke my butt cheek with the pen and 3,000 cals instantly vaporized!\n\nThis dipshit even had a whole list of prices and how different pens burned different amount of cals, but out of the *kindness* of his heart, this absolute babe was offering to help me for free.\n\nHe asked for some pictures of pens, I complied. He asked me to choose one. I did. He stops responding. The girl from before checks up on me, asks me how I like him or some shit. I tell her everything is great! Can't wait to lose this weight! She reminds me that everything is going to work out great and then I'll have that perfect hot bod. Oh oops! She's stopped responding. But at least my *favorite* doc is back.\n\nHe makes sure to remind me that this is legit. Of *course* it is! How could I doubt him? So this darling tells me that he does have to go on video call to instruct me on how to poke this ballpoint pen into my(left) bare ass cheek in order for me to experience the miracle calorie burning. But it's okay! He says I don't have to show my face! Truly a saint.\n\nThen he video calls me and for some reason I don't get to deny or accept the call, it just accepts for me, I freak out, call him a fucking creep, but this poor man reminds me again that what he's doing isn't bullshit, but if I want to doubt him and stay fat then that's on me and I get blocked.

I've put back on a bit of weight (ayyyy, recoverayy!), and I think I am the most repulsive human to walk this earth. Hawt. Yet this guy was hot, fit, and he seemed to like me. He kept telling me how hot he thought I was! SCORE. And my response to this... was to get drunk and tell him all about how fat I've gotten, how I USED to be sewhawt, why I am a terrible, boring as FUCK person, and how no one sane could POSSIBLY find me attractive. I'm ugly and not that fun hahaha^^^lovemeplz. Hot, amiright? To the surprise of literally no one, there was no second date... \n\n\n\n\nANYWHO, I'll get to the point. When I was obese, no one wanted to date me. When I lost a bit of weight, guys showed me more interest, but no body wanted to date me. So I lost more weight. Lather, rinse, repeat. At my lowest weight, yeah some guys were keen to fuck me. But no one wanted to date me. Say what? \n\n\n\n\nI spent a lot of time, looking around me and seeing women who (in my fucked mind) were much, much larger than me, and they were all in happy relationships. How??? I always thought once I was skinny enough, someone would finally love me. Nearly starved to death waiting to be skinny enough to be loved. \n\n\n\n\nWell, turns out hating yourself is unattractive as fuck, and being a negative hoe doesn't inspire positive attention. Whoda thunk it. \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nIt's really hard to find someone to love you, if you can't even fathom the thought of loving yourself, so guess I'm gonna die alone. "

I'm worse off. I'm more depressed than I've ever been and I know if I weighed less that wouldn't be so bad. "

I get that. But it\u2019s not JUST veganism! There\u2019s keto and IF and all this other shit but they ban veganism??? And not all people decide to be vegan just bc it\u2019s a fad or it will make them lose weight!\n\nAND considering I haven\u2019t had meat and dairy for 15 years like wouldn\u2019t they understand that if I DID have it ALL OF A SUDDEN that it would make me incredibly fucking sick and halt my progress?! \n\nI would, and I *will* literally die before I ever touch a piece of animal flesh again.

So C4D is the only place I found that lets you eat vegan! Will update w how the food is when I\u2019m back \ud83d\ude02"

        "Text": "So I might get some hate for this, I don\u2019t know. But I think it\u2019s something important to think about. Please read the whole thing before passing judgement. \n\nSo I\u2019ve had a bad day. Week. Month. Year. Whatever. So I decided to binge for lunch. I ordered a Mac and cheese and the lady gave me a medium instead of the small with a big smile on her face. I immediately started cursing this woman in my head. How dare she?! But now later on I\u2019m reflecting on it a bit more. She was doing something nice for me, she tried to brighten my day with something that a healthier person would have enjoyed. I called this woman, internally, all sorts of vile names even though she was only trying to be kind. And I knew this Mac and cheese would end up in the toilet anyway. I tried to justify my anger at her by saying that she didn\u2019t know if I had a health concern, but really, even if I did there\u2019s no real harm a medium Mac and cheese can do that a small wouldn\u2019t have. \n\nNow I\u2019m thinking on other times I\u2019ve done this. Friends and family I\u2019ve put down for repeatedly inviting me out to dinner when all they wanted to do was spend time with me. The bartender who gave me an extra lime because he thought I was cute. The girl in the office that left candy on my desk because she saw me crying earlier. \n\nAll of these people were only trying to be sweet to me but my disorder demonized them because of my own unhealthy thoughts and coping mechanisms. I think this is an important distinction to make. We don\u2019t want the world to become as bitter and disillusioned as we have. I know I want everyone to be a little nicer to each other, and if this is how people show it, maybe I\u2019m the one who is wrong. I need to rethink some things and address that these are my issues to work through. I need to be mad at my disorder for making me feel this way instead of innocent people who are only trying to brighten my day. \n\nAll that being said, there is a gray area. That guy who gave you regular coke instead of diet is an asshole. He doesn\u2019t know if your diabetic. The girl that gave you a dirty look for politely refusing a free sample is a bitch, she turned her politeness into rudeness. The server at chipotle who ruined your burrito with a heaping mass of extra guacamole and sour cream is doing a disservice to the burrito eating community because no one wants a soggy wet burrito with 8 mouthfuls of mush. \n\nBut in some situations I think we as disordered individuals need to take a step back from the situation and evaluate why certain things make us feel the way that they do. Is our anger and frustration justified? Or is our disorder just unhappy with the situation? \n\nI know I\u2019m guilty of letting my eating disorder turning me into a cold bitter person at times. And I need to reflect on that a bit more. Just something to think about. "

I didn\u2019t have boobs that draw attention to me. I didn\u2019t hate to be seen eating. My thighs didn\u2019t rub and chafe when I ran. I could wear whatever and it didn\u2019t matter if the outfit was ugly because I was skinny and that\u2019s what matters. I saved money because I wasn\u2019t spending much on food and because I could buy children\u2019s clothes. I could wear a bathing suit in public. I had fucking abs. I didn\u2019t have heartburn from eating fatty foods. I actually enjoyed eating (small amounts of calorie calculated) healthy food. \n\nI still wasn\u2019t confident or even happy with my body, but at least I didn\u2019t cry when I looked in the mirror. And of course there were a ton of downsides, but all I can think about right now are the great things about being underweight that I miss so much.

        "Text": "Hey everyone. I\u2019ve commented in this community but never posted before, but I really just need a distraction right now. I just allowed myself to eat the MOST delicious grilled cheese with two slices of sourdough, butter, 3 slices of cheese & a cup of a cream based tomato soup. I have thought about this meal nonstop for the past three weeks and today I\u2019ve had enough. I told myself I would allow myself to eat it because it\u2019s in my calorie range (I actually went 24 calories over but I\u2019m telling myself that\u2019s okay) and an important step in ~*~ReCoVeRy~*~ is learning balance and giving into cravings from time to time. So I did it.\n\nIt was so fucking good you guys. Every other time in my life when I\u2019ve eaten something that made me go over my calories or isn\u2019t healthy I say fuck it and binge, or over exercise to purge. But I\u2019m not going to do that this time. I\u2019m going to be happy that I gave into my craving & know that now I won\u2019t be thinking about it every second of every day for the next 3 weeks and I\u2019m going to move on. Tomorrow is a new day, I\u2019ll get a great workout & I\u2019ll eat nutritiously. \n\nI hope that someday this won\u2019t be considered a victory, but for now I\u2019m happy with this. I hope that someday this will just be the way that I live my life and I won\u2019t have to tell myself over and over that this is okay and healthy and that I\u2019ll be fine (like I\u2019m doing now). I\u2019m hoping that this moment will lead to another moment that will lead to another moment to eventually a lifetime of non-disordered, normal eating.\n\nThanks for listening to me y\u2019all. I know this is stupid as fuck & nobody outside of our community would get it. I think I honestly just needed a place to write my feelings out. This is therapeutic."

I held it together as people constantly posted their fasting, for days. I lost it when a little girl (she's only 13-14) who hadn't eaten for a week, for hours and hours for 3 days I begged to eat, posted how she had 100 hours left of fasting and someone said \"good.\" I lost it, I can't take it, how could someone be so awful? I wanted to yell at them, she's dying and you're encouraging her? How could you? Going to that chatroom has ruined me I feel like falling back into my old habits and starving myself and vomiting all over again, when I've been working so hard to recover.  \n\n\nEdit: If there is anything to take away from this, it's how toxic that movement is and how unfair it is, anyone who reads this, for your own mental health NEVER EVER join anything to do with proana, not even if you're curious.

For example, if I ran 10 minutes but my calories burn is at 89 then I have to keep going until it's a perfect 100 calories. If by then the time elapsed is 12 minutes 48 seconds then I gotta keep going until it's a rounded perfect 15 minutes. Same thing for distance, it has to be a whole mile or half a mile increment. \n\nMy proudest moment was achieving 300 calories burnt in 40 minutes having run 3.5 miles EXACTLY. It's so satisfying to my fuked up lizard brain. \n\nI've been on the treadmill for up to 2 hours before just trying to get that 'perfect trio' of numbers. I'll treat it like a game, even, messing with the speed and incline to try and match the numbers so that they're pleasing to me.\n\nIt's so obsessive and I don't know anybody else who does this. I do it purely for the satisfaction of 'perfect whole numbers' and even I think it's a tad excessive. \n\nAnyone else have weird exercise rules?"

In my mind, I was already deleting it. However, when I saw it I was astonished. I didn\u2019t recognise myself. My butt looked big in a good way, my waist looked small, my back looked defined and most of all, even though I consciously hid my face it was apparent that I was naked and thoroughly having a great time. My hair looked weird but you always find something, right? \n\nAll in all, it was a great experience and made my night. My boyfriend is amazing, I love how he doesn\u2019t specifically ask permission (knowing myself, id reject most proposals) but makes sure I still have all the control. I am very grateful for him and the video is hot af,\nWill be used for future wanking. I wanted to share some positivity. Usually I feel crappy but this was a great spurt of positivity in dark times.

I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix.

I lead a small group of 8-9 year old girls every Sunday at church. I've had them since they were 6, so there are some pretty strong connections there. I love these girls.\n\nToday, one of them was hugging me around the waist and declared \"you're skinny!\" I didn't know how to respond so I was like \"okay?\" and she replied \"yeah, it's a good thing.\" This same girl has a FitBit and constantly checks her step count, and today she was really proud to wear what she called her \"skinny leggings\". She's a gymnast. I've noticed she spends a lot of time in the bathroom. I'm worried about her.\n\nAnother girl was stubbornly refusing to stand up and so we were trying to pull her. It was just some fun, and soon she gave in and stood up with us, but another girl innocently told her \"you're heavy\". Suddenly everyone was telling each other they're so heavy, so I jumped in with \"hey, we're *all* heavy because we have organs and bones!\" But then they decided to *pick me up* and promptly told me that I'm light.\n\nIdk man. It breaks my heart that these comparisons of heavy vs light and skinny vs fat are already on their minds. I try to be a good influence but I'm hopelessly stuck in this eating disorder and I can't be the role model they deserve."

I hated shopping because I take so long and would often panic and buy stuff I didn't even want. Then something magical happened. I started working at a grocery store.\n\nholy SHIT do we not care what you do. So here's the thing, 99% of the time, the check out people don't suspect anything, Your cart could be full of diet soda, laxatives, sugar free syrup, tea, any of the grim necessities, and the cashier wouldn't notice. The 1% of the time they notice, it's because that person also has an ED. For instance, I notice, but it's not because i'm judging you, it's because I feel some solidarity with you. I've asked my coworkers before if they notice weird carts, and they do not. \n\nAnother thing. People come into the store and spend HOURS there. They eat tons of samples and wander around aimlessly. People without ED's. We don't care, it does not stand out. \n\nLiterally the only thing we remember about a customer at the end of the workday, if anything, is how they treated us. If you're an asshole we're remember you. If you're especially kind and chatty we might remember you too. If you just come and go, even if you're spending a long time or buying a lot of 'suspicious' stuff, we won't remember you.\n\nSo here's my advice. Take a deep breath, take your time, ask any questions you want to (I promise, no one will judge), and go on your merry way. Grocery  shopping fear is valid, but it's easier once you accept that there's no real reason for it."

I've been trying to understand what drives my ED for years, it keeps changing & morphing: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- feeling pride, comfort, or elation when you realize you\u2019ve gone X hours without eating. Feeling a heightened sense of pride when you realize during those X hours, you didn\u2019t even think of food.\u00a0\n\n\\- substituting actual successes with eating disorder successes. When you have a nonproductive day at work, thinking\u00a0\u201cWell at least I ate below 500cal today, so the day isn\u2019t a complete failure\u201d. Slowly the eating disorder successes start to take over in place of actual success and becomes your life. The world gets smaller with an eating disorder.\u00a0\n\n\\- being unable to sustain a romantic relationship because there is no one who will love you as intensely, as passionately, as closely as your disorder. The allure of sex pales in comparison to thinking about the food you\u2019ll allow yourself to eat after the next hour and forty-four minutes pass. \n\n\\- breaking up with someone because they distract you from maintaining your relationship with your disorder. They try to help you because they care about you, but you reject them. Having a decreased sex drive because your body is starving and your BMI is 15.8.\u00a0\n\n\\- feeling superhuman when you watch other people eat. Because if you need less resources, if you\u2019re different than the fools who need food to survive, what are you but superhuman, above it all?\u00a0\n\n\\- clinging to your disorder because it gives you an identity, albeit a pointless one. Feeling like you haven\u2019t accomplished enough, that you aren\u2019t important enough, that you\u2019re not good enough compared to everyone else - and thus you don\u2019t have an identity to call your own. You\u2019re not yet \u201cthe record holder for X sport\u201d or\u00a0\u201cthe Pulitzer prize winning journalist\u201d or\u00a0\u201cthe bestselling author\u201d or \"the scientist with 3 published papers\". So you embrace your disorder because at least you\u2019ll be\u00a0\u201cthe skinny and ... sort of successful X\u201d\u00a0\n\n\\- seeing a super thin girl walk past you in the subway station and being unsure if you\u2019re attracted to girls, or if you just want her body specifically. Trying not to appear as \"creepy\" by continuing to stare at her thigh gap and the bit of collarbone that\u2019s showing under her blouse.\u00a0Looking away when she meets your eyes briefly, and now you know that she knows that you know - that you are both wasting away. \n\n\\- seeing a super thin girl walk past you and becoming competitive with her internally. \n\n\\- when your bones start to lose density and you can feel the aches when you\u2019re trying to go to bed and you contemplate starting melatonin because you have to wake up at 6am for work the next day\n\n\\- infiltrating the world of keto dieters, vegans, marathon runners, ballet dancers, people who fast for health or clearer thinking \u2026 because then you somewhat fit in. Browsing r/fasting or r/1200isplenty or r/intermittentfasting because you\u2019re trying to fool yourself into thinking what you\u2019re doing has a silver lining. \n\n\\- lying to yourself by thinking that once you hit X weight, all your problems will magically be solved.\u00a0\n\n\\- developing avoidant attachment style because the moment you let someone in, they destroy the illusion of control you have over your life that your disorder grants you."

Took me 10 minutes to notice that he had been following me through the store, putting my favorite things that I had picked up and put down, into his basket. \n\nWhen I asked him what he was doing, he said \"what? Might be good to just have around, in case one of us wants it!\" \n\nHe does not eat any of these things. He knows I know that. But he also knows I feel less pressured about it that way. Less pressured and uncomfortable about him buying me the stuff. \n\nIt was just a sweet moment. Now I'm sitting here munching on my favorite yogurt. I love him."

I started bingeing last night and I was feeling that helpless surrendered feeling when I remembered that comment.\n\nI tried something.  I decided to take the cheese out of the refrigerator.  Not a binge-action, but a decision that I verbalized to myself: \u201cI am going to eat a slice of cheese.\u201d\n\nThen I ate the cheese, which was separate from my partially-completed binge somehow because of the thought behind it.  As I was eating the cheese, I stayed in that frame of mind and *decided to stop eating*.\n\nHoly shit it was like a magic trick.  Deciding to eat cheese put me back in control of my body.  \n\nThank you to whoever made that comment.  You saved me such misery last night and through today.  I also feel like I have this new tool.  I\u2019ve never ever felt like anything could stop a binge before this.  I also didn\u2019t feel like I needed to purge.  Magic."

The first time I was fairly certain he was fucking with me - 'cause I'm fat, ya know - and what cute sweet, Titanic-era Leonardo DiCaprio-looking boy would be interested in me with my undercut hair that screams \"Hi, I'm bi!!\" and my androgynous baggy flannel shirts. I'm currently the biggest I've ever been in my adult life and I feel like a total heffer, but hey, this cow got game! \n\nI grabbed my zero calorie Monster, sauntered my legging-clad ass up to the register, he smiled, complimented me for a third time and smiled and I thought \"What the fuck have I got to lose?\". \n\nI took my receipt and asked him for a pen. He smiled bigger and handed me a pencil and without second-guessing myself I wrote down my first name and my number. I left that store feeling like a goddamn boss! I felt so proud of myself because it's so hard for me to put myself out there due to being so self-conscious. He just texted back. It was quick - I assume he was on his break - but he thanked me and said he'd text me later. \n\nI don't want to seem like I'm bragging. I'm writing this because I want all of you beautiful people to know that the way you perceive yourself isn't always how others perceive you. Don't let your body be a prison. Don't wait until your \"skinny enough\" to take positive risks and reach out to people. We all have our crosses to bear and people for the most part will see you for the lovely person you are. And if they don't, find people that do because believe me, they're out there.\n\nLove you guys."

I talk blatantly about not eating so my drinks are more effective and I live in my sorority house so they can all see the way I eat but since I match beauty standards no one gaf I\u2019m just a #relatablequeen for the drunkorexia and #goals for the veganism I use actually to get away with not eating.\n\nif this is coming off as a flex I apologize because that\u2019s not what I\u2019m trying to do because I\u2019m not happy..all this external validation for my shitty behaviors is making this whole \u201c\u201drecovery\u201d\u201d thing really freaking hard. The world is vain and I feel like I was stupid to try and make myself think it wasn\u2019t"

        "Text": "This is going to sound so fucked up but bear with me. This weekend I went on a vacation with a couple of friends from a past internship. Well one of the past girls I worked with is a 5'5\" size 24, 4XL, and over 300lbs. She is a SWEETHEART and a beautiful person and is currently working on her PhD at an Ivy. \n\nShe's a very picky eater. Not like she stuffs her face with ice cream or fries or whatever, but we went to this vegan place, she orders a kale salad and ate two bites and stopped eating it. I got donuts and she would eat only three bites and stop eating. Then all of our group went to a restaurant and the waitress forced us into a tiny booth. Her stomach was over the table. I felt extremely bad and said \"my hips are way too wide for the table, do you guys want to move somewhere else?\". I saw her struggling walking up this hill in the city and told everyone, \"I'm super down for coffee right now!\" because I saw a coffee shop close by with a bunch of seats. She can't stand up for long and we were at this show where we were standing, she said she was going to the bathroom and never came back. I went to check on her and she was sitting at the bar at top and said that the music was too loud, and I had to play along like \"yeah...my ears are ringing too!\" like I was not aware why she needed to sit down. \n\nI felt like I had to be an advocate for her in secret but it triggered me so much because I felt like the fat friend. Like I was the one who needed to do all of that and make excuses for myself. I think at a point she saw I was slightly losing some of my temper and I feel a bit bad but also felt like she needed to know too. But yea I feel super judgy venting this and hate myself lol \n"

It was horrible and no matter what anyone told me, no matter what I knew, my brain ignored all logic. I was going to gain weight from water and there's nothing anyone could tell me to convince me otherwise.\nBut like, I'm drinking water without fear again. I got over it and it feels GREAT. I could cry of joy. And ik it sounds stupid but I thought I'd just share"

I've just spent a lot of time crying for my old self and for all the girls. and all the boys and everybody hurting, im sorry \n\nthanks for listening to my rant no need to comment. it is what it is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nactually.,.... since I'm going to post this,,, isn't dating with an Ed so awkward..... like \"wanna go for dinner?\" lol awkward \"thats all you're gonna have?\" \"hahaha what a waste!\" (if we hang out all day) \"dont you need to eat?! come let's go eat let's go fucking eat\" why is everybody obsessed with eating and hanging around food, I don't want to be around food I don't want to eat in front of you I don't want you to see me eating. I'm a chef everybody this is fucked I'll cook for you I'll watch you eat and I might grab a plate and eat strategically in-front of you if I   Have to but for goodness's sake where's the tact. I don't eat as much as you and I won't ever! leave me alone....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmaybe I shouldn't be dating I'm really not well still"

In the original image a woman is offering her husband a cake, in my image I'm cutting myself a slice. I know food is referenced but in no way was this piece about my ED, I would literally never make art about my ED in this context, I just wanted to make an image about women reclaiming agency. \n\nMy professor is my faculty advisor, I've taken loads of classes with her, and we're very close. She's made references before to how skinny I am but I try to just ignore them. When I proposed this piece I specifically said it was about autonomy and self-sufficiency. Eating disorders never came up. So imagine my surprise when during the crit, in front of the entire class of 16 people or so, my prof goes, \"We can't ignore the way this image invokes eating disorders, you know, it makes you think about starvation.\"\n\nIt literally doesn't??? I just had to stand in front of the class for fifteen minutes talking about eating disorders pretending like they don't affect me. I guess I did a bad job because afterwards my prof came up to me and was like, \"Are you ok? seems like that was a rough crit for you.\" I just teared up and said she didn't have to put me on the spot like that and then left. I have a meeting with her tomorrow regarding something else that I'm now d r e a d i n g. fml. "

        "Text": "This turned into a long story but I need to get off my chest.\n\n\nI'm 26. I work in a fairly big office with lots of different people.\nThere is usually always food brought in for lunch, from snacks to chocolate, cake, pies, etc. For the most part, I was recovered. I could enjoy these things in small doses without panicking. I was a healthy BMI and maintaining my silent recovery. You see, nobody knew as I didn't really feel comfortable talking about it, does anybody really? I feel that's part of the reason. \n\n\nA few months ago, because one of the bigger girls in the office was going on holiday and getting married, she decided to put on a \"weight loss challenge\" for the office, designed to get healthy! Lose weight! Win some money! There was an entry fee of \u00a32 each so the prize money ended up being about \u00a350 for whoever lost the most amount of weight (% wise from overall.) \n\n\nHow could I resist entering? I tried to kid myself that I was better now, I could manage it, it's just for the money, it would be handy and I could get straight back to recovering, I mean I'm already at a healthy BMI, it won't hurt to lose a few, plus it's % based so I don't have to lose a lot to be able to win compared to the others. It was scary, weighing in front of her, to privately record the weight loss on her chart as the organiser, but I managed and I was proud. \"You look like you weigh less than what you do!\" Um, thanks? The thoughts had started in the back of my mind..I need to lose more, the scale should show less, thats embarrassing. But I cut that thought short. I'm better now, after all.\n\n\n It started off well, just cutting back a small amount of calories, not having as big a breakfast, maybe I'll skip lunch because I'm not that hungry, it's spring, I can have salad for dinner.. until I didn't eat for 3 days, with flimsy excuses to myself that I let myself believe.. all the while comments from others in the office saying how much will power I have, how strong and commited I am. Fueling me.\n\n\nThen the bitchy comments started about two weeks in. When I refused the offered slice of cake as a celebration for making it two weeks. (Half way) \"You're skinny anyway you don't need to take it as seriously as the rest of us\" \"you're already in first place with the most lost so far, treat yourself!\" \"Skinny bitch hahaha just kidding.\" (No Sarah. I know you weren't kidding. But I'm not mad, I secretly relished your jealousy.) \"you're making me feel bad for eating this hehehe\" as the bride to be shoves a third slice of cake down. So, feeling guilty and realising I'm probably going too far down the rabbit hole, walking too close to that edge, hearing that voice inside telling me how easy it would be, to come back.. I accepted the slice of cake. I don't want to go back to my old ways, if I can just go back to normal now I will be fine, two weeks of a slip up doesn't break recovery. I thought. I take a bite of cake. Laughter. \"She's not that strict after all! We might have a chance to win yet!\" Sabotage? I laugh along, internally I'm panicking. I head to the toilet. I purge. And purge. And cry. The beginning of the end.\n\n\nThe comments kept coming. Jokes, laughs, its all a bit of fun. They don't realise what they're doing. At least, I hoped not. How could they? They don't know. And it's my fault. \n\n\nI ended up winning the challenge. No one bats an eye, or thinks that for a month, the amount of weight I lost, seems like a lot. Maybe it doesn't, to them? Maybe I'm not small enough yet? I just did it for the money. That's all.\n\n\nOf course, the challenge is over now. Everybody's moaning how they've put X amount of lbs back on. \"Hey, want some doughnuts?\" I shake my head. \"The challenge is over now! We don't have to diet!\" I laugh. I'm not hungry, I already had a big lunch. Lies tumbling from my mouth as if I never had a 9 month recovery. The longest I've had between some form of disordered eating. Of course they wouldn't know. I didn't tell them. I'm at a healthy BMI after all. This is all they've seen me as, in this new job. \n\n\nI'm not skinny enough for them to think to worry about, because it's just me, I eat healthy, I look after my body. Or, for a little while, I did.\n\n\nHelp, I've fallen, and I'm scared. Why won't somebody notice this is not normal. Ah, that's right. It's my fault, they don't know, and I'm never going to tell them."

The past two years have been a continuous cycle of yo-yo-ing 10 pounds and every time I reached my current weight I would fall into restriction again. I used to feel so gross and big at this weight but now I finally feel healthy and happy here. And I feel skinny and beautiful even though I gained weight. I'm able to see myself realistically I think, I look back at pictures of me two years ago and I looked so sick then.\n\n\n\nYesterday I ran 5 miles after not running for months and I was shocked that I was able to do that. Since 2017 every time I ran I would get so incredibly tired after just one mile so I stopped running altogether but **now I can run again**!! I'm going to run and workout to become strong this time, not to lose weight.\n\n\n\nAlso I actually have a butt now y'all!"

It can also be a way for you to stay healthy while eating something else on top of this plan that you enjoy, though if you add anything you should be careful not to add anything with too much calcium or B3.\n\n[Here's a link to the Cronometer info from this plan.](https://imgur.com/gUcFhWn)\n\nFor supplements the plan uses a One A Day Women's Multivitamin, an Ensure High Protein Meal Replacement Shake, and 1 Tsp of NOW Potassium Citrate Powder. (I would recommend putting the powder in the carrot cake smoothie.) The recipes are both listed below.I hope this helps somebody! :D\n\n**Carrot Cake Smoothie:**\n\nIngredients:\n\n*1 Cup Carrots*\n\n*1/2 Banana (Sliced, Frozen)*\n\n*1/4 Cup Pineapple (Diced, Frozen)*\n\n*2 Tbsp Walnut Halves*\n\n*1/2 Cup Vanilla Cashew Milk or Almond Milk*\n\n*1/2 Cup Plain Nonfat Greek Yogurt*\n\n*1/4 Tsp Cinnamon*\n\n*1 Pinch Nutmeg*\n\nDirections:\n\n*1.

Blend 1 banana, peanut butter, salt, vanilla extract, 1 cup of almond milk, and the ice together. Empty into a drinking glass.*\n\n*2. Blend the other banana, the cocoa powder, the spinach, and the remaining almond milk together. Empty into the glass.*\n\n*3. Swirl the two mixtures together so that each \"layer\" is present in every sip, but not completely indistinguishable.*"

When I'm at worst people see me at my best. \n\nWhen I'm restricting I'm a different person. Restricting 3cats is: \n- hotter \n- more confident \n- more outgoing \n- full of energy (shout out to stimulants) \n- getting chores done, manic cleaning \n- social\n- happy, smiling, out going \n- down for sex \n\nI mean that's what I'm presenting. I'm still a depressed mess but it's not what I put out. People tell me \"3cats, have you lost weight? Look at your face!\" My girlfriend will tell me how much happier I seem, how proud of me she is... (lol) \n\nPeople encourage and feed into disordered eating without realizing it and it just fuels it for me so bad. I don't give a shit about myself and what I do to my body really. So if other people think what I'm doing if good and beneficial to them fuck it imma do that.\n\nI don't know y'all. I need a smoke\n\nEdit; \n\nI read a lot all the responses to this post and have some mixed feelings about it. I'm glad people identify with me. I want to be clear that this isn't what I want for my life. Yes I'm more peppy and I'm feeling good but, as commenters have pointed out, that's what being mid addiction feels like. Alcoholics can justify their drinking because it makes them more social, they go out, they use it as stress Relief.. ect ect. \n\nIt scares me looking at my life the way it is, I want to have a normal relationship with food and with my body. The ED on my shoulder whispers this kind of crap to me letting me sink deeper.  \n\nIf I can be all these things over tired, sore, hungry, on edge, anxious around my friends, abstaining form foods that bring my joy, reliant of caffeine and substances to medicate almost daily. I sure as hell can do that recovered or at least as close to that as possible. \n\nI after reading over my post I debated deleting as frankly I see I am glorifing my disordered habits. But I think it's important to recognize that the reason so many of us struggle with this is how you can't see how sick you are when you focus on all the results. It makes it easier to look over all the fucked up aspects of your life. \n\nI guess I had a very sobering smoke. \n"

He tells me his ex had a BMI of 17 and she was extremely healthy. He tells me underweight doesnt necessarily mean unhealthy the way overweight does. He's met tons of girls that were 90 lbs or below and they were perfectly healthy. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being underweight. There's no reason to try to gain weight if you're underweight. And on and on and on. I eventually unfriended him and told him we wouldn't be a good match. I'm not about to speak to someone so triggering..it actually sounded like he had some sort of fetish for underweight girls."

All I could think about was how much sugar and calories must have been in it, but I ignored it. Then I had mint chip ice cream with rainbow sprinkles. It was a really good day. :-)"

        "Text": "Things that have improved:\n\n1. Not kidding: I *never* think about food. Like, unless it's like \"should I put basil in my caprese salad or should I go to the garden and clip mint to be a lil extra.\" or \"should I take my partner to romantic restaurant A or B?\"\n2. Similar to #1, I don't find food interesting anymore. I don't want to see people's food on instagram or watch videos about food or browse the grocery isle for hours, or read menus on my spare time.\n3. If I eat 5 cookies, I don't call it a binge. I merely ate 5 fucking cookies. It's okay to eat 5 cookies. Maybe not every day because #health but like 5 cookies is not a big deal. \n4. I don't measure my peanut butter. Or olive oil. Or anything else with fat content. Y'all ANs know what I'm talking about and know this is a big fucking deal.\n5. I can have food in the house and not eat it all at once. I can have all kinds of food and genuinely just not think about it or remember it's there. The other day I **remembered** I had honey that I can put on my yogurt.\n6. I don't eat till I feel like I'm about to explode. Well... I have, at a wedding buffet. But it's not a regular thing. I eventually realize I'm full, but it's not even a conscious thought, it's more like \"empty plate, wash empty plate.\"\n7.  When I feel hungry, it doesn't feel unbearably painful anymore, because I'm eating regularly anyway. It's more like \"I'm hungry, but meh I'll wait since I'm eating dinner in an hour anyway.\"\n8. I don't really want the dessert, all the time. If I eat a filling meal, I don't really want ice cream after. I'm full and content (!?!?!? Still struggling to believe this feeling exists after meals)\n9. I can't finish meals that I used to eat ***multiple*** of. If I get a veggie burger, I can't finish it, whereas before I used to eat the veggie burger, and plate of fries, and eat 3 brownies, then follow that with a whole bag of chex mix or some other snack, and ice cream later.\n10. My usual breakfast is 600-800 calories: more calories than what I allowed myself for an entire day (when restricting). Part 2: I didn't know this till writing this post and thinking about it because I don't count my calories.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings that still suck that I'm still struggling with:\n\n1. Hearing a person of any size tell me how they think they're fat or should lose weight triggers me.\n2. Hearing a person of any size tell me how they skip a meal, or how they \"have no appetite, or when people talk about their eating habits in general, positive or negative in any way triggers the FUCK out of me.\n3. Hearing the word \"binge\" even if about \"binge-watching\" a TV show or in any other normal context. \n4. Clothes shopping....... (AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH). And being made aware of the appearance of my body in any way, positive or not.\n5. Though I don't think that I'm fat anymore, and I KNOW that I'm not fat, I still don't love my body really, I just feel neutral towards it. It's my body, it's me, it's temporary, it does the job done, it's cool sometimes I guess."

I know. Believe me. \n\nFucking shit, Susan. I don\u2019t hate you for being fat. I hate myself for being fat because I believe I am worthless in general. I don\u2019t believe *everyone* is worthless in general! It\u2019s me. I\u2019m a piece of shit.\n\nAnd should I say so? Should I wear a big dumb sign that says it? Would you be satisfied? Is That Voice Right? *Do* I *deserve* to feel this way? The mind demands answers. \n\nThis is a mental illness, after all.\n\nI mean, I didn\u2019t wake up one day and randomly, arbitrarily decide that ravaging my own digestive tract might be fun\u2014or HEY, that maybe I was interested in delightfully PANICKING at Social Eating Events where the restaurant doesn\u2019t offer nutritional information! For the rest of my life! :)\n\nIt just baffles me because I feel like people tend to be at least *a little* less shitty when it comes to lots of other mental illnesses, but suddenly you\u2019re a goddamn lepur if you\u2019re at all open about struggling with an ED (or an addiction for that matter). Even if you\u2019re actively getting help.\n\nUnless you\u2019re a famous #recoverywarrior or something, in which case you\u2019re really, *really* actively countering the stigma. \n\nMaybe. And that burden falls on you. \n\nIt\u2019s fucked up. \n\nMy head hurts just typing this out. \n\nNow that I think of it, I should probably supplement electrolytes to make sure I don\u2019t die. But whatever. I\u2019m just an asshole, right? \n\nMaybe I am. Maybe I am just an asshole, and the ED Voice fucking loves it.\n\nFor fuck\u2019s sake, even just here on Reddit, people on unrelated subs get *so weird* about seeing ED Posts in your history. \n\nThis used to be my ED Side Account for that reason. \n\nNow it\u2019s just My Account because fuck it. I\u2019m tired, folks. I\u2019m so tired.\n\nTL;DR: *having an eating disorder doesn\u2019t make you a bad person*, \u201cyou\u201d as in literally anyone reading this. \n\nExcept me. I *am* a bad person.\n\nUnless I\u2019m not? I don\u2019t know. One can\u2019t be certain. \n\nI\u2019m going to sleep (fingers crossed)."

I had a starbucks reward for a free food or drink item of my choice, and thought this would be a good opportunity to ease into eating food I didn't make myself. I spent two weeks picking which specific food item I was going to eat. Finally, I placed the order through the mobile app. When I went to pick it up the cashier told me they had just sold out and didn't have any more, but they could offer me a different food or beverage of my choice.\n\nI should mention that I'm in exams right now and had some other personal stressors today that were overloading my brain. Maybe it was the stress, the hypoglycemia, or the fatigue from not sleeping, but I just lost it. I stepped away from the counter and  started sobbing- I couldn't stop, something broke inside me. Like, full-on ugly crying in the middle of a food court. A stranger came up to me and asked me if I was OK. The barista ended up finding the item in the back fridge for me, but it didn't matter because when I got home my family surprised me with thousands of calories of cake and pie and fudge that I binged on (and purged after they left, but it had been so long that I definitely didn't get it all and I hate myself). \n\nI hate this disorder so much, you guys. Before my ED I would have just picked a fucking different food item and gone on my merry way. But now my life revolves around these obsessive anxieties, number crunching, bizarre food rules that don't even make sense. I'm always hungry but I hate feeling full. I'm irritable and inconsiderate. My behaviour is erratic, as evidenced by today's episode. I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this and I don't know what to do. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself."

        "Text": "I see too many posts complaining about how skinny people are \"obviously lying\" and \"bragging\" that they can't gain weight and eat too much. \nThere are a few possibilities why they say that: \n1. They probably eat one huge meal a day and overestimate how much they eat and feel full too quickly therefore they feel like they eat too much\n2. They literally might have a fast metabolism\n3. They naturally have low appetite signals so even if they eat a normal amount they might feel tremendously full. \n4. They are trying to hide their eating disorder which may or not be aware of. \n\nFirst off, assuming they don't have disordered eating, they aren't \"eating three baby carrots a day\" if they maintained that figure for a while, they averaging a TDEE a little less than someone with a normal weight. For example, my UGW tdee of 17 bmi is 1400 calories. I am literally 30 pounds heavier and my tdee is only off by 150 calories. That is two oreos a day difference. They are literally eating the same amount of a normal healthy person by off by 100-300 calories, assuming they have similar exercise and they aren't severely underweight. They LITERALLY CANNOT be starving themselves unless they go through binge cycles.\n\nAnd if they do suffer with an ED, why are we so bitter? We should show more empathy than project that they binge eat and just lie to others to make them feel bad. \n\nI know this is an ED safe space but we should monitor our toxic behavior towards other people who aren't even doing anything to us. \n\nThere are people on here who DO NOT BINGE as surprisingly as that sounds. We shouldn't mock them or assume that they binge like most of us on here do.  Their thoughts and feelings are still valid and we shouldn't assume everyone binges and if theyre skinny and complain that they can't gain weight they're just rubbing it in our faces to make us feel jealous. This is unwelcoming and unsupportive.\n\nIf you still think that's impossible please browse /r/gainit or /r/xxgainit and see that people really struggle with getting their calories in or watch youtubers who talk about skinny shaming and how it affects their self esteem. \n\nThey are NOT trying to rub it in our faces. If they are, they are obviously mentally ill and this should also serve as a safe space for them since they are struggling with an ED.\n\nVent over."

My soft, slightly rounded physique had become all sharp angles and flat planes: prominent clavicles; concave abdomen; visible, countable ribs.\n\n>i have to admit that, in the beginning at least, as the weight began to fall away, I enjoyed my metamorphosis. All those epithets we\u2019ve coined to describe annoying areas of recalcitrant flesh\u2014bat wings, back fat, love handles, muffin tops\u2014no longer applied to me. I remember standing beneath the harsh fluorescent lights in the dressing room at Saks and thinking, Give me tight! Give me diaphanous! Give me sleeveless! For the first time since I was a teenager, I could take a photograph in which I did not appear to have Nixon-like jowls. I began to look more frequently in mirrors. So thoroughly had I internalized our culture\u2019s idolization of the very thin that I was secretly pleased by a weight loss I knew had to have sinister roots.\n\n>\tStudies have shown that in the minds of those predisposed to eating disorders, starvation often creates a sense of euphoria by altering the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. In my experience, notable weight loss in the absence of caloric deprivation engenders a similar feeling. Even as I worried I might truly be dying, I relished being exceedingly thin. How fabulous to be able to eat whatever I want and not gain a pound! How demented, under the circumstances, to have this thought at all.\n\nOn men\u2019s new attention:\n\n>\tif I was paying an inordinate amount of attention to my new silhouette, this was nothing compared to the attention it was getting from others. Many men, I quickly learned, really do like frighteningly lean women, whatever they may claim to the contrary. As an average, medium-size young woman, I was unremarkable, innocuous. As a skinny slip of a thing, I was something of a sensation. In restaurants and at parties, men flirted with me extravagantly. \n\n>\tBut while blindingly blond hair and cartoonishly large breasts are fetishized symbols of an obvious, stereotypical sort of femininity, I was surprised to discover that near-emaciation also invites the proverbial male gaze. Do so many men really fancy women with the curves of a prepubescent boy? Apparently so. And why not? Men also live in a culture that, for reasons not entirely clear, prizes dollsize celebrities on the one hand and gazelle-like models on the other. Their ideals of beauty have also been formed by such images. (As a male friend once put it to me, semifacetiously, \u201cA little anorexia is hot.\u201d)\n\nOn her coworkers and other women: \n\n>\tI grew paranoid. I fretted that my friends and colleagues thought I was willfully ravaging my body, and I tried to demonstrate otherwise every chance I got. At restaurants, I made sure to eat heartily regardless of whether I felt hungry. If sweets were offered during meetings\u2014those ever-present birthday cakes!\u2014I made a show of devouring some. Once, after I had grown gaunt enough to prompt a remark that I looked \u201clike Anne Frank,\u201d I bought a giant, gooey cinnamon roll, the sort consumed by travelers in Midwestern airports, and polished it off during an editorial meeting. (I\u2019m sure I looked bulimic.) I was behaving like one of those emaciated starlets who gorges on McDonald\u2019s for the benefit of the press while claiming a \u201cfast metabolism\u201d between mouthfuls.\n\nOn her doctor:\n\n>\tAnd what if I had been anorexic? The irony, of course, is that although he [my doctor] may have diagnosed my disorder\u2014without ever dignifying it by speaking its name\u2014I still would not have received proper treatment. Some Victorian-era rest cure consisting of fatty foods (the sort of therapy Virginia Woolf was forced to submit to) is hardly the answer for a twentysomething woman fearful of gaining weight. Nor is telling the patient to \u201cJust eat, just get over it\u201d as though the disease were a question of a quick change of mind and not a quirk of disordered brain chemistry."

        "Text": "Last year I dated a guy who would every once in a while go from love-bombing me to giving me the cold shoulder and chase after a girl from a nearby country he's obsessed with. I never met her, but I spent an insane amount of time on her instagram account, memorising all of her pictures and stories so that I could take pictures of myself from the same angles and compare our bodies. I thought that I deserved to be treated badly by the guy if I, at my then upper healthy weight, was bigger than her.\n\nThe thing that made it near impossible for me to reach a conclusion (aside from my BDD) was that this girl is a master at angles. Despite her instagram being filled with pictures of her, I could never get a grasp on what her body really looked like, because it would always be partly covered by objects or people. \n\nAfter a while my brain supposedly got tired of this and decided she was much skinnier than me, even after I had been told the contrary by a brutally honest friend. So I started restricting. I spent hours a day recreating all of her full body photos. Over and over again, since my body was shrinking and I was fixated on the need for new, up-to-date comparisons every other day. Going as far as finding similar outfits to what she wore for it to be as accurate as possible. I had no hobbies at this point except talking to the guy, counting calories and obsessing over the girl.\n\nIt's been six months and even with this eating disorder now taking up a huge part of my life I'm still in a better place than back then. I've picked up some old hobbies, and I recently got the most amazing boyfriend one could ever ask for, who looks at me as if I was the sun itself and practices on confessing his love for me when he thinks I'm too asleep to remember it the next morning. I'm sick, and it's a daily battle, but I have faith that things can, and will, get better. Despite everything, I feel like a very lucky girl since I have now been blessed with this much love and joy in life.\n\nHowever.\nOld habits really do die hard. I still can't get myself to stop looking at the girl's instagram. Not even to compare myself anymore \u2013 by now I know that I am smaller than her, and more importantly, that it doesn't matter; the guy was an asshole and we are both beautiful in our own ways. But it's like I couldn't let go of it until I had finally solved the mystery. I needed closure.\n\nToday I got recommended a picture in which the girl had been tagged. No flattering angles. No tactically placed objects.\n\nJust her. Unfiltered. Pretty, as always. And much bigger than I've ever been.\n\nIt's been three hours since I found out that the body I starved myself to look like never existed, and I still haven't been able to identify my feelings for it.\n\nI'm not happy, or triumphant, or even proud. Nor do I feel sorrow or frustration for developing a potentially life-threatening disorder over an illusion (delusion?). \n\nPerhaps it's just a relief so immense that I have no previous experience to compare it to. Come to think of it, it truly does feel like a mountain has been lifted of my chest. I have found my closure. I can now have peace.\n\nEdit: Some awkward phrasing. There's probably more since I wrote this in the middle of the night and English isn't my native language, but I think it's time for me to get some rest. If anyone's reading this, I thank you for listening to my story and wish you happiness and peace of mind as well."

I feel like I can hide, pretend to be normal, comfort everyone around me of I can just eat with everyone else. \n\nEating by myself is terrifying. I'm so scared in going to binge, so ashamed of wasting a perfectly good opertunity to be disordered without worrying people. I plan my days around when I can share a meal, and if someone's plans change I often find I can't eat the food by myself."

I would put my hair in a ponytail every day because I was afraid that if I touched it throughout the day I would lose even more. I was losing hundreds of strands per day and I still didn't want to recover; my hair was limp and disappearing. \n\nThis morning I brushed my hair and lost maybe 10 stands. It has volume and curls. Body, I love you, and I'm sorry for what I've put you through."

Your problems won't all be solved by weight loss. I GET IT. But it's also just not fucking true.\n\nAs someone who has been fat most of their life, then became thin (-50 lbs) for a year, THEN GOT EVEN FATTER (+70 lbs)... I can tell you...  there was no better feeling than waking up thin. Waking up thin and not worrying about how clothes were going to fit. Waking up thin and not worrying about if I would see anyone that I knew and if they would see how fucking fat I've gotten. Waking up thin and knowing I could take a good selfie without running it through 200 filters to hide how much fucking weight I've gained since my friends last saw me.\n\nSo many fucking problems in my life circle around my constant struggle with being overweight. My mental health improved, my self image improved, and my morale improved. I was SO much happier. In fact, so much so, that my disordered eating was next to non-existent. \n\nSo don't fucking tell me being thin won't make me happy. I've been both fat AND thin... and let me tell you... I'm WAY happier being thin, and I fucking hate my eating disorder for making me lose that feeling and making me gain so much weight."

They're rude, they're annoying, they have no capacity to stick to their goals, etc.  There are other channels dedicated to posting meme videos making fun of them.  \n\nI've been heavy in my life and I've been small, but I've never been 550 pounds, and I never will be 550 pounds, and trying to really put myself in that headspace and empathise I realised how impossible their lives must feel.  No wonder they can't walk far.  No wonder they're afraid to go outside, no wonder they have poor attitudes.  No wonder they resort to extreme and foolish diet plans that they can't follow through on, because I do that all the time.  I was a chubby kid and I was defensive, and angry, and hated sport, and struggled to get along with people, because I was anticipating rejection all the time.  \n\nIt's a hard way to live and I wish it was easy, all of this weight loss shit.  People on the weight loss subs want to act like it's easy, all of them posting their big redemption stories, and good for them, but it's not.  If I were 550 pounds, and even if I lost 200 pounds I would still be 200 pounds overweight, I would want to accept defeat.  I would want to just keep eating.  I don't know.  I'm sorry I use these women to further my own struggle, I'm sorry they're struggling, I'm sorry we're all struggling.  I'm really sorry."

Some quality posts, if I do say so.\n\nSo anyways, I want to reflect back to this community something that I've noticed a lot of people say, which I think is a distortion but rarely gets called out as such: 1200 calories is not \"maintenance.\" 1200 calories per day is a serious deficit for everyone except maybe my 4 foot 10 grandmother who sits in her chair all day watching her programs with the thermostat cranked up to 90.\n\nIt is typical for people to be hungry/feel like shit/get triggered to binge from eating 1200 calories per day. 1200 calories is not \"enough\" for almost anyone.\n\nThought it was important to call this out because whether you're still in the thick of it or headed towards recovery, the idea that 1200 should be \"enough\" for you is bound to add insult to injury by making you think you should \"be fine\" with an amount of food that will almost certainly leave you malnourished... And the other diet subs also perpetuate the idea and normalize it (don't even get me started on how disordered I think the other diet subs are...and how at least you guys arent deluding yourselves about what it is that you're doing...but that's another story).\n\nSo anyways, if you're eating 1200 or so, that's great if it's a step in the right direction for you....but it's not \"maintenance.\" It's not like, ok you're eating \"enough\" now so you should feel fine now. If you still feel hungry and shitty and bingey at that level, that's expected. It's not a moral failing on your part.\n\nAnyway, stay warm everybody. And merry Christmas."

WHY AM I BACK HERE WHY AM I BACK HERE? WHY AM I BACK HERE AND WHY DID I EVER TALK ABOUT BEING IN RECOVERY BECAUSE NOW I'M NOT AND EVERYONEWILLKNOWTHATIFUCKINGFAILEDAGAIN.\n\nokay, okay, so. okay so. deep breath. i lost 65lbs down from my highest i've ever been and i did it slow, i did it safe, i counted calories and i never underate and i started climbing mountains with my husband and running 3x a week and lifting and i look good, feel good, it all felt so so good. everything was sunshine and flowerbuds on trees, long walks and self love and yeah okay my body is still *disgusting* and i'm still a fucking fat piece of shit with loose skin and sure i could have lost it all already (i go back and forth every day, should it be 15 more pound? 25? 30?) if i had any fucking self control but no matter what i did or didn't do i didn't fucking purge nope i did not i did not.\n\nuntil i did, and i don't know why, and that is the scariest part because i am back down at the bottom of the well and i cannot figure out how i got here. okay, okay, so, okay, maybe i triggered myself by trying out intermittent fasting as a way to get rid of those last goddamned pounds because sure i climb mountains as a hobby but do i have to be so *fat* about it? and god i'm a size 8 but everyone knows  today's size 8 is really a size 12 anyway so i'm still in double digits and that's just, it's not okay. okay and maybe the sensation of eating larger meals wasn't right with me and maybe that's when it happened, because that day in the office i'd just eaten at 2pm for the first time that day (it felt g o o o d to wait and wait and wait some more, powerful and strong).\n\nfive years. i was going to reward myself with five years clean by finally, finally going to the dentist. i know my front teeth are rotting out but i'm not in constant pain -- except the headaches, the headaches started and you can *feel* the way they start in the teeth i know have needed to come out for years. every time i thought about the dentist and the judgment and tsk tsk (like the hairdresser, always with the comments about my poor broke ass using at-home dye fuck you jillian when i do it it costs me $15) every fucking time i just shuddered and put it out of my mind until 5 years approached and i though what a treat, it'll be better now. \n\nbut on new year's eve i drank too much and got too honest with my husband and i sobbed and i told him everything and i don't think he gets it. i don't think he gets why i asked him if he knew how to take out the garbage disposal. or why i have baking soda in my bathroom. why we suddenly have *so much fucking food in the house*. why i spend all night looking at recipes to cook and all morning at work talking about food and going back on forth on what i'm going to make. but i told him, i told him, i fucking told him and he knows and he asked me why i think it happened and i don't know.\n\nhow the fuck did i get back in this fucking hole i climbed out of?\n\nmy teeth are ruined. my stomach will never look normal. i will never be able to eat food without calculating and estimating and picking it apart and smiling politely when i decline the pear slice my work mom offers me because i'm saving my calories for a square of chocolate before bed and chew chew chew spit spit stashing food in every drawer at work. i think there was a little blood in my vomit the last time, god i love that raw, empty feeling. my stomach gurgles and my husband smiles because he doesn't know it's because i threw up the 426 calories i ate for dinner and then guzzled a liter of water. and my well meaning, sweetheart of a coworker think it's smart that i keep tabs of knorr's chicken broth base in my desk justincase i get lightheaded. \n\nso i email therapists because i've lost my way and i was so proud of my streak so fucking proud. and theydon'ttakemyinsurance they'reallfull nonewclients sorrynooneheredoesCBT it's closed door after closed door and finally i get on someone's waitlist and she cancels her practice and i twiddle my thumbs and think well fuck, i already have a weak heart and my teeth are ruined so maybe recovery was a lie this whole time and it was living inside of me, waiting for whatever it was that woke this fucking beast of a thing. \n\nbut... i was finally going to see the dentist. \n\nand now i'm counting out the slices of a clementine, one by one, and setting aside the extra one i didn't account for. i can eat it tomorrow. maybe."

This isn\u2019t allowed and it jeopardises the sub\u2019s existence in the eyes of reddit admin!\n\n* be mindful of your wording!\n\n> Sharing your messed up ED brain thoughts is ok as long as you can see how it\u2019s messed up- those posts helps us realise how warped, competitive and potentially toxic our mentality and attitudes can be when we look at others. BUT remember we have ED folk of all BMI\u2019s with all different ED types. We have normal/overweight/obese anorexics/bulimics/BED/OSFED etc! Be mindful and don\u2019t put triggering/clickbait titles or demeaning generalisations\n\n\n\n\nBig thanks to the people who report violating posts - it makes the mods\u2019 lives much easier as we try to moderate posts asap but life can get in the way.\n\nThanks for understanding ok love u bye\n"

From restricting at 500cals +/- b/p sessions, to 1400cals daily (above my TDEE). \ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\n\nAnd hooooooly shit i felt terrible at first - pooped up, bloated, but I had the energy to study and do the exams to the best of my ability. Yes I regretted what I ate almost daily, even while I was eating it. But I didn\u2019t b/p for 2 fuckin weeks!!! \ud83d\udc9b(Victory 1)\n\n\n\nANYWAY 2 days later and I\u2019m hosting my 21st birthday at home. The theme is \u201cbad and boujee\u201d (HAHA).\n\nPicture me skiddaddling all over black friday sales to find a slinky lil number, and getting my hair bleached and curled, some sharp ass eyeliner wings, a bold red lip, clout sunnies.\n\n\n\nYou guys it was the best night ever. I had MAJOR DYSMORPHIA leading up to it. I had high school friends I hadn\u2019t seen in years coming. I had the damned voice in my ear saying \n\n> \u201chey they\u2019re gonna notice you\u2019ve got fat lol, good luck with that\u201d.\n\nBUT I felt beautiful. I\u2019ve never felt beautiful in my life. The fairylights draping over my backyard and tiki torches and I felt goddam beautiful and drunk. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a shameless list of victories and compliments I\u2019ve never gotten before:\n\n* one of my male friends I\u2019m not super close with yelled \u201cAYE THEM CURVES\u201d as I was posing lol, and like 30 of my guests were just standing around, admiring me lay down mermaid style with sass hahahah. I felt like a woman and not a hippo.\n\n* I had the Hot Girl\u2122\ufe0f drunkenly tell me twice that I looked hot as fuck.\n\n* One of my friends booped my nose and said I had the best nose. It\u2019s small and chunky and kinda hooked and I usually hate it so it was a miracle to hear.\n\n* Those old high school friends? I don\u2019t mean to toot my horn but they had a starry-eyed look and told me I looked soooooo goooood.\n\n* I had people compliment my hair, my earrings\n\n* a Boy offered to keep me steady (I\u2019m a major lightweight) as an excuse to hold my hand.....\n\n* And I cried in the speeches. All these beautiful people I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve lived long enough to meet and call friends. A room full of people cheering and radiating with love and acceptance and family. I never felt so loved in the world, I felt invincible and vulnerable.\n\nI\u2019ve struggled with depression for 6 years, suicidal desires daily for 3 years, I\u2019ve cut myself, binged, purged, punished myself, dealt with abuse from a narcissist mum...\n\nBut\n\nI. Felt. Loved.\n\nI. Felt. Beautiful.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a damn good feeling.\n\nI was in such a good, sociable, anxiety-free mood flitting between my party guests that I didn\u2019t even have the overwhelming urge to binge on all the food. Not to-fucking-day satan.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m rambling so if you read this far, thank you.\n\nHere\u2019s to all of you who lay in bed, not sure how to face the day daily.\n\nHere\u2019s to all of you who hate mirrors, shower in the cool darkness, and hate being physically touched.\n\nHere\u2019s to all of you who have suffered and hated yourself, torn between crying out and locking down into a hard shell of who you were.\n\nHere\u2019s to all of you who carry mountains that we were only meant to climb.\n\nHere\u2019s to tomorrow being a brand new start, a day to try again, to forgive yourself.\n\nA fresh page, a new beginning.\n\nMy victory is your victory.\n\nI love you.\n\nThis one\u2019s for you."

Nobody wants to listen once you say \"both,  actually.\" Also,  everyone knows about anorexia,  bulimia,  even BED is pretty serious to people if they know.  But saying \"eating disorder not otherwise specified\" just feels like I'm  making it up and I'm  totally invalid as an ED sufferer.  Not just to friends and therapists, but even to other sufferers.  I feel so damn fake every day because I don't fit all the symptoms for a clear cut disorder. I  was diagnosed four years ago and I still feel like a fake ass bitch.\n\nAnyone relate :-)))"

        "Text": "I do. I was very skinny as a child and family would always be like \u201cshe needs more meat on her bones\u201d but whenever I hit puberty I gained a lot. If I were to weigh like 5lbs higher at my SW I would\u2019ve been overweight, that\u2019s terrifying to me.\nAnyways, around 6th grade I just remember this being the time I started being insecure about my body and stuff \u2014 before that, I just didn\u2019t care. And then after that, I internalized every single instance of anyone poking fun at me about my weight.\n\nSuch as:\n\u2022 when my grandpa was in the hospital, I got on the hospital elevator with my great grandma and there were people inside (about 3-4) and when we both got inside, my grandma said \u201chope we both fit in here, she\u2019s been getting so much bigger lately\u201d \n\u2022 having my mom ask me to weigh myself and being like \u201cI don\u2019t really want to\u201d but did anyways. She told me \u201c123? You don\u2019t look like you\u2019d weigh that much.\u201d\n\u2022 my best friend randomly asking me \u201chow much do you weigh\u201d after years of telling me how skinny I was\n\u2022 putting a bathing suit on and getting into the pool and having my sister say \u201cyou got fat\u201d \u2014 mind you, my sister is like 12 years old and weighs like 170 lbs so in my head I was like \u201cif she thinks I\u2019m fat, then it must be really bad\u201d\n\u2022 my 75 year old great grandma literally weighing the same as me in 7th grade\n\u2022 me about to break my fast and going into the fridge to browse when my brother says \u201cshe has a fat belly\u201d and then me breaking into tears and going back to my room and then my grandma asking me what my problem is\n\u2022 hearing my brother say \u201cshe eats too much\u201d when I went into the kitchen once\n\nMeh there\u2019s probably more but I can\u2019t think of them right now. Literally all of this shit was said by family too (my friends comments weren\u2019t even bad compared to the others) kinda sucks :(\nSorry if these seem kinda sissy-ish or weak but like I said I just internalize this shit\n\nEdit: so many of you guys are commenting your experiences and so many, if not all of them are things that adults said to you as kids. First of all, why the fuck is that normalized so much? Why do grown ass adults find the need to comment on children\u2019s weight? It makes me sick. Some kids take it the wrong way and internalize it forever and it makes them associate being \u201cpure\u201d with being skinny. it\u2019s sickening. I\u2019m sorry for any of you who have had to deal with it :("

        "Text": "I'm sorry if none of you care, hopefully, others relate but this bothers me SO MUCH. \n\nToday I saved some extra calories to have a vegan marshmallow with half a cup of vegan ice cream after the gym (a whopping 50 calories per marshmallow and 160 for the ice cream). I have been eating very clean, fasting etc. and was proud of myself. WELL, as soon as I sat down with my cup of ice cream and one marshmallow on top, my mom goes \" do you know whats in marshmallows?\" and I already knew where she was going with this (she knows I'm a very \"clean eater\") so I say \"sugar\" and she just looks at me and looks at my cup then back at me and nods her head yes and just says nothing else. Literally what the fuck, fuck off. I have worked my ass off to lose the weight I have and I hate when the moments I decide to treat myself become so AMPLIFIED by anyone around to witness it. Just makes me want to restrict even more :(\n\nDoes anyone else experience this with family members/ friends?"

It\u2019s easier on the enamel, the flavor of the toothpaste doesn\u2019t have menthol so it won\u2019t burn any sores you have in your mouth, and the toothbrush is a lot softer and smaller so you can get into the nooks and crannies and your back teeth easier. \n\nYou guys; be honest with your dentists. They want to help and they can REALLY help reduce harm to your teeth by putting extra fluoride and that enamel stuff that they dry with a light on your back teeth. I\u2019ve had bulimia for 10 years and my dentists have been with me through it all."

When someone shares their story of how somebody they are close to said something triggering there are often comments that proceed to insult the person who said the triggering thing. \n\nI just need to say that running someone\u2019s partner, family, or friends through the coals is not helpful and it is hurtful. Obviously some people write their posts needing to angrily vent and can appreciate being sided with but I also see a lot of hate on normal explaining posts. \n\nIt is more triggering for me to hear people on here tell me that my partner is a bad person or that my friends are idiots and I should dump them than it is for me to hear the triggering things from those people themselves. Why? Because feeling like I have horrible friends and family around me makes me feel more isolated and alone. These people are my support structure and they are my only reason to live and fight my ED. Idk, maybe I\u2019m explaining this too deeply and the real thing thing I want to get across is simply that it hurts to hear someone say mean things about someone I love. It makes me feel guilty for posting my honest thoughts when I need support. \n\nI know people (usually) mean the best by the things they write on this site. And I\u2019m not telling people to change how they respond nor am I a special snowflake brewing in hate or sad emotions about this. I just thought this was an important perspective to share because we should be a community of positivity.\n\nUpdate: Whoever sent the gold my way, thank you!"

Kids should not be thinking about their diet in a critical way. You can choose wether or not to feed your children healthy food, don't bring them into the equation when it comes to dieting. You can choose what they eat, but do they really need to know they are trying to actively lose weight? Let a kid be a fucking kid."

What I eat in a minute, other people can make last for 20. I don't get it. How do they have that kind of self control???\n\nI see this a lot at my restaurant too. I'll set their food down, come back 2-3 minutes later to ask how it is, and they STILL haven't even started. HOW? And so many women will just heat HALF. What is this self control? They say they're full!!! How??? \n\nBut seriously. How do people just not inhale all their food in ten seconds? I can't not do it. "

        "Text": "This is a rant, PSA, story, and everything in one. It\u2019s gonna be a long one. \n\n\nThroughout my disorder I\u2019ve always been overweight. It started out binge eating, I had gained weight from antidepressants and my mother tried to force me on diets. She would restrict my food intake and it just made everything worse. I would horde food and money and use it to buy more food at school. I remember my mom used to let me have 2 eggo waffles each morning. So I would make 4, quickly shove 2 in my mouth and chew as fast as I could so she didn\u2019t catch me. \n\nI always had the stupid stereotypical thoughts about how I want to lose weight, \u201cmight as well just be anorexic.\u201d It was so stupid of me to ever think that would work out. No matter how little I ate, I always binged and the scale went up. When that number went up, it\u2019s like it correlated with my self hatred. I thought losing weight would help me love myself.\n\nThat was absolute bullshit. I\u2019ve struggled so much the last 6 years with absolutely nothing to show except for internal damage, and how the memories haunt me of my organs failing. I remember overdosing on diet pills and vyvanse in the school bathroom. They couldn\u2019t even get an IV in me because my pulse was so strong, blood pressure 210/160. I remember having to consume 800mg of caffeine just to function and exercise, but never getting warm enough to stop my nails from turning blue. I remember going to the hospital because my kidneys were failing. What little urine I made was brown and smelled like burnt rubber. All because I couldn\u2019t stop taking laxatives. \n\nAnd I have nothing to show for that. No \u201cbeautiful\u201d physique like people think. No weight loss. No better mindset. Just more self hatred, scars, and the loss of normal bodily functions. But I have to tell myself that thinness does not determine my disorder. I\u2019m not less sick because I\u2019m fat. I can\u2019t keep brushing off my habits and saying that I don\u2019t have a problem. I do. I need to get that into my head to be able to change my feelings.\n\nFor everyone out there who is feeling alone, or unworthy, or struggling with the same thing I am. You are worth it. Your disease does not define you. And your weight does not determine how serious your disorder is. You can\u2019t just put something on the back burner because you feel like it\u2019s not important. It is, and you are important too. \n\nI love all of y\u2019all and this sub. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. "

People can fast and not have a problem. People can lose weight on 1200/day and be fine mentally. People can exist and be fucking skinny without having a myriad of issues behind it. The difference comes down to the mentality behind a behavior, not a behavior itself. \n\nPlease, as a community let\u2019s try and cut down on the judgement. Let\u2019s not project our own issues onto others. I know it\u2019s hard to remember this when we\u2019re deep in the middle of our own mental illness, but MOST people do not share our deep psychological issues surrounding food and weight."

Then I go out to the shops or wherever and I see curvey or overweight girls everywhere, and they look so gorgeous and comfortable and confident in their skin, and I think hey, maybe if I never lost my extra pounds I'd be ok. Beauty comes from within, maybe I should learn to love myself and not be so harsh. These girls look great, so can I, so why am I obsessing over the calories in an apple?\n\nScenario 2 is where I do go easier on myself. It may not be a binge or cheat day, but it's a day where I don't count any calories and just assume a 'how bad can it be' mentality. And this is when every woman I see is beautifully and effortlessly thin. This is where girls in skin tight gym gear jog pass me. This is where there are girls in crop tops and skinny jeans sit near me at the caf\u00e9. The type of girls skinny enough to not even need to wear a bra. When I can hear Karen and Susan behind me talking about their latest WeightWatchers meeting. \n\nI choose a day where I can just forget about not having jutting hip bones or a flat stomach and I can order spaghetti and a milk shake and ice cream and just relax, and that's when the characters from CoCo decide to go to the same restaurant as me. I see them with their black coffee and salads and I look down at my huge plate of spaghetti and meatballs with a cookie milkshake and think, I should've ordered what they did.\n\nI do really well and restrict and I'm not bloated and feeling good, and that's when all these gorgeous and glowing plus size girls are wandering around, so beautiful and carefree and I just. Can't. Win. I see their normal food ordered, sandwiches or pasta and cakes and treats, and I look at their food with jealousy as I nurse my black coffee and water and Coke zero. \n\nI just can't win."

        "Text": "  So we texted back and forth and, both being fairly poor twenty-something\u2019s, weren\u2019t sure what to do with ourselves for our little excursion. A movie or lunch? Too pricey. The park? Too hot out. \n\nThen he suggested meeting up at our local library. It\u2019s free and air-conditioned and we can talk - albeit quietly \u2013 about our mutual love of books.\n\nIt was the perfect place to meet.\n\nI deliberately arrived early because I needed time to calm my nerves. I sat near the door in an armchair so I could keep an eye out for him. I was a shaky, clammy, anxious mess. What the hell could someone like him possibly see in someone like me? He wasn\u2019t gonna show up, I was certain. \n\nBut then, as if on cue, he waltzed through the automatic doors and his smile \u2013 OH MY GOD, you guys \u2013 was absolutely radiant. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d really show,\u201d was the first thing he\u2019d said to me. \u201cI was so surprised you even gave me your number. I figured you were already taken.\u201d\n\nMy heart swelled.\n\nWe went to the back and he asked if we could have one of the private meeting rooms for an hour or so.\n\n\u201cThis way we can talk and not disturb anyone who\u2019s trying to read or get work done.\u201d\n\nLuckily nobody had needed to use that room because we sat there and talked for two-and-a-half hours.\n\nEverything from our hobbies to our hopes and dreams, childhoods, and spiritual beliefs. Eventually even some of our emotional baggage was shared and why we didn\u2019t think we were good enough for the other. \n\nWe talked and more than a few times he\u2019d begin his sentences with, \u201cI usually don\u2019t tell people this on the first date, but\u2026\u201d and then he\u2019d share something personal.\n\nHe said it was because he just felt really comfortable for some reason.\n\nWe talked about our depression and how we both like to say or do random kind things for people because you never know what impact it might have on that person. The Ripple Effect.\n\n\u201cThat first day in the mini-mart,\u201d he\u2019d explained, \u201cI saw how down you looked. I figured you could use a compliment.\u201d\n\nAnd it was true. The very first day I met him I shamefully approached the counter with an armful of junk food I\u2019d later binge and purge. \n\nI\u2019d been out of a very unhealthy relationship for awhile and was feeling down. Eventually though, enough was enough; I had my own problems and some people you just can\u2019t fix. So I let them go. But in the wake of it, I felt empty and alone; I thought I\u2019d never find someone better who would see my many flaws and still want me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fat and I have psychosis,\u201d I\u2019d stated bluntly because at this point this was all too good to be true.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got my issues too,\u201d he\u2019d assured, seemingly not even fazed. In fact, he found the fact that I occasional \u201csee\u201d beings from other dimensions to be really interesting. He was actually intrigued. \n\nHe said he was hungry and asked if I\u2019d like to come back to his house so he could cook us up something.\n\nI hesitantly accepted the invitation. My three-day fast would be ruined, but it actually wasn\u2019t totally devastating for me.\n\nHe made us pasta. I had a very small helping.\n\n\u201cHave more,\u201d he invited. \u201cI made plenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fasting and if I eat too much, I\u2019ll just throw it up,\u201d I explained. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be wasteful or disrespectful.\u201d\n\nAnd then, that goddamn disarming smile of his.\n\n\u201cEven if you throw up on purpose I won\u2019t be upset. I\u2019ll know you tried.\u201d\n\nHe walked me home a little later and at my building entrance, I thanked him we hugged and he gave me a quick little kiss on the lips.\n\n\u201cText me so I know you got home safe,\u201d I called out to him as I ascended the stairs to my floor.\n\n\u201cI was planning on texting you anyway,\u201d he responded with a chuckle. \u201cGoodnight, beautiful. See you soon!\u201d\n\nAnd as I closed my front door behind me, I broke down in tears. \n\nBut for the first time in a very long time these were tears of joy.\n\nSo here I am, eyeliner smudged, hands trembling as I type this, a huge fucking grin on my face. Your comments have been so heartwarming on my last couple of posts I just had to share. I don\u2019t have many friends and it\u2019s so refreshing when I see victories \u2013 even seemingly small ones \u2013 shared by others on here.\n\nI don\u2019t know where things are gonna go with this boy. Hell, he could say he never wants to see me again. He could be a guy that just wants to get me into bed. We might be friends or friends with benefits or something more. I\u2019m just happy I let a positive person into my life that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.\n\nDon\u2019t limit yourself to your own viewpoint. For most of us on here our perception of ourselves is skewed. We see fat, ugly, unlovable, undesirable etc\u2026 where others see smart, cute, funny, caring, kind.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t always hear it or feel it for yourself.\n\nIf anyone hasn\u2019t heard the words \u201cI love you\u201d today, I love you. \n\nAnd keep fighting.\n\nKeep fighting because you never know when or in what form your own version of my mini-mart boy may materialize. But this world is so vast, it\u2019s out there, I\u2019m sure of it.\n\nGoodnight, beautiful."

It\u2019s about what\u2019s happening in your brain not in your stomach. Just because you can eat \u201cnormally\u201d for a day doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have a problem. Just because you became freaked out by thinking that you don\u2019t really have a problem doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t have a problem.  Of course you can eat a donut or pizza or a huge plate of pasta. Everyone on this subreddit could eat a donut or literally anything else. But the difference is what goes on in your head when thinking about eating that damn donut. "

They are so nonchalant about their disordered habits. Describing low restriction, exercising for multiple hours a day, skipping meals. One girl was answering some faqs and the issue of hunger comes up. She just talks about how you absolutely need to deal with it and push through, and how it\u2019s a completely normal part of losing weight. \n\nThe comments are all praising or complimentary. Feel like if a girl posted a video like that in the US for example she would get wrecked in the comments. \n\nI just think it\u2019s so interesting how different the cultural norms are"

So then I'll usually get two big plates of veggies, some beans and a dessert if they have a vegan one that day. And each time I have more than two plates on my tray I get fucking comments from my colleagues. \"You're hungry today!\" \"You must have something to celebrate!\".\n\nFirst of all - it's mostly vegetables. Those two plates of veggies and legumes don't add up to as much calories as your 90% pasta and oil entree does. Second of all, what the hell are you trying to accomplish. It's none of your business.\n\nNow I feel fucking guilty and don't even want my apple pie anymore. I still have to eat it because they saw my buy it and would see me throwing it away but now I won't even enjoy it. Have decided on eating it in the afternoon and skipping dinner instead :(\n\nI usually enjoy the social aspect of eating with them but today I'm strongly considering never eating with them again."

Which is totally understandable! But as someone mentioned below, it does seem a bit early for her to get online and address this.\n\nI just hope she continues doing well and using her support system. It's been so long since I watched any of her vids but it's nice to see she has kept such a positive outlook.\n\nEdit again: did anyone else think her \"lawyer\"was really young and totally did not look like a lawyer at all? I thought it was her brother."

The message I took from the show was \"hey even if you gain an unimaginable amount of weight you can still be a good person with value who is loved.\" \n\nYes the show has a lot of monsters in it, but it also has deeply loving and good people who are trying (and sometimes succeeding) to get better, and those people do get better if they honestly try. Even my worst nightmare isn't the end of the world. It's helping me accept that it's okay to eat and to gain weight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus if they can get over their ED then what's my excuse. "

I was going to purge, but i didn't. however, i was planning a complete bp for tomorrow. Whenever I binge on \\~healthy stuff!\\~, I have the fucked up ED logic of b/ping the next day bc I shouldn't keep anything down. \n\nHowever, I persuaded myself that it wasn't worth it.  I've been fighting this for so long and I just. hate, hate purging. I never want to go back to purging. Every time I tried to convince myself I failed and always fell back to the cycle. However this time, I made it through. Even if I planned all the foods, the money, the time to bp- I didn't do it. \n\nThis is a fucking tear-jerking victory for me, and I feel like sobbing of happiness. This has never happened before and I'm SO SO happy that I'm able to overcome my urges. (even though I fasted the next day.. anything is better than purging.)\n\n small steps, i guess. :)\n\n a tip: how i convinced myself was bc i convinced myself out of the mindset of 'this one purge wont hurt.' it is, and everytime you purge you just set yourself back. I reminded myself of my sheer unhappiness following b/p and how much i despise it."

I realized it wasn\u2019t good, or healthy, or real self care. It was my ED. \nStill got the cookie dough, but didn\u2019t eat it all. Didn\u2019t have a massive binge. Actually made a nutritious dinner for me and the SO. \n\nMy SO doesn\u2019t really know about my ED, so I wanted to share my little victory with someone. \n\n\nEdit: you guys are amazing and I love you all.

Strip naked even though you're freezing, weigh yourself, update four different apps. \n\nDrink some black coffee, hope the coffee makes you shit, and then maybe weigh yourself again just for fun. Make your standard breakfast omelet (241 kcal), weigh and measure all your ingredients, log it. Decide to eat some beans (110 kcal) right before you leave the house, at noon, because you have been super low-carb for a few days.\n\nDo a bunch of normal stuff downtown and feel ridiculously proud of yourself for managing it. Get really hungry, go to Whole Foods, and eat a pouch of wild salmon (90 kcal) in your car like a complete freak. Text someone about meeting up up later and agree to a quiet evening of tea and conversation. Feel like a successful, balanced human being proving that you are capable of being in public and having a social life.\n\nGet another text a few hours later saying they're inviting someone else to join, and they've booked a restaurant \u2014\u00a0a place you immediately know you can't eat at or even sit inside. Be totally rigid and inflexible and unable to cope. Try texting with an excuse, suggestion to meet afterwards, etc., but in the end just turn off your phone and flee the city. Consider taking yourself for a drink as a self-care type of treat, actually, but decide you can't justify 120 calories of a pro-inflammatory neurotoxin that will probably ruin your healthy streak.\n\nGet back to your little suburban neighborhood and sit in the parking lot of an organic grocery store wondering what the fuck is wrong with you. Buy some vegetables and sparkling water. Wash and chop your vegetables and weigh them, toss them in a pot to steam. Salt liberally.\n\nPut on a giant hoodie and sit in bed at 9:30 on a Saturday night eating a bowl of steamed vegetables (162 kcal), which has been your dinner for the past week and is the best part of your day. Post about it on Reddit because you are lonely and can't have real-world relationships and wow, you really didn't think this would be your life at thirty years old.\n\nTLDR; I have no life. Worse, I'm not even sure I want one."

He has a full length mirror on the wall next to the bed, so I could see my whole body from the side while I was riding him.\n\nAnd holy shit, do I look frail. I could see all my ribs, and my fucking vertebrae too. My hip bones stick out comically far. My shoulders don't look smooth, but rather jagged. My tits are so small that they almost don't even bounce.\n\nSomehow, I couldn't see this in my bathroom mirror at home. I thought I looked slim, yes- but not scary skinny. I managed to get my BMI up to 17.7 in the last month, and I felt that I already looked healthy enough. But I guess that seeing my body from a different perspective made me realize that I'm not healthy at all, yet.\n\nI now understand why both my boyfriend and my FWB (I'm in an open relationship) are so worried about me. I understand why they are constantly asking if I've eaten, if I'm hungry. I understand why they tell me that they are afraid of hurting me physically during sex.\n\nSo yesterday, for the first time in years, I allowed myself to eat until I wasn't hungry anymore. It was so weird... I didn't remember what it's like to be full. It felt pleasant. Comfortable. Like resting after a very long run.\n\nI've got a long way to go still, but I'm gonna be OK."

It's pretty clear how different the food culture there is from here and I've been thinking: It's already hard for us brazilians to deal with body image, but not as hard as it is for North Americans. Our perception of a good looking body is much more related to being a THIIIIC girl than a thin girl (my AN is actually not derived from wanting to be thin, but from control), and our food is much less addictive. \n\n\"What do you mean addictive food?\". \n\nYou have no fucking idea how much you are being poisoned... Here we have industrialized crap food as well, but I ate there the same food I eat here (same brands actually) and omfg, THE AMOUNT OF SALT AND SUGAR IS INSANE! They are completely twisting off your taste buds and creating addictive shit, and all the time I was there I was thinking it must be so hard to eat healthy because the junk food is actually cheaper than healthy food. This combined to a thin oriented culture and I'm so sorry. \n\nSometimes reading this sub I get the impression it is kind of harder for you guys in many ways. Here if you are too thin, people's reaction rarely is about admiration, but concern, guys usually are put out by it. That and how much it seems competition is part of the American culture: Winning. Being the BEST. \n\nAnyway, just thinking about cultural context in EDs. Hope I didn't offend anyone's culture."

For some unknown reason I'm in the bakery section, and I see that someone has dropped a packet of chocolate chip cookies. Like, the really good, expensive kind. And they've gone eeeeeverywhere. All over the floor.\n\nNow, I am allergic to these cookies. I know this. It's why I shouldn't even be in this section. And yet, I am starving, and poor, and it's late and I just worked a double shift. So my brain isn't at it's best and brightest. I pickup a couple chunks of cookie. Which is also technically stealing btw. And I eat them and they're *amazing.* So I take a couple bits with me and get what I came to the store for. And then.\n\nAnd then I go and eat more cookie pieces, that I am allergic to, off the goddamn floor of a supermarket, which has to be one of the dirtiest places ever. In the end I ate most of the packet. I even managed to get most of the way home before the reaction kicked in, and you don't want details of that.\n\nOh also I was 26 when this happened. I am too old for this shit, I'm so tired."

        "Text": "2 days ago I stopped smoking. I knew that I was gonna get hungrier than usual and if I wanted to quit for good, I'd have to eat. So, today, for the first time in over 10 years, I ate breakfast. A cup of oatmeal! And then, instead of eating lunch in my car, I ate in the cafeteria in full view of a dozen people. One lady gave me what I felt was a stink eye (probably not, but that's my ED brain) and my first reaction was to go purge. But I resisted the urge and kept the food down, and got a piece of cake from the office party! I feel like I'm finally getting closer to living again. What an amazing day!"

HOWEVER. in that 2 tablespoon dosage each seed increases by 20% by absorbing water in your stomach. so you feel *full*. for a *long* time. it takes a while to digest them as well, & there's 10 grams of fiber too. literally i just swallow 2 tablespoons in the morning and i have no desire to eat until 6 or 7 pm. \n\nalso! fish. meat used to be a biggg fear food for me. all tbe added oil, butter, blah blah blah. but 3 oz of mahi mahi (think of 4 king sized Hershey's bars stacked on top of each other, it's a lot) is NINETY CALORIES.\n\nAND 20 GRAMS OF PROTEIN?? do you know how FILLING that is??? and it's so easy to cook in a nonstick pan with no seasoning. and my dad thinks i'm eating normally because its a lot of fish. it's great.\n\n\nalso something she said was i should eat more meals during the day if i'm going to eat so little. and i'm doing that now, but not really meals. and it's helping me so much with binges, i literally have not binged once this month. \n\ni'm eating a piece of small fruit every other hour (when i'm not at work) and then like a sweet potato or fish filet for lunch, and my total intake is coming to 300-400. and i don't feel the need to binge, because i'm already eating. \n\nalso, on days i work i make sure to eat a lot of protein, and some extra chia seeds. i work in a kitchen where i could easily sneak a few bites in at a time of cookies/chicken nuggets that'd easily total up to 2x what i want to eat that day. but now if i go anywhere i know i'll be tempted, i make *sure* to get full before i leave so i know i won't overdo it.\n\nalso!!! one last thing!! 5 calorie chicken broth cubes are the best thing ive bought in my life. it's like i'm drinking soup, like a f u l l on meal for nothing."

        "Text": "The fact that eating disorders are so isolating, humiliating, embarrassing, makes this proED ban sting that much more. It takes so much courage to be able to admit to people what we\u2019re going through because there\u2019s so much stigma, yet here we had a beautiful, supportive, kind, nurturing community of people who never judged. Most people irl or even just on other subs judge hardcore and it hurts so badly. The world says you\u2019re too fat to have an ED, or you\u2019re dumb for doing this to yourself, or you\u2019re seeking attention, or you\u2019re a bad person for having these thoughts, and most people use the label \u201ced\u201d as an insult. I\u2019m so fucking ashamed of the person my ED has made me, and I know my thoughts are messed up- I don\u2019t want to parade this shit around, nobody does. I\u2019ve lost so many friends, so many plans were cancelled so I could be alone and binge, so many hours and days and weeks of my life I\u2019ve lost to this shit, it\u2019s depressing. Despite that though I knew there was ONE fucking place I could go to and feel like I wasn\u2019t a monster or broken or crazy, find stories just like mine, have people tell me things would be ok, and find harm reduction methods so I could at least be safe, and it did nothing for me but make me feel comforted. Now it feels like I\u2019ve just lost my only safe place. Back to reality where my disorder somehow makes me a shitty human being and I should be ashamed for having it (imagine if people used that logic for depression or whatever lol)\nI guess we\u2019ll all have to move to the fasting/1200 is plenty subreddits now, because disordered behaviours are only OK to discuss if you pretend like they\u2019re normal lollllll!"

I've started bringing out granola bars for her every morning -\"   he does do this. \"-and I noticed that she will only eat them if they have almond butter, so I've started buying boxes just for her.\" \n\n\n\n\nAnd I was like wtf though and he says, while *staring directly into my soul i swear to god* \n\n\n\n\n\"You think I don't listen or pay attention, but i know what you eat. I know what you dont eat, and I know what it means.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike I've been with my SO for *four fucking years* and he's never noticed a single thing about my eating habits (he thinks eating disorders are glorified diets) and if I do anything super strange he just bitches that I have fucked up eating habits, and if I mention my weight he gets mad at me. And *this* fucker who I barely know has the gall to *notice* I have a fucking problem, and *quietly does something about it like it's no big deal.* I'm shooketh, y'all. \n\n\n\n\nAnd it's all fucked up because I'm both extremely pissed that I've been caught because holy shit that's embarrassing, but my ED brain is celebrating because omg I'm sick enough to be *noticed.* I hate myself."

        "Text": "1) Binging sucks, but any physical changes it causes are hardly noticeable to anyone around you. So please **don't feel the need to go \"hard\" to compensate** or get back to your previous weight the next day. \n\n2) **Drink lots of water.** Most of what you \"gain\" from a binge is water weight, and (ironically) drinking water gets rid of this. Evidence? I lost 6lbs overnight between a day I binged and the next day after drinking more water than usual. \n\n3) If you're in a binge cycle and need to break it, a great way to do that is to **find a high-volume food you enjoy and \"binge\" that**. Sometimes your body just gets super used to being uncomfortably full and the sensation of being stuffed can accomplish the same thing a binge does. I love cauliflower rice (check the frozen section for some really nice mixed bags you can microwave), grapes, chopped apples with cinnamon microwaved or baked (tastes like apple pie), and steamed carrots. Bonus, you can dip vegetables in ketchup and it sometimes tastes like french fries--cauliflower and ketchup tastes weirdly good to me haha. \n\n4) Stretchy yoga pants and fuzzy socks with a baggy sweatshirt is my go-to outfit when I binge. Also **if you have a heating pad use that on your tummy.** It helps you feel a lot better. \n\n5) **Lay on your left side when you go to sleep.** If you just binged, laying on your left side helps your stomach digest. If you lay on your right side it can cause heartburn because the food doesn't go down into your intestines as well.\n\n6) **Lay off the intense exercise.** You can get just as good a workout by going on a long walk. If you've been doing high-intensity workouts or lots of strength exercise or even running, it can trigger an inflammation response in your body that requires tons of energy for your body to repair. This can spike appetite and might get you in a vicious cycle of trying to burn off what you ate, thus triggering your appetite even worse the next time. \n\nThese are \"tips\" that I hope help you feel a bit more comfortable if you've been binging. Remember you're not alone, I've been in this cycle for 5 years. Sometimes you can't stop it but you can make yourself feel tons better by doing these little things in acts of self-care. Just because you binge doesn't make you gross or bad, you just having an eating disorder that is beyond your control at times. Love you all!"

I joined Reddit last year because I found r/proED and realized there were others I could talk to about my ED and learn what recovery and treatment looks like.\n\nI want to thank all of you, especially all the r/proED (RIP) refugees, who have provided me AND countless others the support and assurance we need. You all put a mirror up to me, lovingly challenged me to face my own my thoughts and actions over food and my body, you showed me unrelenting support and encouragement, you gave me advice and were just as willing to take advice. Nothing is perfect, but nothing is impossible either, especially when you have encountered so many amazing people through this community.\n\nY'all are amazing, and I wish the best for each and every one of you.\n\nEdit: omg jk my cake day is today?

People *have* to eat. It's not a choice. \n\nFurthermore I realized that people eat much, much more than I would consider \"normal.\"\n\nFor me a \"meal\" usually means a granola bar, or a glass of juice, or a few shots of whiskey, or, if I'm particularly ravenous, a couple servings of peanut butter. \n\nThe idea of eating a hearty bowl of soup, though such a normal winter activity, felt entire foreign and downright illegal. \n\nBut I did it. \n\nI did it and then I lied down with my laptop and my headphones and lost myself in a scene I was writing, full stomach and full head forgotten. \n\nTo think that the majority of people can do that without a second thought is an envy-inspiring perplexity. I hope to visit this psychological tourism destination again soon. "

I don\u2019t know how I got like this but if I can\u2019t have 4 metric tons of whatever food I want then I don\u2019t want it at all especially if it\u2019s calorie dense like pasta. I\u2019m just so confused like is it normal to have a little bit of indulgence like that and somehow feel satisfied. I think my mindset is pretty counterintuitive when you want to lose weight though as it makes binging such a regular thing guess that\u2019s why I ended up bulimic but this is one of those moments that makes me feel like recovery is impossible for me because  I just don\u2019t know how the hell I could ever again feel satisfied with a single portion of something without bingeing it especially knowing that I can always just \u201cget rid of it\u201d sorry to ramble but needed to put this somewhere "

People associate \u201cpro eating disorder\u201d with supporting each other starving ourselves. But that\u2019s totally the opposite of what it was. \n\nSo i decided to make a surgery that asks about certain aspects of the sub, like \u201chas it made your ed worse.\u201d, \u201chow have you felt that the sub has positively/negatively impacted you.\u201d \n\nI believe that this sub should be allowed just like any other mental health or addiction subreddit. Eating disorders are LONELY AS FUCK. And I\u2019m not gonna let other people incorrectly judge us. I\u2019m gonna show that the majority of people were benefited by the sub and felt less alone/messed up because of it, and hopefully get it back. Or at least allow us to speak our minds. \n\nGonna be posting the link in a bit, gotta put some finishing touches on it. \n\nAlso, do y\u2019all think a petition would also be beneficial?\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nPetition link is [Here](https://www.change.org/p/reddit-staff-bring-back-our-eating-disorder-communities?recruiter=744535054&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=share_petition) \n\nSurvey link is [Here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6XQ58TH) \n\n\nEdit 2: We\u2019re doing GREAT guys! I think the survey is more important, but the petition is also doing great. Survey has almost 60 responses so far, and so many amazing comments. I\u2019m determined to make them hear our stories!\n\n[Here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-J3DJHDPLV) are the results of the survey (for 100 participants)"

The things i feel about my face aren't necessarily related to my eating disorder, they're specifically just about the appearance of my facial features.\n\nNeedless to say I have no idea how my face actually looks let alone how other people see it. I always just assume that my ugliest perception of my face is how other people see me. My parents say i'm pretty but in my head i feel like i can't trust them because they're \"supposed\" to say that.\n\nSome days it messes with my confidence more than dysmorphia about my body. I hate exposing my hideous-feeling face to the public. I can lose weight until i die but I can't change how ugly my face feels.\n\nAnd btw i am completely aware that most celebrities with \"perfect faces\" have had work done. I'm not necessarily comparing myself to other people, these are just the images of myself that plague my thoughts."

The mental health help over there is horrible. I was fat shamed and shamed in general with how I look like. It doesn't matter if you're smart, talented, kind or whatever because it's all about how YOU look like.\n\nGot tan skin? Shamed and treated like shit. Don't be surprised if random people fat shame you or call you ugly because that bloody happens.\n\nMy sister and I live in Australia now (THANK GOD!!!) and the most shocking thing for me is how 'body positive' Aussies are. It doesn't matter if you're an S, M, L or XL here and women openly talk about it. \n\nIn Asia, if you're not skinny, a size S or XS or XXS, you're shamed. If you're not below a certain weight, you're shamed again. Got too tan, shamed once again. I was very shy and ashamed to say that I was a certain size or weight. It's the same shame someone gets when they admit they're a sex offender (no joke). \n\nAnyway, my sister's back in Asia visiting my mum. They went to a nail salon and that b*tch said \"why aren't you as beautiful as your mother?\" To my sister.\n\nWhat the fuckkk??? Who the bloody hell does that? I'm so mad when she told me about it. Why even ask that question? What do they even expect her to answer? \"I don't know, bish. Ask God\"???\n\nI have had something similar happen to me as well. I've gained weight and people, saying \"Wow, *insert name*, you got fat!\" As if I don't know it and they say it in front of other people as well as if it's news to me. They do it with the sole purpose to shame you.\n\nI'm glad that I have mostly recovered from an eating disorder thanks to the Australian mental health system. It may not be great, but it definitely is 1000x better than what they had back in Asia.\n"

Gigi of 2019 will get back into her physical hobbies and stop restricting on fad diets (ahem Day 3 of Master Cleanse here). She'll cook something nutritious, tasty and vegan every day, eating a responsible 1200 calories. Unsatisfying weekend wine binges will be a distant memory. She might have 5 oz of wine with her salad dinner after yoga, but she'll know when to stop. She'll make sure she looks like a million bucks before she leaves the house and she won't shy away from friendships anymore.  2019 Gigi will finally tame the emotional chaos inside her and find a healthy middle ground.\n\nEdit: everyone here is so supportive \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2a thank you!!

I\u2019ve had an ED for so fricken long that I feel like I have X-ray vision to see someone\u2019s ED. \n\nIt kills me. Watching these humans suffer. I want to reach out to help them and I do so by being friendly and nonjudgmental. I always offer a smile and conversation that doesn\u2019t have to do with calories. It\u2019s hard for me to have regulars with EDs because it\u2019s fucking triggering to watch someone use behaviors and lose weight/ gain weight. \n\nI wonder if I trigger any of them who see though. Do they hate me? They definitely have noticed that I\u2019ve lost 30% of my body weight in 2019 so far. I wonder if they\u2019re ever worried about me the way I worry about them. Some of them look so sad. \n\nI\u2019m writing this because I just saw a woman who I haven\u2019t seen in a few months. She\u2019s so emaciated that I wanted to hold her and cry for her. What pain she must be in. Her teeth are rotting and her make up was obviously redone after a purge. It was all smudged under her eyes. I. Could. Just. Tell. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m not strong enough to really reach out to these people and tell them that I hope they treat themselves with compassion tonight because they ARE worthwhile. They are special. They do deserve to not spend every waking minute living in the hell of an ED.  \n\nBut alas - I am just like everyone else. Courageous sometimes but also still timid. \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this- please be kind to yourself tonight. Whatever that could mean for you. Take a shower. Don\u2019t wash your hands 10000 times. Eat a real meal. Don\u2019t eat all the candy in your stash. \n\nWhatever. It. Is. \n\nPlease find just any way to do something nice for yourself tonight. I believe in your ability to be courageous for me- because I am definitely feeling courageous for you."

Last time I was here I filled up 5 plates of bready sugary breakfast crap and horked down a binge before 9am. \n\n\nNot today, satan. I walked through the buffet, made a waffle to bring my husband, and then grabbed two black coffees for myself. I am intermittent fasting and I plan on eating actual good nutritious food later on today.

Ride my exercise bike after every workout and then some. It's so exhausting to keep up. Especially coupled with being at the low-end of healthy BMI and eating a calorie deficit 90% of days. Protein shake for breakfast, salad for lunch, steamed veggies for diner. Ephadrine and caffeine everywhere in-between - day in and day out\n\nBut that other 10% of days, I'll indulge. I'll have a burger. I'll have a chicken wings. I'll have a couple of drinks. In the end, I eat over my TDEE on these days. And I'm just met with comments about my lucky fast metabolism. Then I'll be up on the scale by way more than I want to be. And the cycle continues.\n\nIt's been this way so long. I'm afraid the stimulants and lack of nutrition coupled with excessive exercise and ultimately very little progress is starting to take it's toll on me. I'm working so hard to stay in shape. Every single day is just so physically and mentally exhausting. And I'm wondering, what's the point? My effort is meaningless. ^/s It's just my metabolism. ^/s"

If the first thing they see is 'what is the best way to lose x in x days', 'how do I hide purging from my boyfriend' or 'how do I  convince my family I'm eating' or whatever it is, non ED people will freak out and report us. \n\nWe are all disordered here but we can't be seen to be promoting EDs and encouraging dangerous destructive behavior.\n\nI'm so appreciative for this sub and it would break my heart if we lost it."

It will ruin your health and nutrition and kill you!\u201d  But when people say they\u2019ve just completed a 24/48/72 hour fast, everyone is like \u201cfasting is so good for you!  I wish I had the willpower to fast.\u201d  Do they think that you\u2019re magically getting daily nutrients when you don\u2019t eat anything versus when you eat almost enough?  It\u2019s so strange to me, especially since high calorie restriction has health benefits too. "
