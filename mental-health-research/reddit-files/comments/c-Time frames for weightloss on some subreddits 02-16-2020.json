                            "Text": "Well, join the club lol you're not alone! Maintenance is probably one of the harder things to do, which is why is calls for a lifestyle overhaul rather than a diet. It starts with just replacing things for better options. Like, I threw out anything soy, like margarine, because it makes people flabby and it maintains that flab by giving people too many hormones (estrogens mainly). Real butter has slightly more calories, but I've lost bloat and a lot of fat just from cutting out soy. Now I'm replacing sugar with stevia. There's not a big difference in taste. In fact, it actually tastes better in my teas. I did honey for a while but honey is so expensive. (T o T)\n\nIn short, it's a long process but it's a necessary one. This gives time for the mind to catch up with the body since it's a lot slower to change than our physical selves. I see that all the time with people who dropped a bunch of weight in a short amount of tims. They have a hard time recognizing themselves and their mind still thinks they're overweight.\n\n\nI just hope this info helps because it's helped me.",

It starts with just replacing things for better options. Like, I threw out anything soy, like margarine, because it makes people flabby and it maintains that flab by giving people too many hormones (estrogens mainly). Real butter has slightly more calories, but I've lost bloat and a lot of fat just from cutting out soy. Now I'm replacing sugar with stevia. There's not a big difference in taste. In fact, it actually tastes better in my teas. I did honey for a while but honey is so expensive. (T o T)\n\nIn short, it's a long process but it's a necessary one. This gives time for the mind to catch up with the body since it's a lot slower to change than our physical selves. I see that all the time with people who dropped a bunch of weight in a short amount of tims. They have a hard time recognizing themselves and their mind still thinks they're overweight.\n\n\nI just hope this info helps because it's helped me.",

Although I do remember she talked about having an addiction to exercise so that might've helped. \n\nI once saw an MPA post about a girl who lost 100 lbs in 7mo by eating 1000 a day, so Jordan may have done something similar and just 'omitted' it from her video.",

Nothing else. Same laborious job, same amount of calories, just no soy. No \"vegetable oil\", no margarine (which animals refuse to eat, by the way, since it was created to fatten poultry and they straight up wouldn't eat it), no soy mylk, no meatless meat, nothing. I cut it all out and lost over 30lbs in a short amount of time. My own experiment has said numbers to me that no one else can disprove because they said so.

Dairy is also associated with increased risk of lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer in people with lactose intolerance.\"\n\n\"Lactose intolerance is common, affecting about 95 percent of Asian Americans, 74 percent of Native Americans, 70 percent of African Americans, 53 percent of Mexican Americans, and 15 percent of Caucasians. \"\n\n\nhttps://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy\n\n\nI personally am a mix of middle and eastern European. I don't have lactose intolerance. Out of my entire life, I have never known another European or European descendant to have lactose intolerance until my little sister was diagnosed with it last year. She also has a different father than me and she has a bunch of rare genes. Like, ones where she came out tall, lean, platinum blond hair, and blue eyes. The rest of us are medium height, pale olive skin,  dark brown hair, and a have chocolate brown, grey, and hazel eyes. She is the first one in our families to be lactose intolerant.

Nothing else. Same laborious job, same amount of calories, just no soy. No \"vegetable oil\", no margarine (which animals refuse to eat, by the way, since it was created to fatten poultry and they straight up wouldn't eat it), no soy mylk, no meatless meat, nothing. I cut it all out and lost over 30lbs in a short amount of time. My own experiment has said numbers to me that no one else can disprove because they said so. As for the milk cancer:\n\n\n\"Regular consumption of dairy products has been linked to prostate cancer. Dairy is also associated with increased risk of lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer in people with lactose intolerance.\"\n\n\"Lactose intolerance is common, affecting about 95 percent of Asian Americans, 74 percent of Native Americans, 70 percent of African Americans, 53 percent of Mexican Americans, and 15 percent of Caucasians. \"\n\n\nhttps://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy\n\n\nI personally am a mix of middle and eastern European. I don't have lactose intolerance. Out of my entire life, I have never known another European or European descendant to have lactose intolerance until my little sister was diagnosed with it last year. She also has a different father than me and she has a bunch of rare genes. Like, ones where she came out tall, lean, platinum blond hair, and blue eyes. The rest of us are medium height, pale olive skin,  dark brown hair, and a have chocolate brown, grey, and hazel eyes. She is the first one in our families to be lactose intolerant. One of the family members was born with Down's before lactose intolerance. She has super rare genetics.",

                        "Text": "Well, join the club lol you're not alone! Maintenance is probably one of the harder things to do, which is why is calls for a lifestyle overhaul rather than a diet. It starts with just replacing things for better options. Like, I threw out anything soy, like margarine, because it makes people flabby and it maintains that flab by giving people too many hormones (estrogens mainly). Real butter has slightly more calories, but I've lost bloat and a lot of fat just from cutting out soy. Now I'm replacing sugar with stevia. There's not a big difference in taste. In fact, it actually tastes better in my teas. I did honey for a while but honey is so expensive. (T o T)\n\nIn short, it's a long process but it's a necessary one. This gives time for the mind to catch up with the body since it's a lot slower to change than our physical selves. I see that all the time with people who dropped a bunch of weight in a short amount of tims. They have a hard time recognizing themselves and their mind still thinks they're overweight.\n\n\nI just hope this info helps because it's helped me.",

Nothing else. Same laborious job, same amount of calories, just no soy. No \"vegetable oil\", no margarine (which animals refuse to eat, by the way, since it was created to fatten poultry and they straight up wouldn't eat it), no soy mylk, no meatless meat, nothing. I cut it all out and lost over 30lbs in a short amount of time. My own experiment has said numbers to me that no one else can disprove because they said so. As for the milk cancer:\n\n\n\"Regular consumption of dairy products has been linked to prostate cancer. Dairy is also associated with increased risk of lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer in people with lactose intolerance.\"\n\n\"Lactose intolerance is common, affecting about 95 percent of Asian Americans, 74 percent of Native Americans, 70 percent of African Americans, 53 percent of Mexican Americans, and 15 percent of Caucasians. \"\n\n\nhttps://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy\n\n\nI personally am a mix of middle and eastern European. I don't have lactose intolerance. Out of my entire life, I have never known another European or European descendant to have lactose intolerance until my little sister was diagnosed with it last year. She also has a different father than me and she has a bunch of rare genes. Like, ones where she came out tall, lean, platinum blond hair, and blue eyes. The rest of us are medium height, pale olive skin,  dark brown hair, and a have chocolate brown, grey, and hazel eyes. She is the first one in our families to be lactose intolerant. One of the family members was born with Down's before lactose intolerance. She has super rare genetics.",

                        "Text": "Well, join the club lol you're not alone! Maintenance is probably one of the harder things to do, which is why is calls for a lifestyle overhaul rather than a diet. It starts with just replacing things for better options. Like, I threw out anything soy, like margarine, because it makes people flabby and it maintains that flab by giving people too many hormones (estrogens mainly). Real butter has slightly more calories, but I've lost bloat and a lot of fat just from cutting out soy. Now I'm replacing sugar with stevia. There's not a big difference in taste. In fact, it actually tastes better in my teas. I did honey for a while but honey is so expensive. (T o T)\n\nIn short, it's a long process but it's a necessary one. This gives time for the mind to catch up with the body since it's a lot slower to change than our physical selves. I see that all the time with people who dropped a bunch of weight in a short amount of tims. They have a hard time recognizing themselves and their mind still thinks they're overweight.\n\n\nI just hope this info helps because it's helped me.",

                        "Text": "Well, join the club lol you're not alone! Maintenance is probably one of the harder things to do, which is why is calls for a lifestyle overhaul rather than a diet. It starts with just replacing things for better options. Like, I threw out anything soy, like margarine, because it makes people flabby and it maintains that flab by giving people too many hormones (estrogens mainly). Real butter has slightly more calories, but I've lost bloat and a lot of fat just from cutting out soy. Now I'm replacing sugar with stevia. There's not a big difference in taste. In fact, it actually tastes better in my teas. I did honey for a while but honey is so expensive. (T o T)\n\nIn short, it's a long process but it's a necessary one. This gives time for the mind to catch up with the body since it's a lot slower to change than our physical selves. I see that all the time with people who dropped a bunch of weight in a short amount of tims. They have a hard time recognizing themselves and their mind still thinks they're overweight.\n\n\nI just hope this info helps because it's helped me.",
