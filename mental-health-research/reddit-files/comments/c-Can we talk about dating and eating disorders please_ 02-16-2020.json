Guys can eat so much more without gaining weight, and they never seem to understand why a girl wouldn't want to stuff her face at every date lol. Especially when you start seeing them multiple times a week and it goes from \"okay, date night is an OMAD and my cheat meal of the week\" to them screwing up your tracking every other day.\n\nI've been seeing the same guy on and off for the whole two and a half years I've been in college (slightly complicated, I love him very much) and since we're so close I finally just told him it's very hard for me to stay thin, and if I'm not in the mood to eat much or at all to just leave me in peace haha",

She'd only just come out, and there was a significant age gap (for my age group anyway. She was barely 19 and I was 22 at the time. 4 years makes no difference once you hit mid 20s and up, but 19/22 is a pretty big gap in life experience imo)\n\nI was pretty sad at the time, though, because she was better to/for me than anyone I'd been with before. :p",

It cannot be hidden forever anyway and telling directly is better than letting him find out. Because he will find out sooner or later in a longer relationship. Especially if he cares about you.\n\nPersonally if you told me about it I'd still cook but maybe try to keep the meals under a certain cal limit or suggest to do sports together and then eat or some sort of comprise. And I'd be happy we could talk openly about it.\n\nIf he reacts negatively then it's a good riddance anyway IMO.",

                "Text": "I've always suffered from weight issues and until more recently. In the past 2 years I've been trying to lose weight and be more healthy, and I've managed to lose around 50 lbs (honestly most of it in the past year). I acknowledge that I've lost weight, but at the same time it doesnt seem like enough. I and female 20, 5'4/5, and between 136 and 138lbs. I want to be a healthy weight for my height, but also look a certain way. \n\nI started dating someone while studying abroad in Korea land of the thin people and I think it's getting to me. He's sweet to me (and much slimmer than me), but always wants to take me out for huge dinners and get drinks after. I cant help but worry that he thinks I'm too fat so I've been doing Keto, exercising, and eating about 1200 a day average. It's bad I know, but my mind keeps telling me you still have all of that thigh giggle and a pudgy belly so you gotta. But at the same time I'm worried I've become too thin and I still wan to be attractive and \"feminine\" shapewise. These two ideals really dont work well together and it's driving me up the wall. \n\nMy entire day is spent thinking about what I can and cant eat. Watching nutrition video after video and searching new work out videos to try. I visited friends over the weekend and couldn't find anything i could eat there so I ate eggs, cheese, and berries for 4 days. And I may have picked up another bad habit (chewing and spitting) bc they had candy everywhere and I missed it so much I just had too. I only did it a little, but if I'm being honest the only reason I didn't do it more is because i heard that slows your metabolism and makes you fat.\n\nI'm really worried that I have an issue and I want to stop, but the thought of gaining weight makes me to anxious. I dont know what to do.",

It cannot be hidden forever anyway and telling directly is better than letting him find out. Because he will find out sooner or later in a longer relationship. Especially if he cares about you.\n\nPersonally if you told me about it I'd still cook but maybe try to keep the meals under a certain cal limit or suggest to do sports together and then eat or some sort of comprise. And I'd be happy we could talk openly about it.\n\nIf he reacts negatively then it's a good riddance anyway IMO.",
