It sucks to have an ed and objectively know that you really are fat. Then you try to tell people what you're struggling with and they either congratulate you for not eating, call you stupid and say that you're just \"lazy\" or taking the \"easy way out\" ( as if anything about this is easy) or they just say, eat when you're hungry stop when you're full, as if a fucking decade of disordered eating hasn't ruined my bodies functionality, hunger cues or my responses to them/ awareness of them.

It sucks to have an ed and objectively know that you really are fat. Then you try to tell people what you're struggling with and they either congratulate you for not eating, call you stupid and say that you're just \"lazy\" or taking the \"easy way out\" ( as if anything about this is easy) or they just say, eat when you're hungry stop when you're full, as if a fucking decade of disordered eating hasn't ruined my bodies functionality, hunger cues or my responses to them/ awareness of them.

Me about 60lbs, and her over 100lbs.\n\n Even though we both talk about losing weight (and rarely do it), I secretly want to lose a ton before graduation and make her jealous of me, partly so I can prove to myself I have discapline, and partly to prove to her that CICO works (she's into fad diets, I'm just an enlightened binger), and partly to just be petty because she's blown me off as a workout buddy dozens of times.\n\nGo ahead, put the cone of shame on me.",
