The whole time I was underweight she kept going on and on about how healthy I looked and how I was glowing, so it was clear I was eating healthy and not doing some unhealthy fad diet or starving myself. She even told me this when I was three days into a fast once. The irony. I haven't gotten back down to an unhealthy weight since the last time i was in treatment and that was also the last time she complimented my appearance or talked about how healthy I must be eating.

I have a fucked up relationship with food, I want to be skinny desperately, I want to be underweight, I body check, I compulsively exercise in my room or do micro movements to burn calories, I count calories, 1300 which is supposedly my bmr is too high a number for me, I constantly think about food, I plan my meals and get upset if it deviates from my plan, I get so upset and depressed if I 'overeat' or have gained weight.\n\nI just don't think anyone's gonna care or take me seriously. And there's so many people who are struggling way worse and who are sicker. So yes, I relate, I feel like an imposter and a fake. ",

The whole time I was underweight she kept going on and on about how healthy I looked and how I was glowing, so it was clear I was eating healthy and not doing some unhealthy fad diet or starving myself. She even told me this when I was three days into a fast once. The irony. I haven't gotten back down to an unhealthy weight since the last time i was in treatment and that was also the last time she complimented my appearance or talked about how healthy I must be eating.

The whole time I was underweight she kept going on and on about how healthy I looked and how I was glowing, so it was clear I was eating healthy and not doing some unhealthy fad diet or starving myself. She even told me this when I was three days into a fast once. The irony. I haven't gotten back down to an unhealthy weight since the last time i was in treatment and that was also the last time she complimented my appearance or talked about how healthy I must be eating.

The whole time I was underweight she kept going on and on about how healthy I looked and how I was glowing, so it was clear I was eating healthy and not doing some unhealthy fad diet or starving myself. She even told me this when I was three days into a fast once. The irony. I haven't gotten back down to an unhealthy weight since the last time i was in treatment and that was also the last time she complimented my appearance or talked about how healthy I must be eating.

                            "Text": "Yep, at 18ish my aunt told my mom she was worried about me because I looked to thin and my mom later told me about it and laughed and then went on a rant about how we're so used to seeing overweight people that people can't even recognize a healthy weight anymore. The whole time I was underweight she kept going on and on about how healthy I looked and how I was glowing, so it was clear I was eating healthy and not doing some unhealthy fad diet or starving myself. She even told me this when I was three days into a fast once. The irony. I haven't gotten back down to an unhealthy weight since the last time i was in treatment and that was also the last time she complimented my appearance or talked about how healthy I must be eating.

She even told me this when I was three days into a fast once. The irony.

                "Text": "I've never really been diagnosed, had ednos for a while but it got dropped and because I was working with the same team for years on other issues it was always just known that I had a range of issues with eating and we just worked on whatever as it came up. I've always tended more towards restricting and over exercising, but when that becomes unsustainable I fall into b/p. \nHowever, the only two times I've reached out for help with my eating (6 years ago and late last year) it was because I was stuck in the purging cycle (because that's the only thing I care about stopping). It wasn't a big thing with my old team because they were aware of the whole range and the ednos diagnosis, but now I'm under an ed clinic and they have diagnosed me with bulimia even though that completely ignores huge pieces of my experience. I'm not sure what my point is here haha, ednos is definitely invalidating and I spent years having to defend the fact that I do have an eating disorder even if others don't understand it. But somehow being labeled with a disorder that I don't think fully captures my situation and experience is worse and it gives people a preconceived idea of what I'm going through rather than giving me a chance to explain. But nowdays I usually just tell people I'm anorexic and in recovery cos that to me is the most accurate label even though drs have refused to diagnose it for years. Not that they think I don't have it, just they won't put it down on paper. The whole thing is so fucking infuriating",
