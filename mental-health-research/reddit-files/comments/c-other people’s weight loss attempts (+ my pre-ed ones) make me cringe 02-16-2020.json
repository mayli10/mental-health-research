Changing his diet would have been too difficult though, so he just decided he was gonna eat the same way but also start going to the gym. My friend was super health conscious and even had weights and a bench in his room, etc, and tried to tell this guy that eating three meals a day of fried chicken, French fries, onion rings, and mayonnaise wasn\u2019t gonna help with his weight or his skin or any goddamn thing but this guy wasn\u2019t having it. Spoiler: he\u2019s still obese.",

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile. And again, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s definitely a fault on my part.",

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

With that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI do think in a sub where we\u2019re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be critical of others\u2019 bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile. And again, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s definitely a fault on my part.",

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

With that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI do think in a sub where we\u2019re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be critical of others\u2019 bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile. And again, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s definitely a fault on my part.",

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

With that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI do think in a sub where we\u2019re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be critical of others\u2019 bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile. And again, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s definitely a fault on my part.",

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

They think they can just cut back for three weeks, lose ten pounds, and then go back to eating the way they did before and not gain it all back.  This guy thought that because going to the gym is a \u201chealthy behaviour\u201d, it would counterbalance the 10,000 kcal/day of fried grease he was eating. It\u2019s like people who think they can replace \u201cunhealthy foods\u201d with \u201chealthy foods\u201d and slim down without trying at all, and then are frustrated and confused about why 1200 kcal of nuts and avocados isn\u2019t any better for weight loss than 1200 kcal of Twinkies.",

With that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI do think in a sub where we\u2019re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be critical of others\u2019 bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile. And again, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s definitely a fault on my part.",

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others.

With that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI do think in a sub where we\u2019re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be critical of others\u2019 bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

With that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI do think in a sub where we\u2019re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be critical of others\u2019 bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile. And again, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s definitely a fault on my part.",

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

Saying that we know portion sizes, in comparison to the majority of the US, OP isn't wrong. Most people have an incredibly distorted view of how much of what food is generally good, and vastly underestimate how much they're eating. Fries and a burger every day is not a \"difference in nutritional needs\". I couldn't care less as long as they're healthy, but I think we have a right to say that we do know portion sizes in comparison.",

With that, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI do think in a sub where we\u2019re trying to cultivate a healthy and supportive community regarding EDs, it\u2019s a little inappropriate to be critical of others\u2019 bodies and food choices. I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.

I worry that sort of talk is going to be triggering or enabling to those new to recovery or at a point of struggling with their disorder. \nOP expressed/clarified what they intended to say, but the majority of comments reflect the same perception I got, which which overtly critical of others. However, again, my own personal standards and the way I choose to talk and think about other people\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t mind to put on or expect of others. \nMy initial comment was meant more out of concern than criticism, but reading it again it definitely comes across hostile.
