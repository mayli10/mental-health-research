One of me regular items changed packaging and I literally compared the ingredients and nutrition info side by side with the old one to make sure nothing was different. I like what I like so why change?\n\nRecently Swiss Miss \u201cchanged their formula\u201d and now one serving is 1/4 cup and not 2 or 3 tablespoons. However, I\u2019ve been making it with 2 or 3 tablespoons and the usual amount of water and don\u2019t taste a difference. And when I calculated the calories it was about the same as before. Only difference is it\u2019s annoying to enter it into my fitness apps now. I\u2019m guessing they just want people to go through it faster.",
