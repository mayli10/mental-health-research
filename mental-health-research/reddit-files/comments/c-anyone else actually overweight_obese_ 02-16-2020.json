But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

                        "Text": ">When I think about all the weird behaviour I\u2019ve had, fasting, purging, binge eating and agoraphobia vs the weight I am and have been it\u2019s breaks my heart.\n\nIt really is heartbreaking. My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice.

Basically from one extreme to the other, and I fully blame the development of my BED on that so called \u201ctreatment\u201d. \n\nHonestly, healthy is subjective but for me it was basically not under eat my calories, and accepting that I\u2019d only lost 2lbs per week. But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

Does the \u201chealthy way\u201d imply that you restrict but just like not as much? It feels like Such a gray area. And yeah, I\u2019ve found through this whole thing that I\u2019m fucking impatient haha I\u2019m just like damn can\u2019t I just starve for like a lil and drop all this weight now?! \n\nAnd yeah.

Hell, I'll see people who claim to be my height/lowest weight who look like skinny flawless supermodels and even then I still looked like I was holding quite a few extra lbs. Everyone close to me is telling me I need to stop obsessively yo-yo dieting and get strong if I want to feel good about myself but I have severe anxiety going to the gym, plus I cannot delay gratification for shit. Anyway, I have BDD and think about food constantly. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins. I\u2019m still mentally unwell in terms of obsessive thought patterns and obsession but I\u2019m physically very healthy. ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice.

I went to recovery for a restrictive ED and was taught a bunch of fat logic bullshit about never counting calories, and never trying to achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Basically from one extreme to the other, and I fully blame the development of my BED on that so called \u201ctreatment\u201d. \n\nHonestly, healthy is subjective but for me it was basically not under eat my calories, and accepting that I\u2019d only lost 2lbs per week. But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins. I\u2019m still mentally unwell in terms of obsessive thought patterns and obsession but I\u2019m physically very healthy. ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal.

                        "Text": ">When I think about all the weird behaviour I\u2019ve had, fasting, purging, binge eating and agoraphobia vs the weight I am and have been it\u2019s breaks my heart.\n\nIt really is heartbreaking. My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice.

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

And yeah, I\u2019ve found through this whole thing that I\u2019m fucking impatient haha I\u2019m just like damn can\u2019t I just starve for like a lil and drop all this weight now?! \n\nAnd yeah.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

I went to recovery for a restrictive ED and was taught a bunch of fat logic bullshit about never counting calories, and never trying to achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Basically from one extreme to the other, and I fully blame the development of my BED on that so called \u201ctreatment\u201d. \n\nHonestly, healthy is subjective but for me it was basically not under eat my calories, and accepting that I\u2019d only lost 2lbs per week. But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins. I\u2019m still mentally unwell in terms of obsessive thought patterns and obsession but I\u2019m physically very healthy. ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

I went to recovery for a restrictive ED and was taught a bunch of fat logic bullshit about never counting calories, and never trying to achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Basically from one extreme to the other, and I fully blame the development of my BED on that so called \u201ctreatment\u201d. \n\nHonestly, healthy is subjective but for me it was basically not under eat my calories, and accepting that I\u2019d only lost 2lbs per week. But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins. I\u2019m still mentally unwell in terms of obsessive thought patterns and obsession but I\u2019m physically very healthy. ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

                        "Text": ">When I think about all the weird behaviour I\u2019ve had, fasting, purging, binge eating and agoraphobia vs the weight I am and have been it\u2019s breaks my heart.\n\nIt really is heartbreaking. My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

I went to recovery for a restrictive ED and was taught a bunch of fat logic bullshit about never counting calories, and never trying to achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Basically from one extreme to the other, and I fully blame the development of my BED on that so called \u201ctreatment\u201d. \n\nHonestly, healthy is subjective but for me it was basically not under eat my calories, and accepting that I\u2019d only lost 2lbs per week. But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

Does the \u201chealthy way\u201d imply that you restrict but just like not as much? It feels like Such a gray area. And yeah, I\u2019ve found through this whole thing that I\u2019m fucking impatient haha I\u2019m just like damn can\u2019t I just starve for like a lil and drop all this weight now?! \n\nAnd yeah.

Hell, I'll see people who claim to be my height/lowest weight who look like skinny flawless supermodels and even then I still looked like I was holding quite a few extra lbs. Everyone close to me is telling me I need to stop obsessively yo-yo dieting and get strong if I want to feel good about myself but I have severe anxiety going to the gym, plus I cannot delay gratification for shit. Anyway, I have BDD and think about food constantly. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal.

It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice.

I see lots of posts about binging here but then I'll see their flairs that say they're UW and I feel like shit because how can they binge and still be UW yet I'm a pig. Of course, logically, I know why but it still makes me feel like even more of a failure. I struggle with binging, purging, and over-restriction but *certainly* don't look it. I've been seeing my therapist for a bit over a year now and still haven't delved into the severity of my habits because I feel like I'm just choosing to be difficult and it's my fault I'm suffering because I \"choose\" to eat the way I do, when I know that's not entirely true. I've been a comfort eater from what feels like birth. I was already overweight at 4 years old. It's so ingrained it's like it's in my DNA.\n\nI'm about 98kg right now (possibly more, last time I weight was a week ago) at 5'8, the highest I've been in years thanks to 2nd puberty, alcohol, and inability to find a constructive coping mechanism. Lowest I got was 70kg and I still felt I looked huge at the time. I'd kill to be back there but I'm having such a hard time stopping the binging and (the even more damaging aspect) alcohol. :\\\\\n\nThe heighest I ever was 183kg at 17yos, got a gastric bypass at 18 and lost about 110kg. Gained like 30kg back in two years due to stress eating and then starting T and subsequent heavy drinking to deal with my life situation, I gained like 15kg in 8 months. I've been struggling with this my entire life and you are definitely not alone in this at all. I'm a guy (in case that matters to some?) but would love to talk to others who are going through the same thing. Many overweight people struggle with binge/restrict mindsets (hence why they end up \"failing\" their \"diets\"). Also I recommend people who suffer from BED to check out r/BingeEatingDisorder, I just found out it exists and some of you might find it helpful like I did!",

It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal.

But like, my bingeing has decreased quite a lot, and in turn, so has my purging, so I don't experience acid reflux or anything like that anymore. I don't fast *ever* anymore. My nutrition is probably the best it's ever been, and because of that, I'm no longer cold all the time, *as* consistently dizzy when I walk, too tired to get out of bed, etc. My hair stopped falling out as quickly. I guess I'm just more similar to the average user on r/1200isplenty now (usual TDEE is 1800 and usual intake is <1000). I have more of a consistent, moderate deficit rather than days where I eat almost nothing and having 12K Cal binges every third or fourth day or so. I arguably, physically feel a lot better. Now, I don't know how long that is going to hold up, because I'm not underweight yet, but at least, BMI 21 me feels a lot better physically than BMI 29 me.\n\nNo one ever made me feel invalid when I was on proED or MPA overweight, so I hope to do the same with other people like that. After all, that *was* me for years on ED boards. I know how terrible it is to be overweight and bulimic. Even with straight BED, I know how terrible the BDD is. Like, sure, I still have it now, but at least I feel okay enough to leave my house to go to the store. When I had a higher BMI, I genuinely would not leave my house unless I absolutely had to because I felt like a deformed monster that should have been abolished from the world. Weight isn't an accurate measure of ED sickness; all ED's have their own horriblenesses ",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins. I\u2019m still mentally unwell in terms of obsessive thought patterns and obsession but I\u2019m physically very healthy. ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice.

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins. I\u2019m still mentally unwell in terms of obsessive thought patterns and obsession but I\u2019m physically very healthy. ",

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice.

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal. I get 80-100g protein, and make a big effort to vary my diet, get a lot of different micro-nutrients, electrolytes, minerals, stay hydrated, and take vitamins.

                        "Text": ">When I think about all the weird behaviour I\u2019ve had, fasting, purging, binge eating and agoraphobia vs the weight I am and have been it\u2019s breaks my heart.\n\nIt really is heartbreaking. My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",

But that was too slow. Right now I\u2019m having a pretty physically healthy relapse. I eat a minimum of 800cal per day, and usually get around 970cal.

My entire life has been shaped by my eating disorder and the bullying I went through for years that resulted in me never gaining self-worth or self-esteem. So many experiences ruined, so many opportunities and milestones missed. It's hard to explain to people who haven't gone through what I did because they can imagine it sucked, but don't realise just how much it can truly effect a person. It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.\n\nI have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now. I've been in denial it's that bad because I seem to be able to reason with myself way too well, telling myself that my behaviours are justified but they aren't and I just keep walking around in a circle, going nowhere.\n\nThanks for the advice. Glad to hear you chose to get help. Best of luck on your journey!",
