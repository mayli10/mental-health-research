Also, now is not the time to restrict. If you can, try and eat enough calories (1800-2000ish depending on your activity).\n\nIt won't be for long but the more routine your body has and if it is getting fed enough consistently, it will happen quicker.\n\nHope this helps x",

I realized recently that I\u2019ve NEVER just stopped eating when I was full (been a little fat since forever), so it\u2019s especially hard to figure it out now that I\u2019ve gone through all of my disordered nonsense. \n\nI\u2019ve found that scheduling my eating, eating less calorically dense food (fruits and veggies, whole grains, that kinda stuff) and finishing each meal/snack with a glass of water has sorta helped me (but make sure to get some protein/fat for satiety too). Thing is, binge eating for me is a lifelong ingrained habit, so it\u2019s been taking me a looooong time to get rid of that habit. \n\nThe good news is that the changes are slowly becoming permanent. I used to binge multiple times a week, now I go multiple weeks between binges. So I guess what I\u2019m saying is recovery is NOT impossible, it\u2019s just hard, and it takes a long time. Your willpower is a muscle, and as you train it it\u2019ll become easier to straight up ignore the binge impulses that come, and they *always* pass. Sometimes you have to sit there acknowledging it for a long time but if you don\u2019t act on it it *will* go away. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m a little high so sorry for rambling, I\u2019m not a doctor so take all this with a grain of salt.

Say you need around 2000 a day, each of your meals should be about 500 calories and then you can have 500 left over for snacks throughout the day.
