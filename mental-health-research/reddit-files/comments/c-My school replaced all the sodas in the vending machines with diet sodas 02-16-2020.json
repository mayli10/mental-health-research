You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda. It's almost as harmless as water and is equivalent to black coffee or sugar free gum in terms of calories.",

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda. It's almost as harmless as water and is equivalent to black coffee or sugar free gum in terms of calories.",

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.

You know how many diet sodas you'd have to drink to get any weight gain from something that has fewer than 5 calories?\n\nIt's more likely that your fear isn't rooted in rational thought and is instead irrational, which I totally get as a fellow ED sufferer. I've got foods I'm scared of that make no sense.\n\nBut please know that you don't have to be scared of diet soda.
