I have a pathological need for thinness and I don't expect that you'll understand it but I want you to be aware of it\" and then I take any responses with a BIG grain of salt because, yeah, a lot of guys still don't get it. always assume any answers to are made with guy logic and don't read too hard into anything unless you KNOW they get it. even in a long term relationship where I talked about my ED  a lot, I ended up dismissing a lot of the \"helpful comments\" he gave because they weren't helpful despite best intentions.\n\nsometimes it's enough knowing that they want me to feel better.
