I've been a miserable child showing obvious symptoms of depression for years and it took a suicide attempt for my parents to finally do something about it.

                    "Text": "I'm sorry. Obviously parents aren't perfect, but there's a difference between being blind to some subtly odd behaviors, and ignoring blatant signs of distress (such as a slice of pizza causing a breakdown). I don't think you're a dumbass at all for expecting a parent to be concerned about your behavior.\n\nAnd I get it. It took me a long time to realize that my parents had failed me in this regard. I mean, what did they do when their 11 year old basically stopped eating, started working out obsessively, and lost 25 pounds in two months? They, uh...complained about my keto breath. And my mom just like bitched at me for not eating. And that was it. \n\nThey continued to do nothing as my weight declined through middle school. Random strangers were concerned but not my parents. In HS my mom found an abusive letter I'd written myself in an \"ana\" voice and just silently handed it back to me. The fuck? Obviously at the time I was happy to be left to my ED but now I look back and I'm like are you kidding me? \n\nPart of the problem is that my mom has unacknowledged ED stuff, and maybe recognizing my problems would've forced her to face herself, As for my dad, I suspect he was so relieved I wasn't \"turning out fat\" that he didn't want to see that my low weight was a problem. Maybe your parents have toxic attitudes like this, too.\n\nBut the other ingredient in my parents' failure? I'm sure it was love. They loved me so much that they just didn't want to believe I was in such dire straits. And like, if your parents are generally loving and attentive, I'd be inclined to say that it's unlikely they flat-out don't care. I'd posit that they care TOO much - they care to a dysfunctional, paralyzing extent.\n\nEither way, I'm so sorry you're going through this. You're 100% valid, and if you're looking for real-life help, I do hope you find a way to get it.",

I started restricting at 9 years old bc I was constantly told I was fat and needed to lose some, plus I was super self conscious and compared myself to others every second of every day. I went in to my hospital and the nurses got my to weigh myself, like normal. When the scale said I have lost 10kg in a month ALL the nurses were asking me 'how I did it' 'that's amazing' and no one asked questions, just congratulated me.
