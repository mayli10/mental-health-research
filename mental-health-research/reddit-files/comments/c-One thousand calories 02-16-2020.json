But the average American woman (Who is 5\u20194 and sedentary) needs significantly less than that and I frequently see recovery blogs trying to convince their followers that ALL people need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day and anyone eating under that is STARVING THEMSELVES.

It would be better for these blogs to say \u201cyour caloric needs are super dependent on a lot of factors and it\u2019s important to know what you need. Women need anywhere from 1200-2100 a day!

But the average American woman (Who is 5\u20194 and sedentary) needs significantly less than that and I frequently see recovery blogs trying to convince their followers that ALL people need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day and anyone eating under that is STARVING THEMSELVES.  And I think that will only lead to people overeating and then feeling like their body is \u201cbroken\u201d because they gained weight and resort to drastic measures to lose it. It would be better for these blogs to say \u201cyour caloric needs are super dependent on a lot of factors and it\u2019s important to know what you need. Women need anywhere from 1200-2100 a day!  You need to give your body what it needs!\u201d Or something like that.",

                        "Text": "Sure, but that\u2019s not really the point I was trying to make. Of course there are people with higher TDEEs and BMRs than mine.  2100 isn\u2019t a ridiculous number and it\u2019s great for people whose TDEE allow that. But the average American woman (Who is 5\u20194 and sedentary) needs significantly less than that and I frequently see recovery blogs trying to convince their followers that ALL people need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day and anyone eating under that is STARVING THEMSELVES.  And I think that will only lead to people overeating and then feeling like their body is \u201cbroken\u201d because they gained weight and resort to drastic measures to lose it. It would be better for these blogs to say \u201cyour caloric needs are super dependent on a lot of factors and it\u2019s important to know what you need. Women need anywhere from 1200-2100 a day!  You need to give your body what it needs!\u201d Or something like that.",

Litterally tattoo \"reality check\" on your hands if that's what it takes, because God knows I would if that was all it took. \n\nReality checks are great, if you are still in contact with reality. When you're deep into disordered thinking, though, it really can rub you the wrong way. \n\n\nThink about anxiety. It can help some people with minor anxiety to be told to \"not think about it\" but if you have a severe panic disorder not only is it not helpful but it becomes a sign of who not to confide in because they clearly dont understand and only make you feel more \"weird\" or isolated or different.",

Of course there are people with higher TDEEs and BMRs than mine.  2100 isn\u2019t a ridiculous number and it\u2019s great for people whose TDEE allow that. But the average American woman (Who is 5\u20194 and sedentary) needs significantly less than that and I frequently see recovery blogs trying to convince their followers that ALL people need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day and anyone eating under that is STARVING THEMSELVES.  And I think that will only lead to people overeating and then feeling like their body is \u201cbroken\u201d because they gained weight and resort to drastic measures to lose it. It would be better for these blogs to say \u201cyour caloric needs are super dependent on a lot of factors and it\u2019s important to know what you need. Women need anywhere from 1200-2100 a day!  You need to give your body what it needs!\u201d Or something like that.",

Litterally tattoo \"reality check\" on your hands if that's what it takes, because God knows I would if that was all it took. \n\nReality checks are great, if you are still in contact with reality. When you're deep into disordered thinking, though, it really can rub you the wrong way. \n\n\nThink about anxiety. It can help some people with minor anxiety to be told to \"not think about it\" but if you have a severe panic disorder not only is it not helpful but it becomes a sign of who not to confide in because they clearly dont understand and only make you feel more \"weird\" or isolated or different.",

Of course there are people with higher TDEEs and BMRs than mine.  2100 isn\u2019t a ridiculous number and it\u2019s great for people whose TDEE allow that. But the average American woman (Who is 5\u20194 and sedentary) needs significantly less than that and I frequently see recovery blogs trying to convince their followers that ALL people need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day and anyone eating under that is STARVING THEMSELVES.  And I think that will only lead to people overeating and then feeling like their body is \u201cbroken\u201d because they gained weight and resort to drastic measures to lose it. It would be better for these blogs to say \u201cyour caloric needs are super dependent on a lot of factors and it\u2019s important to know what you need. Women need anywhere from 1200-2100 a day!  You need to give your body what it needs!\u201d Or something like that.",

Of course there are people with higher TDEEs and BMRs than mine.  2100 isn\u2019t a ridiculous number and it\u2019s great for people whose TDEE allow that. But the average American woman (Who is 5\u20194 and sedentary) needs significantly less than that and I frequently see recovery blogs trying to convince their followers that ALL people need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day and anyone eating under that is STARVING THEMSELVES.  And I think that will only lead to people overeating and then feeling like their body is \u201cbroken\u201d because they gained weight and resort to drastic measures to lose it. It would be better for these blogs to say \u201cyour caloric needs are super dependent on a lot of factors and it\u2019s important to know what you need. Women need anywhere from 1200-2100 a day!  You need to give your body what it needs!\u201d Or something like that.",

Of course there are people with higher TDEEs and BMRs than mine.  2100 isn\u2019t a ridiculous number and it\u2019s great for people whose TDEE allow that. But the average American woman (Who is 5\u20194 and sedentary) needs significantly less than that and I frequently see recovery blogs trying to convince their followers that ALL people need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day and anyone eating under that is STARVING THEMSELVES.  And I think that will only lead to people overeating and then feeling like their body is \u201cbroken\u201d because they gained weight and resort to drastic measures to lose it. It would be better for these blogs to say \u201cyour caloric needs are super dependent on a lot of factors and it\u2019s important to know what you need. Women need anywhere from 1200-2100 a day!  You need to give your body what it needs!\u201d Or something like that.",
