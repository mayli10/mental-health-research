Maybe the employee is just some white teenage girl. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually have a lot to lose. But I\u2019m not really comfortable with this attitude being the norm. We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better.

It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first.

It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first.

Maybe the employee is just some white teenage girl. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually have a lot to lose. But I\u2019m not really comfortable with this attitude being the norm. We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better.

People stop coming because the cashiers are notoriously rude, they don\u2019t need as many people because less customers, several people get laid off, maybe even the store closes and everyone loses their jobs. \n\nNow that situation is making a lot of assumptions but so are you in every comment in this thread when you\u2019re saying she doesn\u2019t deserve to be reported for this reason or that. \n\nIn the end it\u2019s up to OP and it seems the general consensus is this thread is the girl was rude and overstepped her bounds, not just a \u201cfuck up\u201d like you keep saying",

It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first. People are probably going to see this relation as a stretch, but I don't know what to tell you, these are just my experiences as a person of color.",

It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first.

If there\u2019s a way to go around possible worse scenarios for a person equally vulnerable then let\u2019s avoid those scenarios. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to confront the cashier. If OP wants a friend to do it then that\u2019s okay too. But no one here seems to think speaking directly to the manager could potentially be dangerous for the employee. Maybe the employee is just some white teenage girl. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually have a lot to lose. But I\u2019m not really comfortable with this attitude being the norm. We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better. Consider who the manager could be? What if it\u2019s some guy who\u2019s a dick? I know I\u2019m just going to keep getting downvoted for offering alternatives but everyone here is sounding like suburban white moms wanting everyone to be brought to their knees when someone does something wrong. Best case scenario someone pulls her aside and says hey you can\u2019t do that, she feels bad and doesn\u2019t do it again. But we don\u2019t *have* to get employers involved every single time something happens.",

It's like when people call the police on nonwhites for being loud. It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first. People are probably going to see this relation as a stretch, but I don't know what to tell you, these are just my experiences as a person of color.",

If there\u2019s a way to go around possible worse scenarios for a person equally vulnerable then let\u2019s avoid those scenarios. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to confront the cashier. If OP wants a friend to do it then that\u2019s okay too. But no one here seems to think speaking directly to the manager could potentially be dangerous for the employee. Maybe the employee is just some white teenage girl. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually have a lot to lose. But I\u2019m not really comfortable with this attitude being the norm. We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better. Consider who the manager could be? What if it\u2019s some guy who\u2019s a dick? I know I\u2019m just going to keep getting downvoted for offering alternatives but everyone here is sounding like suburban white moms wanting everyone to be brought to their knees when someone does something wrong. Best case scenario someone pulls her aside and says hey you can\u2019t do that, she feels bad and doesn\u2019t do it again. But we don\u2019t *have* to get employers involved every single time something happens.",

It's like when people call the police on nonwhites for being loud. It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first. People are probably going to see this relation as a stretch, but I don't know what to tell you, these are just my experiences as a person of color.",

If there\u2019s a way to go around possible worse scenarios for a person equally vulnerable then let\u2019s avoid those scenarios. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to confront the cashier. If OP wants a friend to do it then that\u2019s okay too. But no one here seems to think speaking directly to the manager could potentially be dangerous for the employee. Maybe the employee is just some white teenage girl. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually have a lot to lose. But I\u2019m not really comfortable with this attitude being the norm. We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better. Consider who the manager could be? What if it\u2019s some guy who\u2019s a dick? I know I\u2019m just going to keep getting downvoted for offering alternatives but everyone here is sounding like suburban white moms wanting everyone to be brought to their knees when someone does something wrong. Best case scenario someone pulls her aside and says hey you can\u2019t do that, she feels bad and doesn\u2019t do it again. But we don\u2019t *have* to get employers involved every single time something happens.",

It's like when people call the police on nonwhites for being loud. It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first. People are probably going to see this relation as a stretch, but I don't know what to tell you, these are just my experiences as a person of color.",

If there\u2019s a way to go around possible worse scenarios for a person equally vulnerable then let\u2019s avoid those scenarios. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to confront the cashier. If OP wants a friend to do it then that\u2019s okay too. But no one here seems to think speaking directly to the manager could potentially be dangerous for the employee. Maybe the employee is just some white teenage girl. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually have a lot to lose. But I\u2019m not really comfortable with this attitude being the norm. We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better. Consider who the manager could be? What if it\u2019s some guy who\u2019s a dick? I know I\u2019m just going to keep getting downvoted for offering alternatives but everyone here is sounding like suburban white moms wanting everyone to be brought to their knees when someone does something wrong. Best case scenario someone pulls her aside and says hey you can\u2019t do that, she feels bad and doesn\u2019t do it again.

It's like when people call the police on nonwhites for being loud. It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first. People are probably going to see this relation as a stretch, but I don't know what to tell you, these are just my experiences as a person of color.",

If there\u2019s a way to go around possible worse scenarios for a person equally vulnerable then let\u2019s avoid those scenarios. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to confront the cashier. If OP wants a friend to do it then that\u2019s okay too. But no one here seems to think speaking directly to the manager could potentially be dangerous for the employee. Maybe the employee is just some white teenage girl. Maybe she doesn\u2019t actually have a lot to lose. But I\u2019m not really comfortable with this attitude being the norm. We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better. Consider who the manager could be? What if it\u2019s some guy who\u2019s a dick? I know I\u2019m just going to keep getting downvoted for offering alternatives but everyone here is sounding like suburban white moms wanting everyone to be brought to their knees when someone does something wrong. Best case scenario someone pulls her aside and says hey you can\u2019t do that, she feels bad and doesn\u2019t do it again.

It's like when people call the police on nonwhites for being loud. It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first. People are probably going to see this relation as a stretch, but I don't know what to tell you, these are just my experiences as a person of color.",

It's like when people call the police on nonwhites for being loud. It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first. People are probably going to see this relation as a stretch, but I don't know what to tell you, these are just my experiences as a person of color.",

It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first.

We need to care about others even when they fuck up in casual situations like this because making others feel bad just because they were being ignorant doesn\u2019t make things better.

It's better to go talk to them yourselves and building community instead of having someone else with way more authority over them do it. The way we act in every day life is going to impact how we act when something \"bigger\" comes along. I'm obsessed with praxis so there's that. But yeah, everyone thinks I'm condoning the behavior just because I disagree about going to the manager first and foremost when the option to talk to them directly is there. Especially if you frequent the store. Like, what if the manager doesn't even get it? A lot of people are really into commenting about people's stuff, food, and everything (from my experience and all the stuff I see here). I just see it as good practice to be able to stand up for oneself without using authority first.
