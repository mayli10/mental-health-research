                        "Text": "\u201cSafe, sane, consensual\u201d addresses that; it specifies that risks are reasonably communicated, and that within reason, safety precautions are taken (somebody into bondage should always have a pair of trauma shears around; somebody doing fireplay should learn about the substances involved and what to do if things get out of hand or a mistake is made). \n\nWhen it comes to wanting to control somebody\u2019s actions? That\u2019s a domination fantasy, likely a fetish. \n\nSomebody who gets off from pedophilia is distinguished from somebody engaging in age play, due to the consent factor (and sometimes the sexual interest varies... I\u2019m not sure how to word this particular aspect). So, the consent plays a big role in conversations like these. In our culture, we are not able to give consent to others, until over 18 (or 17/16 depending on the other party, location, etc). So what distinguishes one from the other (to me at least, and legally), is the consent and willing participant.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that not all fetishes occur in the context of BDSM (ie., voyeur cannibals, etc., all exist as fetishes, but we rather don\u2019t see them in BDSM, or we see them - like voyeurism- in a way that emphasizes consent).  So yes, he is a pedophile. But he also violated somebody\u2019s consent, and seems to have a fetish that he has no impulse control over (or just doesn\u2019t give a shit and thinks he had the right to do such things).",
