I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day.

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you! I've got a whole giant tub of it to use up.",

Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness.\nGreat hack, thank you!

                            "Text": "Almonds are 30 cal for 5g. One of my favorite things is 150g two good vanilla yogurt (80), 5g each chopped almonds (30) and whole grain quick oats (20) toasted in a dry pan, 1tsp sugar free maple syrup (1), 1/2tsp chia seeds (8), and either frozen strawberries or mango chunks or some chopped apple or sliced banana depending how many calories I'm willing to have that day. So roughly 140 cal not including the fruit.",

                            "Text": "Almonds have been mentioned, but cashews are great too!!! Lowest per 100 grams, and very mild in flavour. You can even make vegan cheese with it! Which is great when you want to try cheese but are intimidated by buying it. I also love pistachios which are also low kcal, and they're green, which is always fun. \n\nYou can buy a nut mix and experiment, so you can decide which ones you like without spending a ton. Some places have nut vending machines where you can make your own mix, even some cheapo supermarkets like Lidl! \n\nYou can use nuts on top of salads! To make it less intimidating I recommend chopping them up and sprinkling it, making it look fancy. I do it with mozzarella too.",

                        "Text": "Definitely love using them in salad. My go-to salad is: \n\n40g kale, 23g spinach, 14g shredded carrots, 26g onion, 34g mini cucumber, 25g strawberries (I use frozen and just slice them), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g chopped almonds. \n\nMassage the kale, trust me.. don't skip this step. Then add everything else in. \n\nFor the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1/2tbsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper \n\nWhisk together and pour over salad. Toss to coat. \n\n176 cal. \n\nCan top with some roasted chickpeas or chicken or maybe baked tofu just to bulk it up even more and add protein. It's great on its own as well though.",
