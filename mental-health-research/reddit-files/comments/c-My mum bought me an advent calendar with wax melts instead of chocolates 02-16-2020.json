Mine was diagnosed with stage 3, but some tests made them think that it had progressed to stage 4 while she was waiting to start chemo. I came home and went with her to the ultrasound.

So sorry for your mother, it was very nice of her to think of your needs in a moment of such concern.\nThough I think I would still want the chocolate ahaha ED can go fuck itself over one small chocolate a day (at least I'm happy I can see it that way). I always make homemade calendars with healthy sweets I bake, or sugarfree chocolate.",
