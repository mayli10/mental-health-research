Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon.

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",

Not because everyone who fits that definition is an asshole, but because the people who are an asshole and also fit that definition suddenly feel like they are god's gift to the overweight. They've lost 5kg by dropping soda and crossfitting their way through half a free weights set, so OBVIOUSLY they know everything there is to know about weight loss and fitness, and if someone can't lose 100kg by doing the same thing then obviously the problem is them!\n\nFriend of mine is the same. Thinks he has weight loss/fitness figured out because he keeps yoyoing through the same 10kg by hopping on and off the Atkins- I mean keto wagon. Extraordinarily frustrating.\n\nSorry your brother is such a miserable little loser. I'll eat him if you like.",
