                    "Text": "PLEASE don't feel this way. I cannot stress enough how much this is the wrong attitude and it kills me to know anybody would feel this. \n\nI am almost 29, been in long relationships ever since I was 19, including a 3-year (disasterous) marriage. \n\nWhat I learned on my flesh is that the one who constantly, constantly brought me down and urged me to go on starving myself never cheated on me. My current partner, on the other hand, constantly compliments me right from the beginning, is obsessed with my body (which has been curvy for the last few months), and he cheated. It's the first time in my life I've been cheated on, and I honestly thought everything was perfect.\n\nAll of this long ramble is to say to anyone who's reading it that the cheating is, almost always, never about you, but the cheater themselves. If they wanna cheat or rather find somone else, they're gonna do it whether they think your body is gorgeous and ideal and whether they think you should gain/lose weight. It is about them and about their entitlement/moral compass, or whatever is going on in their twisted head at the time. \n\nEating disorders SUCK. Do not let yourself suffer even more by connecting cheating or possible abandonment to your weight.",
