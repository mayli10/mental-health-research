That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

I understand you\u2019ve been hurt, and it can be really hard not to pin the blame on demographics of people, especially when it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve seen that pattern of behavior from them (I know I sure as hell do this a lot), but that still doesn\u2019t justify it. \n\nYou can\u2019t claim to to say that you didn\u2019t intend to attack men who don\u2019t participate in these actions when that\u2019s not what you said in the post.  Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do. It sounds like you\u2019ve been put through some shit by some horrible people, but there\u2019s no reason to make people like me and the poster above take the brunt of your retaliation, especially considering this is forum for people going through similar problems.",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

I understand you\u2019ve been hurt, and it can be really hard not to pin the blame on demographics of people, especially when it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve seen that pattern of behavior from them (I know I sure as hell do this a lot), but that still doesn\u2019t justify it. \n\nYou can\u2019t claim to to say that you didn\u2019t intend to attack men who don\u2019t participate in these actions when that\u2019s not what you said in the post.  Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do. It sounds like you\u2019ve been put through some shit by some horrible people, but there\u2019s no reason to make people like me and the poster above take the brunt of your retaliation, especially considering this is forum for people going through similar problems.",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

I understand you\u2019ve been hurt, and it can be really hard not to pin the blame on demographics of people, especially when it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve seen that pattern of behavior from them (I know I sure as hell do this a lot), but that still doesn\u2019t justify it. \n\nYou can\u2019t claim to to say that you didn\u2019t intend to attack men who don\u2019t participate in these actions when that\u2019s not what you said in the post.  Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do.

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins.

You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that!

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated. Let's open the door to conversation with asking each other why we believe what we claim to believe.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated. Let's open the door to conversation with asking each other why we believe what we claim to believe.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not.

I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated. Let's open the door to conversation with asking each other why we believe what we claim to believe.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

Hey dumbass, this was caused by YEARS of trauma and bad coping; you taking five seconds to say \"eat more\" or \"try meditating\" isn't going to just magically fix it.\n\nIt's kind of offensive, honestly. Maybe I'm oversensitive, but them thinking they can just fix me by telling me I'd look better with curves is incredibly insulting and invalidates the years and years I've spent in therapy and treatment. Like, if dozens of trained professionals in the goddamn hospital couldn't make me get better, what makes you think you're so fucking special?\n\nObviously, not all men do this, and I've known a few who were absolutely lovely and respectful and never made me feel invalid.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated. Let's open the door to conversation with asking each other why we believe what we claim to believe.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do. It sounds like you\u2019ve been put through some shit by some horrible people, but there\u2019s no reason to make people like me and the poster above take the brunt of your retaliation, especially considering this is forum for people going through similar problems.",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

All you can do is continue supporting her and encourage her to make healthy choices, validate her outside of her appearance, and encourage her to widen her support network (preferably with professional help), especially if she's underweight as those with EDs and very low BMIs can suffer from heart attacks even if they are incredibly young since they are destroying their cardiac tissue.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

I understand you\u2019ve been hurt, and it can be really hard not to pin the blame on demographics of people, especially when it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve seen that pattern of behavior from them (I know I sure as hell do this a lot), but that still doesn\u2019t justify it. \n\nYou can\u2019t claim to to say that you didn\u2019t intend to attack men who don\u2019t participate in these actions when that\u2019s not what you said in the post.  Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do. It sounds like you\u2019ve been put through some shit by some horrible people, but there\u2019s no reason to make people like me and the poster above take the brunt of your retaliation, especially considering this is forum for people going through similar problems.",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do.

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated. Let's open the door to conversation with asking each other why we believe what we claim to believe.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated. Let's open the door to conversation with asking each other why we believe what we claim to believe.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not.

Even though we broke up due to her ED (her choice) we remain close friends. I was also the first and only person she told when she went to a weekly recovery program. I'd talk to her every Wednesday after the session, send funny memes and just check in. I love her dearly and would do anything to see her get better, including putting my feelings for her in a box so that she has a friend she can trust.\nIt still breaks my heart to see the pain and self hatred she holds onto and I do what I can to help but I know her illness is not my responsibility though and it's her job to get better.\n\nI didn't share this to brag or anything, just let you know that there are guys out there who will love you as a whole. ED included.\n\nI hope you find happiness and genuine connection. It's out there",

Don't tell her she's too skinny, don't tell her she's not too big. Never tell her to eat more, in fact, don't ever make comments on her meal choices. If she makes any suggestion to go out to eat, you go with her and eat what she wants. If she doesn't seem to be doing much of that, comment that you sure are hungry and you'd like it if she went to XYZ with you. The important thing is to treat lightly and be aware that comments about her appearance can fuel the disordered eating. You look healthy will sound to her as \"you look fat,\" telling her you look sick is telling her, \"it's working you finally look thin,\" telling her she's already beautiful is telling her, \"you're only beautiful because you're this size, if you dare gain one pound you're no longer beautiful,\" and telling her that she would be beautiful if she gained some weight is telling her, \"you're still not good enough, no matter how hard you try.\"\n\nFocus on compliments about her character, her style, her personality, things unrelated to her physical appearance. It's a slow process and you might get frustrated, but don't express that frustration to her and find someone else to vent to. She will likely already feel extremely guilty for worrying you and wasting your time with her \"trivial\" problems. If you express your frustration to her, she might lie and pretend she's better just to get you off her case. \n\nGood luck.",

Just let me hate myself and be honest about how I feel the one place I can? Reddit isn\u2019t a mirror of real life, I\u2019m just venting.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

I understand you\u2019ve been hurt, and it can be really hard not to pin the blame on demographics of people, especially when it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve seen that pattern of behavior from them (I know I sure as hell do this a lot), but that still doesn\u2019t justify it. \n\nYou can\u2019t claim to to say that you didn\u2019t intend to attack men who don\u2019t participate in these actions when that\u2019s not what you said in the post.  Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do.

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins.

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated. Let's open the door to conversation with asking each other why we believe what we claim to believe.",

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins. It isn't true, it's hurtful, and if you speak up you get attacked. \n\nI did make a larger post, and see where it goes. I am honestly not too hopeful.",

That is the problem. \n\nIf I said \"Women are *insert negative thing here* and never stipulate that this is really about a person I knew in my personal life, then that is a problem on my end. \n\nAnd your last paragraph illustrated my point completely. \n\n>I don\u2019t feel like a fucking adult and when men have treated me this way I feel even more childish.\n\nNo, you are a woman. 20 years old is adulthood. You are a woman, so don't infantize yourself. \"Men\" do not determine if you are a woman or a girl. \n\n It is a serious issue and it is something you will realise at 30 when men still call you (and treat) you like a \"girl.\" It's dismissive and disempowering. You are not a girl, you haven't been a girl for a while. You should own that! There should be no situation where you feel like you are a child, because you are not. You have a mental illness that is not childish nor should be dismissed. Remember that! Don't let anyone, your doctor, your parents, your friends, or your lovers, or anyone treat you like a child because *you are no longer a child.*",

I understand you\u2019ve been hurt, and it can be really hard not to pin the blame on demographics of people, especially when it wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve seen that pattern of behavior from them (I know I sure as hell do this a lot), but that still doesn\u2019t justify it. \n\nYou can\u2019t claim to to say that you didn\u2019t intend to attack men who don\u2019t participate in these actions when that\u2019s not what you said in the post.  Painting broad strokes about groups of people are only going to alienate more people from finding a community that could possibly help them.\n\nAnd no, being a rant doesn\u2019t justify it either. Put it in any other context and you can see why being in a state of emotional distress doesn\u2019t make discrimination of any kind okay.\n\nOnce again, I\u2019m sorry you feel the way you do. It sounds like you\u2019ve been put through some shit by some horrible people, but there\u2019s no reason to make people like me and the poster above take the brunt of your retaliation, especially considering this is forum for people going through similar problems.",

What I meant to say is that it's not a gender problem in that it sounded like quite a few people were pointing fingers at men, specifically. You were definitely right to feel alienated, and I agree with you that the tone of the thread was as well. I think the culture and society we are in have permeated the language of the people through exposure to mass media, etc. That is what I believe. And I think it is up to us, as you said, to bring change. I just think defensive hostility and accusations based off assumptions are out dated.

We feel that pressure to be perfect too, and it is so disheartening to see such blanket attacks against whole groups of people so regularly. \n\nBeing a gay man, I grew up in that environment. \"The gays love to prey on little children\" and then the dogpile begins.
