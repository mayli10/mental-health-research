Almost 3 years ago I had a really bad infection which affected my right kidney. It wasn't due to my ED, but during my last relapse I ended up restricting and overtraining massively and I could definitely feel the effects on my kidney. I had random shooting pains in my side, weird smelling pee... And your story scares me, because it could've happened to me too. I'm trying to recover, and things are going okay now, but you made me realize that I really need to get an ultrasound and see if I have further damaged my kidney with my behavior.\n\nI wish you well with your treatment, and hope that everything will work out smoothly.

I'm in recovery but I frequent this sub as I love this community. And I am so worried for most people here :( Bingeing, purging, restricting, fasting, laxative, diet pills, self-harm, self-hatred, suicidal ideation... everything. My best friend died from her eating disorder. I know multiple people who have died from theirs or having significant lasting health problems from it. I just... I don't know what to say sometimes, my heart just breaks reading some of these posts. I want to adopt everyone and give everyone a big hug.\n\nEdit: I don't care if you've never had physical health problems, either. Your struggles are still valid. My best friend was physically healthy when she died, but was mentally very, very unhealthy. She died by suicide. I read some posts on here discussing that and... yeah. I've almost killed myself multiple times because of my ED and I'm SO glad I never did. Because things got better. Then they got worse-ish again. Then they got better again. Happiness is a moment. A state. It's not a forever.  And neither is unhappiness.",
