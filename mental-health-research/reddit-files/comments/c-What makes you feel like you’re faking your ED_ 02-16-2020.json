That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**. For some reason back then I couldn\u2019t put together the reason I had more weekly calories to burn off to net under >!500!< was because of the damn exercise.\n\nAfter that I became afraid doing anything over a moderate amount of exercise with no rest day would make me voracious.",

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic.

Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough.

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**. For some reason back then I couldn\u2019t put together the reason I had more weekly calories to burn off to net under >!500!< was because of the damn exercise.\n\nAfter that I became afraid doing anything over a moderate amount of exercise with no rest day would make me voracious.",

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic.

All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough.

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**. For some reason back then I couldn\u2019t put together the reason I had more weekly calories to burn off to net under >!500!< was because of the damn exercise.\n\nAfter that I became afraid doing anything over a moderate amount of exercise with no rest day would make me voracious.",

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic. And truly a main reason I quit drinking was my weight being too high for my comfort. But I would say that I have been recovered since 2010 if you go by upward changes in BMI and calories consumed.",

I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

                        "Text": "I\u2019m the biggest lazy ass compared to my ED self at age 18 or 19  \n\n\nI used to wake up at 5:00 am so I could stretch, jump rope, lunge, squat, do push ups, lift a pair of five pound dumbbells, etc in a overnight fasted state. That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**. For some reason back then I couldn\u2019t put together the reason I had more weekly calories to burn off to net under >!500!< was because of the damn exercise.\n\nAfter that I became afraid doing anything over a moderate amount of exercise with no rest day would make me voracious.",

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic. And truly a main reason I quit drinking was my weight being too high for my comfort. But I would say that I have been recovered since 2010 if you go by upward changes in BMI and calories consumed.",

Like, \u201cI can eat 1200 calories\u201d on its own? Ok fine, but then \u201cI guess it\u2019s because I exercise so much haha\u201d tacked onto it. I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**.

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic. And truly a main reason I quit drinking was my weight being too high for my comfort. But I would say that I have been recovered since 2010 if you go by upward changes in BMI and calories consumed.",

I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of.

And people having a poor body image and being self conscious doesn\u2019t invalidate people with BDD.

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**.

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic. And truly a main reason I quit drinking was my weight being too high for my comfort. But I would say that I have been recovered since 2010 if you go by upward changes in BMI and calories consumed.",

Like, \u201cI can eat 1200 calories\u201d on its own? Ok fine, but then \u201cI guess it\u2019s because I exercise so much haha\u201d tacked onto it. I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**.

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic. And truly a main reason I quit drinking was my weight being too high for my comfort. But I would say that I have been recovered since 2010 if you go by upward changes in BMI and calories consumed.",

I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**.

Like, \u201cI can eat 1200 calories\u201d on its own? Ok fine, but then \u201cI guess it\u2019s because I exercise so much haha\u201d tacked onto it. I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*.

All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Practically live off hot chocolate\n\nI generally have more difficulty with binging than restricting but this is still true for me. Lots of people talk about how they would absolutely never drink calories but IMO a good calorific drink is more satisfying than the same calories in a lot of snacks and fills you up a more. It's hard to find a warm, satisfying snack under >!100cal!<, but a good cup of soy milk coffee or sugar-free hot chocolate or whatever else will satisfy me more and for longer, take me longer to consume, and generally tastes like a non-diet food for like... >!80!< or whatever calories.  \nAlso if I have a drink on the go or something then if I get an urge to boredom eat/binge, I see my drink and I'm like \"oh right I still haven't finished this yet\" and it usually distracts me until the desire to binge has passed.\n\nLike I can definitely see where people on the \"I would never drink calories\" end are coming from, because it's kind of like \"well why would I drink >!80!< calories when I can have a drink that's only >!5 or 0!< calories,\" but for me it's more like \"why would I eat >!80!< calories worth of food when >!80!< calories of drink is so much more,\" lol.",

Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*.

Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d.

Had it at my lowest BMI. Somehow had it on Lupron. Had it when I only ate carrots for 3 weeks.

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic.

The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d.

Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*.

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic.

Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of.

Realistically, everyone here has food issues of some sort, no matter where darts land on the DSM. But we all still doubt it for ourselves.\n\nKinda helps to see that everyone kicks themselves in the nads + questions reality in the same way. Used to think it was just me.",

Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**. For some reason back then I couldn\u2019t put together the reason I had more weekly calories to burn off to net under >!500!< was because of the damn exercise.\n\nAfter that I became afraid doing anything over a moderate amount of exercise with no rest day would make me voracious.",

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic.

The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

There's threads I avoid here because they're too triggering to me as an individual too.\n\nBeing triggered isn't an excuse to call vulnerable people virtue-signaling fakers or whatever this's supposed to be. Just because they seem obviously disordered to you doesn't mean *they* can see it.\n\nYou're being a dick to vulnerable people based on assumptions about their situations + reasons for posting.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of.

All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of.

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**. For some reason back then I couldn\u2019t put together the reason I had more weekly calories to burn off to net under >!500!< was because of the damn exercise.\n\nAfter that I became afraid doing anything over a moderate amount of exercise with no rest day would make me voracious.",

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic. And truly a main reason I quit drinking was my weight being too high for my comfort. But I would say that I have been recovered since 2010 if you go by upward changes in BMI and calories consumed.",

I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d.

I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of.

That was for 30-45 minutes and would be either moderate or high intensity. Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*. Moderate or high intensity or HIIT.\n\nThen I would walk home from the gym which took 10 to 15 minutes and involved going up a hill.\n\n\nAll of this was done regardless if it was one of the 3 days a week I had a Physical Education period for one of my college classes. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThese days I\u2019m pretty much exactly like you. \n\nThis definitely made me feel like one of my relapses was \u201cfake\u201d because that physiological dependency on exercise didn\u2019t come back, but I think the reason was after recovery I realized chronic intense exercise makes me **so fucking HUNGRY**. For some reason back then I couldn\u2019t put together the reason I had more weekly calories to burn off to net under >!500!< was because of the damn exercise.\n\nAfter that I became afraid doing anything over a moderate amount of exercise with no rest day would make me voracious.",

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic.

I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit.

All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough.

There are better ways to beg for validation than just adding \u201cBUT OTHERWISE I\u2019M DEFINITELY DISORDERED\u201d style qualifiers. Just say you eat more than what a stereotypical anorexic eats and go, don\u2019t add your \u201cbut I definitely exercise purge!!!\u201d type inserts. Believe it or not some of us fat weak-willed bitches won\u2019t even exercise our 1200 calories off!! And we\u2019re still sick (then again maybe we\u2019re not sick enough...)!!

Some folks on dieting forums do things some people here mentioned and you\u2019d be surprised how normalized even things like fasting can seem to others in fitness circles so it\u2019s hard to contextualize at times. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m giving people the benefit of the doubt, but at least in my case.

Geez maybe I never really recovered. lol. :/ I think I gained weight  because my alcohol problem and its alcohol calories superseded my eating disorder for a decade i.e. drunkorexic. And truly a main reason I quit drinking was my weight being too high for my comfort. But I would say that I have been recovered since 2010 if you go by upward changes in BMI and calories consumed.",

Then I\u2019d walk my dog and power walk in place while she was reliving herself.\n\nThen at some point after my work shift/last class i would go to the gym and work out for a cumulative 1 hour *minimum*.

I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit. (Hence why I made the sarcastic remark about \u201cI\u2019m okay with size zero BUT NOT SIZE TWO\u201d.) All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

There's threads I avoid here because they're too triggering to me as an individual too.\n\nBeing triggered isn't an excuse to call vulnerable people virtue-signaling fakers or whatever this's supposed to be.

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

For example, a fat person skipping meals or eating a tiny salad with no protein and minuscule nutrients would often be praised for being 'healthy'.\n\nThis is a subreddit where people with eating disorders come to vent and share the thoughts they bottle up all day, every day. Who do we help, exactly, if we started accusing each other of 'showing off for anorexic brownie points' when more likely somebody was simply searching for validation they they are indeed 'sick enough', and that their disorder should be taken seriously despite not precisely fitting the bill for what other people think an eating disorder should be?\n\nOf course people HERE don't think their symptoms aren't symptoms - but that's not what this is about. I hope I don't sound harsh. I'm aware this subreddit is filled with a lot of very sick people, myself included. I also think it shouldn't turn into a place for egging each other on with our unhealthy eating habits. But I don't think accusing people of being 'show-offs' about their potentially life-threatening disorders is helpful. I hope you understand.",

I can\u2019t think of a single purpose of that other than making those of us who can also eat that much but don\u2019t exercise it off feel like shit.

All of those little qualifiers is basically making sure that you absolutely can\u2019t doubt that the person who posted that point is somehow ill (as though any of us were here to doubt one another\u2019s illness?) but beyond that they all serve to make everyone else feel worse for Not Being Ill Enough, which basically counteracts... the original supposed intent of posts like this..? \n\nI\u2019m accusing people of wanting validation so bad that they\u2019re willing to trigger a lot of vulnerable folks into further risking their own health. Imagine if someone who\u2019s willing to eat 1200 calories a day but doesn\u2019t exercise-purge reads that OP. The message being received is that \u201cif this person, who exercises those excess calories off, feels like they\u2019re not sick enough, then I\u2019m clearly doing too little.\u201d\n\nIf these are your bottled up thoughts maybe think about why you bottle them up, before you open air them into an audience of extremely vulnerable people. Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

There's threads I avoid here because they're too triggering to me as an individual too.\n\nBeing triggered isn't an excuse to call vulnerable people virtue-signaling fakers or whatever this's supposed to be.

I'm sure you've met people who are aware they have \"disordered eating habits,\" but don't think that they have an eating disorder, even though they really clearly do. If you think that that's just them showing off their anorexic brownie points, that's on you, not on them. Shockingly, not everything that we do in relation to this mental illness is rational. I have my comment up there in that I thought it was normal to eat nothing but mandarin oranges for weeks before an event that I was afraid of. Looking back at it, I understand that it was compensating in advance because I have a restrictive eating disorder, but when I was really in the eating disorder? I thought it was proof that I was fine. We all come from different places and have different perspectives. \n\nIf this is a place for discussion, sometimes these are things that make sense to talk about. Sometimes discussions are triggering. Everyone's different, huh?",

Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Realistically, everyone here has food issues of some sort, no matter where darts land on the DSM.

Maybe it\u2019s the shame and the toxicity of your disorder. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of.

Like, I saw an honest to god \u201cI\u2019ve only been in inpatient once\u201d as though being there even the one time isn\u2019t 1) a privilege and 2) so stereotypical that it\u2019s definitely a disorder thing and 3) something a lot of us haven\u2019t done! This person\u2019s giving off the message that going to inpatient \u201conly once\u201d isn\u2019t good enough, and what does that say to everyone else? \n\n(And frankly, the desire for validation comes from a similar place as the desire to control our bodies. Like at one point a bunch of us decided that if we couldn\u2019t be thin we could at least get lots of strangers to tell us we\u2019re sick, and that\u2019s almost good enough. It\u2019s fundamentally a toxic thing to want. It\u2019s almost impossible to ever feel \u201cvalidated enough\u201d. But as my comment shows it\u2019s dirt goddamn easy to feel \u201cvery invalidated\u201d. I got invalidated by OP and made an angry post telling yall to harness it, before deciding to start exercise purging again when that was a behaviour that I\u2019d been struggling to get rid of. Apparently my comments are invalidating to like a million of you and I guess you\u2019ll... also do something that makes your health worse?)",

Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that you know if you said this stuff anywhere else you\u2019d make a lot of people (even non-ED people, just people who are very very immersed in the pervasive diet culture of our society) feel insecure, and you\u2019d risk them replicating you and hurting themselves just to keep up with a harmful standard that you established.",
