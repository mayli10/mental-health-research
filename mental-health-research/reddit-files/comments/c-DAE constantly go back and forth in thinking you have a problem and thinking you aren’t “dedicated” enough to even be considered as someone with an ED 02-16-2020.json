I\u2019m still overweight. No one is concerned, right. \n\nIt\u2019s such a bad cycle.

I know it's not serious enough what I have but I really struggle with my relationship towards food. I struggle so much being healthy like \"oh if I have this many calories, ill lose weight in this time\", I just always want everything right this moment or else I'll just give up and eat my life away.\n\nThen when I count calories my mind always tries to go, can I do less today? Even less the next day? Even less? Which eventually just triggers a binge which fucks up all of the made progress.\n\nIf I do manage to stick to a calorie goal, oh, went over by 20 or 100? I'm a failure and I may as well just indulge in everything.\n\nI've always dreamt over successful restricting but I know it's unhealthy and I know it's too hard for me to dedicate to. I already have several diseases with one of it being yet undiagnosed (I know there is something but they didn't bother at the hospital finding out what, as the most worrying symptom stopped). And with all of these conditions the ideal self-treatment is starting a Fodmap+low carb diet. I legitimately cannot imagine committing to something like that. The thought of giving up everything I enjoy depresses me.\n\nI have so much guilt over overeating (I know every time when I'm over indulging on a normal basis besides a horrible 'I want to eat everything right now'), yet I can't stop.\n\nNot to even mention what I see in the mirror and in photos of myself.",

Do you have anyone - friend, partner, family - who can sincerely answer if you tell the full truth and ask if they think you have an ED?\nIf not you ask a psychologist. I mean even if you weren't actually ed-sick, you clearly need psychological therapy... hell a lot of \"normal\" people do. But if you don't have in your life people that are informed and clear-minded about ED and mental illness, a therapist can definitely tell you and address you to the proper care.\n\nHere's my experience, if it might be of any help: My turning point was when I exagerated my behaviours so badly if was impossible not to notice, in a pathetical way. Probably I was incosciously trying to drive attention there, to make it evident so I could be convinced to go to recovery. Once when I was drunk I purged so hard I passed out and woke up with my face veins all bursted... impossible to hide with make up. Family sat me down and talked me into seeking a recovery center. I hope you don't have to touch the bottom that way but... what can I say it works.",
