                "Text": "Honestly, I think a big part of the reason EDs are so taboo is that \"normal\" people don't want to think too hard about their own habits.\n\nEven outside of the self righteousness of places like 1200, where you expect to see that kinda bs.\n\nFor instance. When me and a group of my classmates are offered cookies/cupcakes/whatever. Most of them say \"oh no, it'll make me fat.\" But then eat it anyway and say \"shit, I hate myself\". But when I just say, \"no thanks\", I get all kinds of reactions. From concern to unprovoked defensiveness. I refuse to buy that my behavior in that scenario is less healthy than theirs. Especially considering the fact that I'm at a healthier weight than most of them (I'm a hair underweight). But apparently I'm the only one with the problem.",

Post an OMAD that is 1000 calories + 250 for two glasses of wine, upvoted for 'keeping it real.' Or post a 300 calorie meal that has fake sugar/carbs/whatever-we-hate-today and get downvoted for not being healthy enough. Wtf.\n\n The gatekeeping and self righteousness is bullshit and what drove me to find ED support on here (MPA is a shit show except for the 30+ group).\n\nI got hella downvoted in fatlogic for saying a girl probably had an ED and the comment or was sure I was wrong because \"she was a healthy weight.\" I just can't even.

I can feel awesome eating 1000 calories of whole foods, but feel like garbage & be ravenous eating 1200 calories of poptarts & pizza (and often end up eating way more to kill the cravings).",

I understand how 1200 can work for some people but after a certain height or activity lifestyle it is impossible to meet your micro/macros, thus disordered eating. \n\n\nThis all sucks but at least with the new name and there is another ed sub up , I think everything will work out.\n\n",
