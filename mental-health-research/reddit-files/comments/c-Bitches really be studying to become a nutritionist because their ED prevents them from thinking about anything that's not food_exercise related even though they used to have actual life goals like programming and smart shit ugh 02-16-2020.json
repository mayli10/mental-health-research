                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you.

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you.

I think much of the misinformation mainly had to do with fads and trends, there's just so much that it's hard to think of specifics, especially given the culture we live in here in the U.S. I'd have to be here typing away all night. When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped.

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed.

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                            "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed.

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                            "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                            "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time.

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed.

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

I didn't even know there was medication for it after complaining about the same thing to several previous psychs but I believe her knowledge of EDs is probably the reason why she was able to identify what I was going through and wasn't hesitant to give me meds for it. Most docs I've talked to since don't even know there are meds for it. So in that case I appreciated having a doc who had knowledge of that. She wasn't an ED specialist, she was still in school and hadn't chosen a specialty yet aside from psychiatry. The only other way it affected our interactions (aside from that positive one) was that I sometimes worried that me talking about my disordered behaviors was triggering to her, but that wasn't because of her behavior, it was because of her appearance (what looked to me like she had an ED)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time.

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

I think much of the misinformation mainly had to do with fads and trends, there's just so much that it's hard to think of specifics, especially given the culture we live in here in the U.S. I'd have to be here typing away all night. When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped.

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

I think much of the misinformation mainly had to do with fads and trends, there's just so much that it's hard to think of specifics, especially given the culture we live in here in the U.S. I'd have to be here typing away all night. When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you.

I think much of the misinformation mainly had to do with fads and trends, there's just so much that it's hard to think of specifics, especially given the culture we live in here in the U.S. I'd have to be here typing away all night. When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you.

I think much of the misinformation mainly had to do with fads and trends, there's just so much that it's hard to think of specifics, especially given the culture we live in here in the U.S. I'd have to be here typing away all night. When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped.

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation.

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed.

When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously.

                        "Text": "Absolutely! In short, eating well (sensible amounts, and fairly healthy foods) is more important to us than most people think. We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped. It was simplified, and anyone can correct me or add anything if they want =)",

                        "Text": "Interesting question. Honestly, I had to switch off a certain part of my thought process to not allow her to become a trigger; I really liked her as a person (and *obviously* looked up to her), so I didn\u2019t want her own problems to get in the way of mine.\n\nThat said, I took her more seriously because her *advice* was better, not because of her. Luckily, our first meeting was via video call, so I never even saw her body at first, just face. She was really, really good with handling what I wanted and didn\u2019t want, and it made sense once I met her in person.\n\n(She was part of an inpatient program for dual diagnoses, so that\u2019s why I saw her in the first place.)\nI told her that I didn\u2019t need help with knowing what to eat, I just needed help with eating it. I was super clear that I was knowledgeable about food and nutrition; also, I told her that, if I were to put on weight, I\u2019d want to do it by becoming fitter and building muscle. I simply didn\u2019t want the patronization of, \u201cyou need food for your brain\u201d or someone telling me how many carbs I needed. You know the drill.\n\nI was surprised and happy that I actually *did* get something out of my sessions with her. And I know her having an ED was largely because of it: she *knew* what it was like, what our thought-processes looked like. She didn\u2019t lecture me about food and calories. The most she said is that I still need to put on *some* fat if I\u2019m going to put on muscle; and going over the whole serotonin being produced in your digestive system thing, which is always sooo important to remember, and honestly a good motivator, if nothing else.\n\nInstead, she gave me little tips and homework to do, such as [mirror exercises](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem). I had never heard of it, and I enjoyed the concept, because it was something feasible, something that didn\u2019t *actually* involve food. She tackled my issues from the mind up, not via prescribing a certain diet.\n\nFor anyone interested, she said:\nStand in front of the mirror, and look straight at yourself. Do this for at least about 15 mins a day. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to another person, say, your best friend. Tell them what you like about them, what makes you laugh, how beautiful they are, that they are good enough, that they deserve to eat etc etc. Anything you can think of, anything you\u2019d tell a best friend in the same situation. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, the act of seeing yourself while saying all these things is extremely powerful and, over time, those messages will really start sinking into your subconscious.\n\nShe said she got the idea from a book, I believe it might have been:\n[How To Heal Yourself when no one else can](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sxsrf=ACYBGNTaqn-1Gx9-bxmF27xGICyQnEKeoQ%3A1578696870882&ei=pgAZXuPDNfvA0PEP07Cy2A8&q=mirror+activity+self+esteem&oq=mirror+exercises+self&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.1.0.0i22i30l2j33i160l2j33i22i29i30.3941.4484..5285...0.1..0.101.470.4j1......0....1.........0i71j0.yIu1HadJsS4#sbfbu=1&pi=mirror%20activity%20self%20esteem).",

                        "Text": "One dietician was quite thin and had really bad brain fog. She would repeat the same stories over and over. The only thing she ever mentioned consuming was orange juice. She would hand-squeeze one orange at a time, not even close to filling a glass, but she insisted it was the right serving size to fill her up. I'm on a medication that (probably) makes some people gain weight, although there's not solid medical consensus on it yet. She directly said that the only people who gain weight on the medication were people who eat too much. I wasn't having issues with weight gain at the time, but it made me feel like if I ever started struggling, she wouldn't be a safe or helpful person to talk to.\n\nThen there was the ED therapist who hadn't recovered from binge eating. Or technically maybe she was \"clean\" but clearly hadn't done the emotional work. She was close to my age, not much more than five years older, so it was easier to build a rapport. We would have entire sessions where all we did was compare favorite and least favorite binge foods, talk about what's easiest/hardest to purge, and what tricks we discovered to help bring challenging foods back up. This lady would absolutely melt into her chair in pleasure, mouth slightly agape, at the mention of certain foods. Her biggest vice of all was cinnamon toast crunch. She was a kind person, but FUCK I can't believe I paid for sessions like that. \n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, I had a psychiatrist who totally didn't get EDs. He was a gym bro, really into fitness and nutrition. I don't think he had an ED or BDD, but he was so into the gym life and planning all his meals around workouts that he'd def developed some disordered habits. My favorite line: \"Have you ever considered treating food like fuel????\" Yes, you fucking asshat, yes, I have. Treating food like fuel is how I lost 50 lbs in 6 months, thanks. \n\nI've been dealing with a complicated, shape-shifting eating disorder for five years now, maybe seven years depending how you count. The only official diagnosis I've received is EDNOS (now OSFED) but at different times, I've been clinically diagnosable with a number of different disorders. Shit's really hard, y'all. Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.",

                            "Text": "\"Hard enough without having to sort through your doctor or therapist's own baggage.\" --- yup. Those are some crazy stories. My first dietician just didn't get me. She would ask things like \"don't you ever crave a hot meal?\" at a point where the rules were so rigid in my brain that I didn't know what \"Crave\" meant; I knew that I mono-ed on whatever thing my brain had decided. She might as well have been  talking to me in a foreign language. My doctor at the time was similar - I described liking cinnamon and she was like \"you should try Indian food, lots of spices.\" That particular phrase was my \"apple cinnamon pop tart\" phase. Indian food ?! They had no experience treating EDs and seemed unaware of Food Rules. On the upside of things I had a good therapist at the time. And I wasn't about to explain the Food Rules to the normies, didn't want to get locked in the hospital",

Then it's hard to do all the things to actually get an appointment and get all set up with a therapist. Then, when you're proud of yourself for making it happen and you've reached the promised land of therapy, it's just heartbreak and disappointment waiting for you. You see how flawed your mental health team is, how they're all just people and a lot of them don't even seem to be well informed. Then you wonder if maybe the kind of help you need doesn't even exist.\n\nI'm being overdramatic, obvs, but that's how discouraging it feels in the moment.",

I think much of the misinformation mainly had to do with fads and trends, there's just so much that it's hard to think of specifics, especially given the culture we live in here in the U.S. I'd have to be here typing away all night. When I was in high school, I would obsessively read everything on diet.com every single day. Most of the health info on the site is inaccurate or the facts are distorted to represent what the reader wants to hear. It's important to recognize the type of language and certain vocabulary used in false advertising in articles that may seem scientific at first glance. Strong knowledge of statistics and interpreting data, marketing, and the psychology of consumerism helps tremendously. I recommend quackwatch.com to people, although there's some information cited there that needs to be updated.",

We all know that serotonin is super-important for our mental health, since it\u2019s a neurotransmitter/hormone that helps makes us happy. Automatically, most people think it affects only the brain, and is produced in the brain. However, 90% of serotonin is actually produced in the digestive tract. When our gut is being damaged, or is otherwise unhealthy, it loses its ability to produce serotonin properly.\n\nMost of us here are depressed. Sure, we know that not eating well affects our mood. We just don\u2019t realise how *much* it affects our mood. If we don\u2019t eat right, we\u2019re literally not even giving ourselves a chance to be happy. Without a healthily functioning digestive tract, there is no way our brain can receive enough serotonin.\n\nI hope that helped.
