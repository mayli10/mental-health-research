                "Text": "Hey dude, just want to say that you're definitely not alone! It's honestly surprising how narrow the range of 'acceptable bodies' within the gay male community can be. I'm someone who's \"normal\" weight, non-white, and non-binary (male-bodied and don't care about being seen as male), and I honestly feel like the gay male scenes I've briefly interacted with can be super hostile if you don't fit in. Like I'd go as far to say that I've experienced more racism in that community than outside, which is kind of hilarious (on the flip side, also more homophobia in my culture than in America).\n\nIn no way do I want to invalidate what you're feeling because I 100% feel that too and is definitely the reason why I have such a shit relationship with food and eating, but if it makes you feel better even though I personally feel like I have to keep losing weight and become this ideal that I see in media, I 100% do not feel that way about others or people I find myself attracted to. Most of the people I've crushed on were totally independent of their weight and had so much more to do with their personality and how much I liked being around them. I'm not going to pretend like physicality has zero impact (it does for me and I think it's important to at least acknowledge it's a factor), but when I think about the people I like it has so so so much more to do with non-physical factors.\n\nAnyways this was kind of a long tangent but I really do hope this is at least a little bit helpful, just to have a perspective from another male-bodied person who's attracted to guys. One of my (not serious cuz he's straight RIP) crushes has actually gained weight since I first met him (he was the epitome of above-average height, twink body, and attractive in a nerdy way), and I still am just as (not seriously) attracted to him as I was before. Actually I'd say even more because I got to know him much better and really do love him for who he is, which does so much more for me than his body.",

I'm a gay trans guy, and even after HRT my weight distribution still goes right to my hips which are so damn wide people see them and think \"WOMAN!!!!\" even though I have no boobs anymore. (My hips look like they were drawn by Butch Hartman, it's the worst lmao)\n\nAnd (in my experience at least) a lot of guys who like guys, regardless of if they're cis or trans, don't like softer, more ~feminine~ bodies. So I've pretty much given up on trying to find a boyfriend until I lose enough weight to make my figure more androgynous.\n\nThere are plenty of guys who are still interested in me and the way my body looks now, but they're almost always cis guys who fetishize trans men, other trans guys who like being around me because I make them look way more masculine in comparison, or chubby chasers. And it's like... No fucking thank you lmao.\n\nI've dealt with that before and it just lead to me hating myself and my body even more. I'd rather avoid dating altogether until I lose the weight.",

                "Text": "Nope I get it I'm a lesbian and sometimes I feel if I were straight it would be easier to have a boyfriend all that though I highly doubt it. Like I won't let myself have a girlfriend till I'm at the stage of \"wait that girls a lesbian!\" Or the whole damn it I wish she was straight. Just cause in my head girls are picky and I like have to be perfect sort of things. Its messed up, like atm I really like this girl she lives s couple of hours away and I'm like not letting myself meet her until I'm at my goal weight",

Literally if I didn't have a big penis or wasn't attracted to old perverts I'd never get any, and in my current state there's no way in hell any guy my age would want me.",
