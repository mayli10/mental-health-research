I'll go there for some nice \"normal\" transformations or even just for an idea of how I might look at a certain weight but most of the posts are like obese/overweight to high normal. I even check for an inch above and below my height and there are rarely any posts even near the ballpark of what I want to see which isn't unreasonable considering it's still a \"healthy\" bmi. I feel awful for this but sometimes I'll actually end up saving the ED recovery progress pics bc both the before and the after are 99% of the time goals",

I'll go there for some nice \"normal\" transformations or even just for an idea of how I might look at a certain weight but most of the posts are like obese/overweight to high normal. I even check for an inch above and below my height and there are rarely any posts even near the ballpark of what I want to see which isn't unreasonable considering it's still a \"healthy\" bmi. I feel awful for this but sometimes I'll actually end up saving the ED recovery progress pics bc both the before and the after are 99% of the time goals",

I'll go there for some nice \"normal\" transformations or even just for an idea of how I might look at a certain weight but most of the posts are like obese/overweight to high normal. I even check for an inch above and below my height and there are rarely any posts even near the ballpark of what I want to see which isn't unreasonable considering it's still a \"healthy\" bmi. I feel awful for this but sometimes I'll actually end up saving the ED recovery progress pics bc both the before and the after are 99% of the time goals",

I'll go there for some nice \"normal\" transformations or even just for an idea of how I might look at a certain weight but most of the posts are like obese/overweight to high normal.
