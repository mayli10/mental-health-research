And also, sometimes invalidating. Because recognizing that I\u2019m being irrational and doing stupid, irrational things anyway makes it feel like a choice.\n\nBut in the moment, it never feels like a choice.\n\nMy therapist basically says that giving into my irrational thoughts is a bad coping skill to ease the anxiety. And that I have to not give in to the thoughts to train my brain to stop defaulting to bad skills. Easier said than done though.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if any of that made sense.
