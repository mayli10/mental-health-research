Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

It would have been received much better.\n\n\nAll of this is sort of pointless either way, because this is a complaint about guys *pretending these women aren't underweight,* and it was never a complaint about *whether* they found them attractive or not. \n\nYou missed the point, inserted a comment about your crotch, and put down skinny women all in one go.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Overweight is becoming more and more prevalent, so smaller women are special/novel/admired\n\n2. People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3. Positive feedback loop: tiny women are increasingly an object of desire, so they are spoken of and portrayed as special, making them more desirable, so they're portrayed that way even more, and so on",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

It would have been received much better.\n\n\nAll of this is sort of pointless either way, because this is a complaint about guys *pretending these women aren't underweight,* and it was never a complaint about *whether* they found them attractive or not. \n\nYou missed the point, inserted a comment about your crotch, and put down skinny women all in one go.",

Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it. I think being underweight basically is the only way to guarantee a small waist:hip ratio for a lot of women.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it. I think being underweight basically is the only way to guarantee a small waist:hip ratio for a lot of women.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

It drove them crazy to think that the world could go on without them, but not with only them.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13.

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

I even posted a pic of myself (*not pornographic*) with an alt account in some kind of feedback sub once because I was feeling self-conscious about being underweight and I got around 40 comments on that post and not a single one of them thought that there was anything wrong with me. I ended up deleting the pic less than a day later, but some of those comments were actually pretty gross and objectifying. It felt really good at the time, but also I knew in the back of my head that it really wasn't the kind of attention I should desire. It wasn't even a porn sub and I still had messages from guys asking me to post more explicit pics and one guy even said \"my jaw hit the floor so hard I broke it\". ^((Not sure if he meant the floor or his jaw broke.)) It's just kind of gross how men so often idolize underweight bodies. \n\nIn my case I am trans and according to the Tanner puberty charts I look like I have the body of a 13 year old which is something I feel really self-conscious about. So without my face in the pic it's kinda like those guys were inexplicably saying that being a normal-looking *adult* isn't ideal. Maybe that's off-topic though.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

It drove them crazy to think that the world could go on without them, but not with only them.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take.

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take.

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13.

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Overweight is becoming more and more prevalent, so smaller women are special/novel/admired\n\n2. People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3. Positive feedback loop: tiny women are increasingly an object of desire, so they are spoken of and portrayed as special, making them more desirable, so they're portrayed that way even more, and so on",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

(Sad, because I saw healthy pictures of her and she was a genuine knockout.)  \n\n\nI only really hung out with her one time, but we met for lunch and she basically wore her eating disorder on her sleeve. She ate barely-bites of food and covered everything with a thick layer of pepper (a known appetite suppressant). Girl clearly had some issues.   \n\n\nEventually, this creepy guy met up with us. He was nothing to look at, but his personality was the creepy part. She lied and said he was a work friend, but when he and I smoked a cigarette he said they didn't work together and were romantic. I expressed concern about her weight and asked what was going on there and he just flat-out denied that she was skinny.  I could've almost wrapped my little-ass hand around her calf and he \"didn't notice her being especially thin\".  \n\n\nConsidering her potential, this guy was hitting well above his average with her.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it.

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

It would have been received much better.\n\n\nAll of this is sort of pointless either way, because this is a complaint about guys *pretending these women aren't underweight,* and it was never a complaint about *whether* they found them attractive or not. \n\nYou missed the point, inserted a comment about your crotch, and put down skinny women all in one go.",

Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it. I think being underweight basically is the only way to guarantee a small waist:hip ratio for a lot of women.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

At least people who are into me can pretend it has nothing to do with that because I'm kind of on the tall side and my face makes me look like an adult. Usually people say I look 18-19. Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way. I mean, I don't always get carded when I buy alcohol, so obviously I don't look 16. I know I usually do, but it doesn't happen enough that I think I must look like an adult to other people.",

People work a lot more and in more sedentary jobs, so having the luxury of a very lean body is a form of social currency; it speaks of a measure of success\n\n3.

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it. I think being underweight basically is the only way to guarantee a small waist:hip ratio for a lot of women.",

Didn't have my face in the picture, so really just had my body. I'm 21 so of course the pics are legal, but I'm pretty sure I was probably not very healthy as a teen and likely messed up my puberty. I'm trans and was never very masculine and the last time I grew was at 13. Started my transition in college, but until recently I was underweight for a few years which definitely stunted growth caused by the hormones I take. It makes me feel that perhaps the things they liked about me were related to the fact that my body doesn't look like it belongs to an adult.",

It would have been received much better.\n\n\nAll of this is sort of pointless either way, because this is a complaint about guys *pretending these women aren't underweight,* and it was never a complaint about *whether* they found them attractive or not. \n\nYou missed the point, inserted a comment about your crotch, and put down skinny women all in one go.",

Youngest I got was 16, but that was from a family member who had never me, so she definitely wasn't sexualizing me and was probably just trying to be nice in her own way.

So if they gain weight, they\u2019re more likely to gain it in their upper bodies and have a larger waist/hip ratio. Of course, there are some exceptions, but white women having large butts and hips wasn\u2019t really a huge thing until plastic surgery began replicating it. I think being underweight basically is the only way to guarantee a small waist:hip ratio for a lot of women.",
