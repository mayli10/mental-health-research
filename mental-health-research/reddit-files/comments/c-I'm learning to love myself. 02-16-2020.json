I've been trying to take better care of my hair recently but all I've got is a sulfate-free shampoo bar and silicone-free conditioner. To be fair, just those two changes alone have totally changed my hair for the better haha",

My hair is full though, so instead of 15 min of hot water on my head, I stick to cooler temp. The day three years ago when I stopped applying heat and DIY hair dye was the day my hair came back to life haha\n\n\nAnd you\u2019re definitely making a good choice! A lot of those chemicals are present in \u201cdrugstore\u201d hair products because they\u2019re mass made. You never have to go broke, but spending one more minute and one more dollar for sulfate free works WONDERS.\n\nEDIT: look into homemade mixes too, things like apple cider vinegar, honey, you can make your own hair mask at home and it can do twice as much as just conditioner in a few minutes!",

                        "Text": "Ha ok! Well since I started about conditioner, I recommend cowashing, especially for those with kinky curly hair types. Basically, instead of shampooing every day (shampoo can have some harmful and drying chemicals), you condition, and only shampoo a couple times a week, after workouts especially. \n\nAlso, check for things like sulfate or alcohol type things in your shampoo. If you\u2019re wondering why you have oily roots, thin hair, split ends, a lot of the time shampoo is a big reason. Run it into your SCALP, and let it run down your hair when you rinse \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\n\nP. S. For those struggling with EDs and hair loss/growth, Mane N Tail has been mentioned a lot for getting more length. I know it\u2019s in places like Target or Walmart so not super expensive either. It\u2019s better for those with straight hair though.",
