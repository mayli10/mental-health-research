It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C.

And I'll check out mabgraves!",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

(It was a gorgeous summer day and my husband and I got married near the ocean in the morning.) As I was walking to the boat in my wedding dress, a lady told me that I was the most beautiful bride she had ever seen.  Then she took a picture of me.  I was quite thin at that time and that comment made me happy. :)",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

Our dinner discussions have steeled me to any and all things concerning the body lmao.\n\nI have crazy dry skin too! But I always thought it was either the elevated androgens or that I wasn't eating enough good fats or some vitamin? I have lizard face if I don't adhere to my skincare routine 100%.\n\nI wonder if the visanne contributes to the sex drive issue? When I was on hormonal bc I had NO sex drive and it sucked ass. Now I'm off it and horny af but can barely stop bleeding long enough to have sex so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nI get the apprehension about the surgery tho. It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take. Anytime I was on my period and had to go poo it was so painful (thanks to the colon fusion) I cried every time. Nothin more glamorous than crying while shitting.\n\nBut ibs symptoms too?

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I have all the fun ibs symptoms that go along with it, and I feel like it's starting to press into my bladder as I now have symptoms that suggest that.\n\nI'm on the visanne as a trial for 3 months, and I'm also on the wait list for surgery. He doesn't want to operate unless it's necessary since I'm young and he doesn't want me to continue to rack up more and more procedures. But it looks like I'm gunna do it. ",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

Nah, here's some hair and new places to store fat. I can't even imagine dealing with that on top of the endo. \ud83d\udc97\n\nI had my endo adhesions removed years ago (was born with em) but I know they will likely grow back. My uterus was fused to my colon and both ovaries were fused to something else I cannot remember. But, that laparoscopy was one of the best choices I made. I felt so much better!

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.

Yup.\n\nBut ApPAreNtLY you have to have 3 of the symptoms to qualify. So fuck me eh? Multiple procedures later (which did turn up endometriosis...but that's not the cause apparently?) and still nothing to 100% diagnose why I bleed for weeks at a time. I have one more procedure scheduled to try and find a cause, but wow I am fuckin DONE.\n\nSorry if I am over sharing or talkin too much...

My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C.

And I'll check out mabgraves!",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

It's just that I don't want to keep having them, since I know it doesn't fix everything. \n\nI also get flu symptoms for a few days when I'm ovulating. It sounds worse than it is, I'm doing ok but I think it's just cause I'm used to it and have a high pain tolerance.",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

She\u2019s a big proponent of #sickgirlsclub (maybe she started it?) and a great influence for people struggling with uterine issues.  It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.  Totally recommend checking out her posts if you\u2019re feeling alone in your experiences. ",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I just have literally zero sex drive (sorry if tmi) I do get nauseous sometimes, and I feel like it may be contributing to my pain but idk if it's this or my other medication. I'm also super gassy, and my skin goes through phases of being unbearably dry. \n\nI'm currently on visanne and I don't think it's helping at all, I feel like it's getting bigger. I have pain most days, but I have a high pain tolerance so it doesn't really make a difference to me. I have all the fun ibs symptoms that go along with it, and I feel like it's starting to press into my bladder as I now have symptoms that suggest that.\n\nI'm on the visanne as a trial for 3 months, and I'm also on the wait list for surgery. He doesn't want to operate unless it's necessary since I'm young and he doesn't want me to continue to rack up more and more procedures. But it looks like I'm gunna do it. ",

It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take.

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C.

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

(It was a gorgeous summer day and my husband and I got married near the ocean in the morning.) As I was walking to the boat in my wedding dress, a lady told me that I was the most beautiful bride she had ever seen.  Then she took a picture of me.  I was quite thin at that time and that comment made me happy. :)",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

Our dinner discussions have steeled me to any and all things concerning the body lmao.\n\nI have crazy dry skin too! But I always thought it was either the elevated androgens or that I wasn't eating enough good fats or some vitamin? I have lizard face if I don't adhere to my skincare routine 100%.\n\nI wonder if the visanne contributes to the sex drive issue? When I was on hormonal bc I had NO sex drive and it sucked ass. Now I'm off it and horny af but can barely stop bleeding long enough to have sex so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nI get the apprehension about the surgery tho. It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take. Anytime I was on my period and had to go poo it was so painful (thanks to the colon fusion) I cried every time. Nothin more glamorous than crying while shitting.\n\nBut ibs symptoms too?

It's just that I don't want to keep having them, since I know it doesn't fix everything. \n\nI also get flu symptoms for a few days when I'm ovulating.

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

Liiiike maybe you look teeny tiny but not in their particular definition at the moment- or they didn\u2019t want you to feel bad about yourself? There\u2019s a lot of thought that goes into a person\u2019s words, and sometimes there\u2019s an absence of thought, because something else is on their mind. It\u2019s why miscommunication and hurt feelings is so easy. They could literally mean anything, and your perception is yours and yours alone.

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

My doc is certain I have it, but says he cannot diagnose me because  one of the last qualifiers is ovary size. And welp, mine have cysts so he says he cannot measure them accurately with the cysts there.\n\nBut wonky ass periods? Yup.\nElevated DHEAS? Yup.\n\nBut ApPAreNtLY you have to have 3 of the symptoms to qualify. So fuck me eh? Multiple procedures later (which did turn up endometriosis...but that's not the cause apparently?) and still nothing to 100% diagnose why I bleed for weeks at a time. I have one more procedure scheduled to try and find a cause, but wow I am fuckin DONE.\n\nSorry if I am over sharing or talkin too much... I'm on day 22 of this period and I'm using reddit as distraction from today because today...fuckin sucks.\n\nEdit to add because I'm a selfish ho and I shoulda addressed this: I'm glad you're not prediabetic though!

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.  Totally recommend checking out her posts if you\u2019re feeling alone in your experiences. ",

I have lizard face if I don't adhere to my skincare routine 100%.\n\nI wonder if the visanne contributes to the sex drive issue? When I was on hormonal bc I had NO sex drive and it sucked ass.

It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take.

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

Fuck that.\n\nI'm sorry you got the short end of the stick with the pcos tho. Testosterone is a bitch. Like in dudes it can help them drop weight fast. But in ladies? Nah, here's some hair and new places to store fat. I can't even imagine dealing with that on top of the endo. \ud83d\udc97\n\nI had my endo adhesions removed years ago (was born with em) but I know they will likely grow back. My uterus was fused to my colon and both ovaries were fused to something else I cannot remember. But, that laparoscopy was one of the best choices I made. I felt so much better! Has your doc talked to you about surgery?",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Yup.\n\nBut ApPAreNtLY you have to have 3 of the symptoms to qualify. So fuck me eh? Multiple procedures later (which did turn up endometriosis...but that's not the cause apparently?) and still nothing to 100% diagnose why I bleed for weeks at a time. I have one more procedure scheduled to try and find a cause, but wow I am fuckin DONE.\n\nSorry if I am over sharing or talkin too much... I'm on day 22 of this period and I'm using reddit as distraction from today because today...fuckin sucks.\n\nEdit to add because I'm a selfish ho and I shoulda addressed this: I'm glad you're not prediabetic though!

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Instant panic mode. I thought I must look overweight like her (no offense, she is lovely) and I just hadn't realized it yet; also I was obviously slowly plunging my body into a disease. \n\nSpoiler alert: my insulin levels are fine.\n\nOr when my SO lovingly, carefully, told me one day as I was whining about not getting to eat something, \"Babe, you sound like an addict.\"\n\nI immediately thought \"Oh fuck, I must *look* like a food addict too.\". Yeah thanks brain.\n\nI hate not knowing what I look like to other people now. I'm constantly browsing the normalnudes sub and finding people with my stats and trying to come to terms what my body may actually be. But there are so many girls in the same range as me that look better! And then some that look bigger than I think I do?

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

                            "Text": "That really sucks.  Logically I understand a doctor has to recommend weight loss when someone is overweight, but mention it and move on!  Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C.

It's just that I don't want to keep having them, since I know it doesn't fix everything. \n\nI also get flu symptoms for a few days when I'm ovulating.

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

Now I'm off it and horny af but can barely stop bleeding long enough to have sex so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nI get the apprehension about the surgery tho. It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take. Anytime I was on my period and had to go poo it was so painful (thanks to the colon fusion) I cried every time. Nothin more glamorous than crying while shitting.\n\nBut ibs symptoms too? Fuck dude, you are a true and honest trooper. ",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

She\u2019s a big proponent of #sickgirlsclub (maybe she started it?) and a great influence for people struggling with uterine issues.  It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.  Totally recommend checking out her posts if you\u2019re feeling alone in your experiences. ",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

Fuck that.\n\nI'm sorry you got the short end of the stick with the pcos tho. Testosterone is a bitch. Like in dudes it can help them drop weight fast. But in ladies? Nah, here's some hair and new places to store fat. I can't even imagine dealing with that on top of the endo. \ud83d\udc97\n\nI had my endo adhesions removed years ago (was born with em) but I know they will likely grow back. My uterus was fused to my colon and both ovaries were fused to something else I cannot remember. But, that laparoscopy was one of the best choices I made. I felt so much better! Has your doc talked to you about surgery?",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

                "Text": "When I was a sophomore in high school, I auditioned and made it into the big choir (100+ singers) with all the upperclassmen. At the time I was also actively losing weight and vaguely in ED territory, exercising obsessively and just getting started with what would become years of restricting. I guess I had noticeably lost a little bit of weight, but it wasn't a huge amount; maybe 10-15 pounds max. No one except my best friend (or so I thought) noticed, and even then she barely mentioned it. And that was the way I wanted it. To me it was shameful that i was even chubby in the first place so the last thing I wanted was attention drawn to my body in any way. \n\nNow there was also an older girl in choir who I didn't know personally who had lost a TON of weight during the school year. She went from morbidly obese to just chubby; it must have been a loss of at least 70 lbs and she looked like a completely different person afterwards. The school newspaper even did a story on her \"weight loss journey\" and interviewed her for it; she was very open about the process and not ashamed as far as I knew.\n\nMost days in choir before we started practice our director would \"check in with the group\" and make any announcements he needed to; etc. The day of this incident, he was like \"Wow, did everyone see the amazing story about Becky (not her real name lol) in the newspaper? How inspiring! Congratulations Becky!\" And everyone clapped and cheered. THEN. He said: \"And I'd also like to congratulate m_inimal on her weight loss journey as well! Great job!\" \n\nEVERYONE in the choir turned and looked at me and I'm sure I immediately teared up in humiliation. This beautiful older girl who was tall thin and willowy and sat next me encouragingly whispered \"Great job\" even though I just wanted to die. A million negative thoughts ran through my head. Every guy who I had ever thought was cute in the choir would now think of me as fat. Every person who I wanted to just be invisible to (aka everyone) was now looking at me and thinking about my weight. Most of them were probably thinking \"Weight loss journey? She still looks chubby to me\" It was the MOST humiliating moment of high school without a doubt and it ABSOLUTELY kicked my ED into overdrive. I wasnt even angry at the director because I knew he meant well, and he was kind of weird anyway and sometimes missed social cues, plus he later apologized to me because he recognized I was embarrassed. I was FURIOUS with myself that my weight was so noticeable that even what I thought of as a minor fluctuation was enough to apparently earn me a fucking verbal medal. Also not gonna lie, it felt pretty bad to be mentioned in the same category as Becky, who admittedly had started off as pretty much a whale. \n\nBad memories yo lol",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.  Totally recommend checking out her posts if you\u2019re feeling alone in your experiences. ",

I have lizard face if I don't adhere to my skincare routine 100%.\n\nI wonder if the visanne contributes to the sex drive issue? When I was on hormonal bc I had NO sex drive and it sucked ass.

It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take.

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I'm also super gassy, and my skin goes through phases of being unbearably dry. \n\nI'm currently on visanne and I don't think it's helping at all, I feel like it's getting bigger. I have pain most days, but I have a high pain tolerance so it doesn't really make a difference to me. I have all the fun ibs symptoms that go along with it, and I feel like it's starting to press into my bladder as I now have symptoms that suggest that.\n\nI'm on the visanne as a trial for 3 months, and I'm also on the wait list for surgery. He doesn't want to operate unless it's necessary since I'm young and he doesn't want me to continue to rack up more and more procedures. But it looks like I'm gunna do it. ",

It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take.

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

(It was a gorgeous summer day and my husband and I got married near the ocean in the morning.) As I was walking to the boat in my wedding dress, a lady told me that I was the most beautiful bride she had ever seen.  Then she took a picture of me.  I was quite thin at that time and that comment made me happy. :)",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

It's just that I don't want to keep having them, since I know it doesn't fix everything. \n\nI also get flu symptoms for a few days when I'm ovulating.

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

She\u2019s a big proponent of #sickgirlsclub (maybe she started it?) and a great influence for people struggling with uterine issues.  It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.  Totally recommend checking out her posts if you\u2019re feeling alone in your experiences. ",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

Fuck that.\n\nI'm sorry you got the short end of the stick with the pcos tho. Testosterone is a bitch. Like in dudes it can help them drop weight fast. But in ladies? Nah, here's some hair and new places to store fat. I can't even imagine dealing with that on top of the endo. \ud83d\udc97\n\nI had my endo adhesions removed years ago (was born with em) but I know they will likely grow back. My uterus was fused to my colon and both ovaries were fused to something else I cannot remember. But, that laparoscopy was one of the best choices I made. I felt so much better! Has your doc talked to you about surgery?",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

As I was walking to the boat in my wedding dress, a lady told me that I was the most beautiful bride she had ever seen.  Then she took a picture of me.  I was quite thin at that time and that comment made me happy. :)",

                        "Text": "Yeah, doctors are fucking ridiculous like that. I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

It's just that I don't want to keep having them, since I know it doesn't fix everything. \n\nI also get flu symptoms for a few days when I'm ovulating. It sounds worse than it is, I'm doing ok but I think it's just cause I'm used to it and have a high pain tolerance.",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

She\u2019s a big proponent of #sickgirlsclub (maybe she started it?) and a great influence for people struggling with uterine issues.  It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.  Totally recommend checking out her posts if you\u2019re feeling alone in your experiences. ",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I have pain most days, but I have a high pain tolerance so it doesn't really make a difference to me. I have all the fun ibs symptoms that go along with it, and I feel like it's starting to press into my bladder as I now have symptoms that suggest that.\n\nI'm on the visanne as a trial for 3 months, and I'm also on the wait list for surgery. He doesn't want to operate unless it's necessary since I'm young and he doesn't want me to continue to rack up more and more procedures. But it looks like I'm gunna do it. ",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.

These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

                        "Text": "I had to look up colposcopy and died a little. I'm so sorry you had to do that!! That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words! And I'll check out mabgraves!",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

Do you know what I\u2019m talking about? And sometimes people say that to hurt you and sometimes they say it not to hurt you, but just because you weren\u2019t exactly what came to mind first. Liiiike maybe you look teeny tiny but not in their particular definition at the moment- or they didn\u2019t want you to feel bad about yourself? There\u2019s a lot of thought that goes into a person\u2019s words, and sometimes there\u2019s an absence of thought, because something else is on their mind. It\u2019s why miscommunication and hurt feelings is so easy. They could literally mean anything, and your perception is yours and yours alone.

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

He doesn't want to operate unless it's necessary since I'm young and he doesn't want me to continue to rack up more and more procedures. But it looks like I'm gunna do it. ",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I understand that that typically comes after girls begin their periods, so it may pass, but for the time being it certainly isn't helping. Your hair is also somewhat unattractive. That's the one area where it really helps to be effeminate. There are plenty of short cuts that are very cute, none of them look like a 7 year old boy's first haircut. Clothing is also very important, although admittedly not nearly as much on females as it is on males. It might help to have a better figure first, but in the meanwhile you really don't need a sweater to make you look even fatter.\u201d\n\nmy abuser said this to me (i would like to note i\u2019m transgender, female to male, which made this hurt all the more). it\u2019s what started my eating disorder.",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words! And I'll check out mabgraves!",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

But I always thought it was either the elevated androgens or that I wasn't eating enough good fats or some vitamin? I have lizard face if I don't adhere to my skincare routine 100%.\n\nI wonder if the visanne contributes to the sex drive issue? When I was on hormonal bc I had NO sex drive and it sucked ass. Now I'm off it and horny af but can barely stop bleeding long enough to have sex so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nI get the apprehension about the surgery tho. It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take. Anytime I was on my period and had to go poo it was so painful (thanks to the colon fusion) I cried every time. Nothin more glamorous than crying while shitting.\n\nBut ibs symptoms too?

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

I just have literally zero sex drive (sorry if tmi) I do get nauseous sometimes, and I feel like it may be contributing to my pain but idk if it's this or my other medication. I'm also super gassy, and my skin goes through phases of being unbearably dry. \n\nI'm currently on visanne and I don't think it's helping at all, I feel like it's getting bigger. I have pain most days, but I have a high pain tolerance so it doesn't really make a difference to me. I have all the fun ibs symptoms that go along with it, and I feel like it's starting to press into my bladder as I now have symptoms that suggest that.\n\nI'm on the visanne as a trial for 3 months, and I'm also on the wait list for surgery. He doesn't want to operate unless it's necessary since I'm young and he doesn't want me to continue to rack up more and more procedures. But it looks like I'm gunna do it. ",

It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take.

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

                            "Text": "That really sucks.  Logically I understand a doctor has to recommend weight loss when someone is overweight, but mention it and move on!  Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

When I was in Girl Guides (age 10ish?) we played this game where each girl lied on the floor with their heads on another girl's belly like a pillow. The girl on mine kept making comments like 'oh my pillow's SO BIG and SOFT and ROUND.' And I kind of wanted to die.\n2. In Grade 7 gym class, this boy looked down at my legs (I'm pear shaped and definitely bigger on the bottom), and said in this super surprised and disgusted tone, \"Oh my god, you're FAT!\" And then kept making similar comments the rest of the year. I remember one time I was sitting on a desk, and the leg actually gave way and I fell down, so that was nice fuel for the fire too.\n3. I went shopping for a swimsuit with my mom when I was maybe 14. She was immediately like, \"what are you, a large?' and when I paused like wtf \"oh...and extra large?\" (I got a small top, and a medium bottom btw)",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

She\u2019s a big proponent of #sickgirlsclub (maybe she started it?) and a great influence for people struggling with uterine issues.  It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.  Totally recommend checking out her posts if you\u2019re feeling alone in your experiences. ",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Yup.\n\nBut ApPAreNtLY you have to have 3 of the symptoms to qualify. So fuck me eh? Multiple procedures later (which did turn up endometriosis...but that's not the cause apparently?) and still nothing to 100% diagnose why I bleed for weeks at a time. I have one more procedure scheduled to try and find a cause, but wow I am fuckin DONE.\n\nSorry if I am over sharing or talkin too much... I'm on day 22 of this period and I'm using reddit as distraction from today because today...fuckin sucks.\n\nEdit to add because I'm a selfish ho and I shoulda addressed this: I'm glad you're not prediabetic though!

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C.

                "Text": "Idk what it is but every time we get some bogus staff T-shirt for work, someone hands me a medium. It\u2019s freaks me. The fuck. Out. Meanwhile I swap it out for a small and it\u2019s roomy on me. Doesn\u2019t matter. Someone *thought* I was a medium. \n\nAlready made this comment above but anytime anyone ever says anything about the amount of food I have in front of me, I never want to eat again. \n\nI was in 5th grade and going back to school shopping with my mom. Puberty hit me like a ton of bricks, so I was a bit hippy for my age. I have no idea why, but she kept handing me pants that were way too small, insisting I try them on, and then getting *mad at me* when they didn\u2019t fit. After enough of this I started crying and asked for a hug. She walked away. \n\nAfter admitting to a therapist that I had an ED, knew I should recover but low key didn\u2019t want to, she proceeded to tell me in our next session that I looked thinner. I have no idea why she thought it was a good idea to say that; either I would have been upset that my attempt at recovery was shitty, or feel reinforced by the comment and continue to restrict (which is what happened). She also recommended that I *go to the gym* to relieve my anxiety.  ",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

                "Text": "When I was 16 my parents both joked about how I should \"be sick all the time\" because of how much I ate. So I started purging to condition my body into associating food with illness. Now I'm 27 and I have to hold myself back from purging every time I eat because I succeeded and now eating anything makes me nauseous. :)\n\nWhen I was 20 I lost 10 pounds in 2 days because I got extremely sick with the flu and couldn't eat. Then a month later my mom asked about what I did to lose weight, and when I reminded her that it was because I was so sick I couldn't eat. And then she just shrugged and said \"well it did wonders for your figure\"\n\nAnd 2 years ago my doctor whose idea of care was \"lose weight\" no matter what issue I came in for, saw I had gained 2 pounds since our last check-up and when I (truthfully) told him that I was trying my hardest to lose weight in a healthy way by exercising every day and eating under 1200 calories, his response was to tell me this: \"It doesn't matter if you're trying because you're obviously not trying hard enough. You had better lose some weight the next time I see you, I don't care how you do it.\" So I started exercising even more, ate only 300 - 500 calories, started abusing laxatives again, and relapsed with purging everything I ate. Then when I went to see my doctor again, he told me I looked so much better and probably felt better too lmfao. (I didn't, because I was seeing him about my pain and it turns out I have fibromyalgia, which doesn't suddenly disappear after a doctor mandated eating disorder rofl.)",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

(It was a gorgeous summer day and my husband and I got married near the ocean in the morning.) As I was walking to the boat in my wedding dress, a lady told me that I was the most beautiful bride she had ever seen.  Then she took a picture of me.  I was quite thin at that time and that comment made me happy. :)",

It's just that I don't want to keep having them, since I know it doesn't fix everything. \n\nI also get flu symptoms for a few days when I'm ovulating. It sounds worse than it is, I'm doing ok but I think it's just cause I'm used to it and have a high pain tolerance.",

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.

I have lizard face if I don't adhere to my skincare routine 100%.\n\nI wonder if the visanne contributes to the sex drive issue? When I was on hormonal bc I had NO sex drive and it sucked ass.

It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take. Anytime I was on my period and had to go poo it was so painful (thanks to the colon fusion) I cried every time. Nothin more glamorous than crying while shitting.\n\nBut ibs symptoms too?

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I'm lucky I have high pain tolerance, but even then it still knocks me out some days. \n\nI'm on metformin for the pcos, I have no idea if it's doing anything but the side effects suck lol. ",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

There\u2019s a lot of thought that goes into a person\u2019s words, and sometimes there\u2019s an absence of thought, because something else is on their mind. It\u2019s why miscommunication and hurt feelings is so easy. They could literally mean anything, and your perception is yours and yours alone. I\u2019m rambling, but I think you understand \ud83d\ude05",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It\u2019s something that drastically impacted her life, but she still writes about her focus on her family/art and the positive impact that has on her.

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

My doc is certain I have it, but says he cannot diagnose me because  one of the last qualifiers is ovary size. And welp, mine have cysts so he says he cannot measure them accurately with the cysts there.\n\nBut wonky ass periods? Yup.\nElevated DHEAS? Yup.\n\nBut ApPAreNtLY you have to have 3 of the symptoms to qualify. So fuck me eh? Multiple procedures later (which did turn up endometriosis...but that's not the cause apparently?) and still nothing to 100% diagnose why I bleed for weeks at a time. I have one more procedure scheduled to try and find a cause, but wow I am fuckin DONE.\n\nSorry if I am over sharing or talkin too much... I'm on day 22 of this period and I'm using reddit as distraction from today because today...fuckin sucks.\n\nEdit to add because I'm a selfish ho and I shoulda addressed this: I'm glad you're not prediabetic though!

It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

                        "Text": "I had to look up colposcopy and died a little. I'm so sorry you had to do that!! That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words! And I'll check out mabgraves!",

All of these procedures that require poking, prodding, scraping, and cutting should require anesthesia.  If the topic ever comes up among family or friends about uterine/pregnancy health (which is admittedly rare) I spill the beans about everything I\u2019ve gone through.  Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.  Best of luck for your uterus to be healthy (or at least not in pain) for a long time!",

(It was a gorgeous summer day and my husband and I got married near the ocean in the morning.) As I was walking to the boat in my wedding dress, a lady told me that I was the most beautiful bride she had ever seen.  Then she took a picture of me.  I was quite thin at that time and that comment made me happy. :)",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Like insomnia and muscle problems need to be treated on their own, it doesn\u2019t matter what else is going on if those problems aren\u2019t caused by weight.  \n\nI have a friend who weighs about 220-240 pounds who had the same complaints as you with her doctor, finally found out *in her 50s* that she has multiple sclerosis which is why it was so painful for her to move and to even try to lose weight.  It\u2019s infuriating that so many doctors seem to know less than their patients and certainly don\u2019t have decent bedside manner.  I hope your new doctor is treating you much better.",

But I always thought it was either the elevated androgens or that I wasn't eating enough good fats or some vitamin? I have lizard face if I don't adhere to my skincare routine 100%.\n\nI wonder if the visanne contributes to the sex drive issue? When I was on hormonal bc I had NO sex drive and it sucked ass. Now I'm off it and horny af but can barely stop bleeding long enough to have sex so \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nI get the apprehension about the surgery tho. It can create scar tissue which can lead to possible fertility issues. However, that was a gamble I was willing to take. Anytime I was on my period and had to go poo it was so painful (thanks to the colon fusion) I cried every time. Nothin more glamorous than crying while shitting.\n\nBut ibs symptoms too?

It's just that I don't want to keep having them, since I know it doesn't fix everything. \n\nI also get flu symptoms for a few days when I'm ovulating.

That sounds painful as fuck.\n\nI've had a sonohysterography (sp?) where they dialated my cervix and filled the ol baby maker with saline. 10/10 would never do again. It was so painful and they didn't find what is causing the bleeding anyway. My doc then suggested we do a uterine biopsy in the office or go thru with they hysteroscopy and do it in conjunction with the scope and a D&C. I chose the latter because if the offic biopsy found nothing then I'd need the hysteroscopy anyway...and I'd rather be asleep thru the pain. \n\nIt's always so surprising to me how common uterine issues are, but no one ever talks about them. \n\nBut thank you for the kind words!

Like you said, it\u2019s so helpful knowing that people have gone through what you\u2019ve gone through and that it\u2019s not something strange.  When I was infertile for years it was amazing how many acquaintances told me in private that they struggled for years themselves.

It doesn't necessarily mean type 2 when people talk about diabetes. Also excessive thirst can funnily enough be a symptom of hyperthyroidism (which also causes drastic weight loss haha).",

I am fat (highest weight was 250 lbs, currently 201), but he'd insist on weight loss being the solution no matter what the problem was. Ear infection? Lose some weight. You're dealing with panic attacks and suicidal thoughts? Lose some weight. Insomnia due to muscle pain? Lose some weight. Sprained your ankle? Maybe you should lose some weight! These are all examples of problems I had come in with, and the solution was always \"lose some weight\" instead of doing his goddamn job and finding a proper solution to what was wrong.\n\nHell, even when there were signs of me being healthy even at my highest weight (blood pressure is good, lower blood cholesterol, no signs of being pre-diabetic or anything like that), he'd insist that the results must be wrong because apparently my size and the results couldn't possibly be right! He also tried to discourage me from transitioning (I'm a trans guy) by saying testosterone will make me gain weight (I've lost over 20 pounds since starting t so lmao) and being an obese man instead of an obese woman \"isn't any better\".\n\nI literally had to argue with him to get a referral to a rheumatologist, because losing weight hadn't stopped my daily pain but he kept insisting that it would just go away if I was skinnier. And then after getting him to give me that referral, the rheumatologist who saw me diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.\n\nLike, dude. Just fucking say you hate fat people and find something else to do with your life. You're a doctor, you're supposed to give people the care and knowledge they need. Not insist every problem can be solved with weight loss and encourage eating disorders in your patients when they aren't losing weight fast enough for your liking.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't see him anymore lmfao",

Yup.\n\nBut ApPAreNtLY you have to have 3 of the symptoms to qualify. So fuck me eh? Multiple procedures later (which did turn up endometriosis...but that's not the cause apparently?) and still nothing to 100% diagnose why I bleed for weeks at a time. I have one more procedure scheduled to try and find a cause, but wow I am fuckin DONE.\n\nSorry if I am over sharing or talkin too much... I'm on day 22 of this period and I'm using reddit as distraction from today because today...fuckin sucks.\n\nEdit to add because I'm a selfish ho and I shoulda addressed this: I'm glad you're not prediabetic though! That's a relief eh?",
