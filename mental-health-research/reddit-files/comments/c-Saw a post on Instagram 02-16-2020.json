Are there models who are fit and healthy and not malnourished, etc.? Sure. But I just don\u2019t think an eating disorder sub, where many people on here probably will interpret what you\u2019re saying in a disordered way, is the appropriate place to talk about how Victoria\u2019s Secret models can be a good source of inspiration to look up to.",

Are there models who are fit and healthy and not malnourished, etc.? Sure. But I just don\u2019t think an eating disorder sub, where many people on here probably will interpret what you\u2019re saying in a disordered way, is the appropriate place to talk about how Victoria\u2019s Secret models can be a good source of inspiration to look up to.",

Are there models who are fit and healthy and not malnourished, etc.? Sure. But I just don\u2019t think an eating disorder sub, where many people on here probably will interpret what you\u2019re saying in a disordered way, is the appropriate place to talk about how Victoria\u2019s Secret models can be a good source of inspiration to look up to.",

Are there models who are fit and healthy and not malnourished, etc.? Sure. But I just don\u2019t think an eating disorder sub, where many people on here probably will interpret what you\u2019re saying in a disordered way, is the appropriate place to talk about how Victoria\u2019s Secret models can be a good source of inspiration to look up to.",

Are there models who are fit and healthy and not malnourished, etc.? Sure. But I just don\u2019t think an eating disorder sub, where many people on here probably will interpret what you\u2019re saying in a disordered way, is the appropriate place to talk about how Victoria\u2019s Secret models can be a good source of inspiration to look up to.",

It\u2019s a very well documented issue how the modeling industry correlates with eating disorders, and how many models suffer with an eating disorder and/or are underweight. Are there models who are fit and healthy and not malnourished, etc.? Sure. But I just don\u2019t think an eating disorder sub, where many people on here probably will interpret what you\u2019re saying in a disordered way, is the appropriate place to talk about how Victoria\u2019s Secret models can be a good source of inspiration to look up to.",

I have a bunch of extra breast tissue from nursing for years that would not exist without kids, and I\u2019ll need to have surgery to get rid of it. There are also women who have a lot of excess skin/tissue on the tummy from being pregnant and if it doesn\u2019t \u201csnap back\u201d they need surgery to get into their pre-pregnancy size pants.
