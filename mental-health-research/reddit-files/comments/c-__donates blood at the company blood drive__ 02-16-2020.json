If your\u00a0tattoo\u00a0was applied in one of the 11 states that\u00a0do\u00a0not regulate\u00a0tattoo\u00a0facilities,\u00a0you\u00a0must\u00a0wait\u00a012 months before\u00a0donating blood. This requirement is related to concerns about hepatitis. Currently, the only states that DO NOT regulate tattoo facilities are Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming, as well as the District of Columbia.\u00a0\n\nSo if you live anywhere else you can donate regardless because tattoo shops are state regulated.",
