Because that makes sense, right?\n\nNowadays, I do not care. I will ask for two boxes of Bronkaid while buying a full ECA stack. Because I've realized in all my experience, the pharmacist just wants to make a sale. The fact that they have to scan your ID is an inconvenience for them as much as it is for you.\n\nIn your case, I'm guessing either that particupar Krorger was legitimately out of stock, or maybe they didn't sell it at all.",

It\u2019s a big grocery store and there was a freaking coupon for it, so it seems unlikely they didn\u2019t have it, and that she\u2019d give me this look of dismissal about it.
