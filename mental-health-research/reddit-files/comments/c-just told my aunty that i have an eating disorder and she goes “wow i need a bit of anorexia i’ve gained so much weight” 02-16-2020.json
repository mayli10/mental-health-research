They don\u2019t know that they can be debilitating and take ages to work through (and some people never do). Some people think EDs are choices (even some people with EDs). In such cases I turn my irritation into a teachable moment to educate someone about eating disorders and mental health in general. \n\nWhen it\u2019s someone who should know better I rage though. 100%\n\nYou\u2019re so strong for telling your aunt!
