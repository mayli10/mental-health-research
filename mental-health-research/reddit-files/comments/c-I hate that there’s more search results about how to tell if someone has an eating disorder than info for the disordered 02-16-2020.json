I'm so tired of the *butterfly and flowers* imagery that surrounds eating disorders, I really want media outlets and hollywood to stop romanticizing this bullshit. \n\nWe want to know how to heal and we want (maybe?) our loved ones and our support net to have the right weapons to help us, and telling them \"uuuh your friend is skinnyy bye bye she dying\" it's not the right weapon. We still look like human beings, and we (at least I do) want to be treated like humans, I want to know I'm going to heal, not how much time I have left until they put me into a mental hospital, according to a random online doctor.",

And even those that do may need support during the other 6 days/week they\u2019re not in therapy. But beyond some of the bigger ED support sites, it\u2019s hard to find quality resources.",
