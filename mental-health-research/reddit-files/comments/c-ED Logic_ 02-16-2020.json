I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",

I think for me it\u2019s usually like, \u201ci don\u2019t want to eat a full 300 calories so I\u2019ll just eat this 100 calorie bag of popcorn.. well I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have 3 Hershey\u2019s kisses, ugh I\u2019m still hungry so I\u2019ll have this small snack...\u201d next thing I know I\u2019m at like 400 calories and would have been more full if I just ate the 300 calorie meal in the first place. Then it\u2019s too late to go back. If I eat the 300 cal meal now when I\u2019ve already eaten 400 cal of bs I\u2019ll be at 700. Then I eat enough snacks I\u2019m at 700 anyway\n\nThe linguine with spinach ricotta meatless meatballs is 260 calories and is amazing. I actually love meat but those meatballs are so good\n\n260 is about the highest I\u2019ll go for a frozen meal, unless I\u2019m going to eat it as dinner I\u2019ll go a bit higher \n\nSmart ones brand Santa Fe rice and beans is 260\n\nSmart ones angel hair with marinara is 200 and my most recent favorite \n\nMain Street kitchen fettuccine with broccoli is 220 and only like $0.96 at Walmart",
