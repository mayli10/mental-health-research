Like I had a panic attack in the grocery store and the person I was shopping with (who like has *been there the whole time* that I've been struggling, like is intimately familiar with the fact I have an ED) was like \"what? What's the matter with you? Why are you freaking out?\" \n\nLike, buddy, come on. You know why. Why do I have to keep *reminding* you? \n\nAnd the fact that they forget just translates to \"it's because I look fat, they don't believe I have an ED\" even though I'm teetering on the edge of an 18 bmi.

I had a good mental breakdown for the entirety of last week and binge ate that whole time because I just felt insatiable and unable to stop thinking about eating. I was never underweight, and only on the cusp/underweight on some days if I actually had a decent bowel movement lmao. I think I'm making a huge amount of progress on my own, but I feel like an entirely different person and it has been hard to deal with. Who am I really without my ED... :/ does anyone who has recovered have any tips? I have no idea if I'm doing anything \"right.\"",
