But he was certainly full of himself so I guess it all falls into place. \n\nSimilarly to you I got drunk with this guy one time after knowing him a few months, and then cried about how fat and ugly I was and how I used to be skinny and beautiful and now I was fat and worthless. And how I basically wasted my life puking and overdosing on laxatives and I wanted to die and shit like that. He basically said \u201cyou\u2019re skinny tho and don\u2019t do that stuff\u201d and never spoke about it again and ghosted a month later so... twins kinda?\n\nI\u2019m sorry that happened to you tho.

I understand EDs are a hard thing to cope with and I can respect that not everyones gonna be down to handle that. I had an ex tell me when he broke up with me that the whole reason he couldn't be with me was that no matter how much he told me I was attractive or thin or whatever, I dismissed it and he just got tired of it.

It was uni time and I was drunk and high and going clubbing and everybody was pissed off with me for making everybody late cause i was too busy sniffing speed and coke because i was so embarrassed (I'm not a club person, I hated my weight and think I am repulsive too), I was kinda hoping they'd go without me. In the end they kinda did. On the way there I stopped a fight between two guys and let the one guy run off and calmed down the other and his girlfriend. Then I met this other guy near a club. He was super hot, I was super high. After nearly getting myself into another fight, this time involving knives, the guy pulled me back and then eventually the two gangs dissipated and nothing bad happened. So he was kinda my knight in shining armour too. I asked him to come to the other club and met my friends and some other people. Then on the way back to our flats me and this guy kissed, a lot. Eventually my friends had to pry us off eachother to get back to the flats but it was amazing cause I never did stuff like that, especially kiss random hot guys who think I'm also hot. But when we all got back to my room (i think maybe he was expecting to be the only one), we spoke and I told him how ugly I thought I was and fat and how I had to get high to get confident and how this never normally happens and how could he be interested in me basically everything you described and later on he left, after kissing me again, gave me his number. Texted me a couple times the next day, and basically never spoke to me again. So yeah. Fun times. \n\nBut just learn from it and realise you're obviously not ugly and believe that you can find someone, don't give up just cause some people are dickheads. Just keep being a nice person and if you're losing weight do it for you, and trust the person who comes along, the right person, will love you for your personality cause right now I'm with a guy, it's a trial relationship but I hate myself and he knows I do but he still likes me and doesn't care about my weight or how I feel about myself, he wants to help and make me happy. Just keep the faith. ",

Start with whenever you think something negative about yourself, you also have to come up with two positive things about yourself, even if it feels fake or like a reach at first. I was listening to a psychology podcast the other day, and it was about relationships but it applies to your relationship with yourself too. They said it takes hearing something positive four times to sink in the same as one negative thing. The negative thoughts may always be there to a degree (they are for me, I\u2019m on a treadmill as I write this sooo) but you can work to balance them out more. Just fake it til ya make it, tell yourself you\u2019re someone who loves themselves and follow it up with at least a few winning qualities about yourself. Also if you were once obese and you aren\u2019t anymore, odds are you\u2019re a supremely tough and dedicated person who can tackle this too. Ps get a therapist, they\u2019re super helpful.",
