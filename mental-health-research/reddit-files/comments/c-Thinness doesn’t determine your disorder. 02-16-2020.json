                "Text": "your eggo story hits home, fuck. my mum used to buy multipacks of crisps for me and my sibling to take to school or have a packet after dinner. i'd turn on the tap and open two packets, put the contents of one into the other and hide the empty packet in the bottom of the bin. i thought i was so sly lol, no one will ever know i'm having 2 in 1 !! \n\ni have never been on the low low end of the bmi scale but lord knows i've suffered enough for my ed, i'm so done with the idea that once your bmi hits 18.49 you get the biggest trophy or the biggest award for 'crossing a finish line'. it's bullshit. and the tumblr-esque approach to having an ed and feeling almost proud of being so tiny is very very toxic and i see that attitude seeping through into this sub sometimes. and i totally understand that we are all victims of disordered habits and therefore it'll have a direct effect on the way we all think and rationalise things - but when there's comments egging on anorectic behaviours because 'you haven't yet hit an underweight bmi', it becomes unhealthy for not only the OP but for anyone who reads that and is totally invalidated by a random, uninformed comment. \n\nyour struggle is not defined by your weight. anyone who struggles with binging and restricting will know this all too well - your eating habits can go from 0 to 100 and the scale is at a standstill. i wish you all the best, OP, and thank you for this post i really needed to read it today. \ud83d\udc95",

                "Text": "honestly op, thank you for posting this bc youre so right! i wish people wouldnt act as if hitting a very low weight is the only thing that makes an ed dangerous. the mindset, the lack of important nutrients and vitamins, the extremes we can go to are dangerous things too. ive never been underweight, but ive still fainted at the gym, ive struggled with laxative abuse and even straight up misused prescription drugs all in the name of my ed, and plenty of other shit that messes with my body and my mind. if someone is suffering they deserve support, it doesnt matter if their bmi says theyre underweight or overweight or anything in between. we all struggle.
