It's bullshit because the main character is ALWAYS just as skinny and pretty as the bitchy girls who don't eat bread. Everyone thinks dieting is stuck up and overeating is fun and makes you unique but what the fuck is so special about eating? Literally everyone loves food. Even skinny girls, a lot of them just choose moderation and that's not stuck up.",

It\u2019s not realistic and it\u2019s not what they\u2019re doing.

Also, for many of them, this is their job so they are exercising constantly to look good (and TONS of photoshop cuz they ain\u2019t really that \u2018curvy \u2018 and skinny).\n\nIt\u2019s like me vs my boyfriend. I can eat maybe 1200-1500 a day and maintain (I think?) whereas he can eat over 3000 and maintain. He just works out and is active so much that he can eat way more than me. Those models are probably the same, since they\u2019re paid to be pretty, their job is literally to go to the gym.",
