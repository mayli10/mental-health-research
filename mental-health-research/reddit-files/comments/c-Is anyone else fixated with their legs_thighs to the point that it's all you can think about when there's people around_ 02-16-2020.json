It's where I store most of my fat, so I already have a thick ass waistline, plus I bloat very very badly :( it's hard to feel cute when my whole abdomen looks kinda repulsive. I don't gain as much weight in my limbs, which is nice on it's own but it makes my abdomen look larger in comparison.\n\nI absolutely don't say this to detract from the pain anyone feels about their legs, but I almost have a little envy for those who consider that their problem area! I feel like thick thighs are viewed more positively than beer bellies lol. Grass is always greener I guess.",
