I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",

I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",

I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",

I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",

I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",

I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",

I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",

I auditioned and got into an elite women\u2019s a capella group at my school (only 8 spots total, so it was extremely competitive lol) and so there\u2019s a big deal made out of becoming part of the group. Part of the initiation is the previous members coming to your house super early in the morning and kidnapping you (they wear masks and you\u2019re blindfolded and handcuffed/tied up lmao) and then putting you in the back of a car with the others. Your parents are warned ahead of time lol, so it\u2019s not as weird as it sounds, it\u2019s all in good fun. \n\nWe were on the road and obviously we are still blindfolded in the trunk area and I suddenly smelled donuts. So I go \u201cDid we just pass -name of neighborhood donut shop-??\u201d And they were baffled that I somehow knew where we were despite being tied and blindfolded in a trunk. One of them was like \u201cput your blindfold back on!!!\u201d They were surprised to find I was still totally blind. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nGood times.",
