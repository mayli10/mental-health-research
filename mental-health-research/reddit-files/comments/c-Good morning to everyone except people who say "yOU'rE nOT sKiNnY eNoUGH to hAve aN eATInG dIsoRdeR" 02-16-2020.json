Yeah right. She ended up leaving. No one liked her anyway. I\u2019m still sad she didn\u2019t give recovery some time, no one deserves this.

I couldn't even get INTO treatment because I asked my psychiatrist if there were any eating disorder treatment options in the area and she looked me up and down and told me I didn't need to worry about it because I wasn't skinny enough. It was so humiliating. What's awful is I was actually 19 pounds underweight at the time she said that to me, but I had started out really overweight so I had a bunch loose skin that never tightened up so especially in clothing I just looked a lot bigger than I actually was unfortunately and I know it wasn't my brain making it up, I really did still look fat. Not even my doctor would give me a recommendation who knew my actual recorded weight and the fact that my heart rate was in the high 30s.",
