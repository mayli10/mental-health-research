Because when I went through that at 18 it was the worst body sensations of my entire life. \n\nBut my ED remembers it just as a time when I was eating cheese on every sandwich, Oreos dipped in Nutella, cream cheese on fruit, burgers with fries on outings, bacon with my breakfast, multiple servings of cereal, m&ms on ice cream, dinner rolls and bags of potato chips added to meals to have more starch, hummus with every single snack, Cliff bars without the guilt. Fuck guys why can\u2019t I just like.... eat this now?\n\nI was in IOP this summer with a girl who said her favorite thing about recovery is getting to eat a really good sounding meal/ snack every time instead of settling for fasting or binging. I want that in my life. I wanna enjoy my wonderful foods. Because I love food more than anything else. I love to cook. I love to eat. But I just gotta keep getting skinnier so I can finally eat?

I try to psych myself up all the time and think 'I could eat all of the food and what's the worst that could happen? I gain two pounds?\" The two times I tried giving into my extreme hunger, or binged, I freaked the fuck out and went immediately back to restricting because we are all dumb and even though we know gaining a lb or two wont kill us, quite the opposite actually, we act like it will. It sucks. My point is, don't do it. There is apparently never a number low enough.",

It makes them feel horrible, like horrible selfish people, like they're just doing it for attention. it's not just for attention, wanting attention is part of it, but it's not the way many outside of EDs would understand. it's about neglect and wanting to feeling cared for or loved, even though the attention you'll get from it is not that, just a replacement that will temporarily make you feel better. and in the long run worse. this feeling of being loved and cared for is only there when you're feeling shit, so it's a bit never ending. it's important to realise that that feeling isn't loving or caring and that the attention will not fulfil you. I know there are many other factors to starving yourself, but I think this one is a very big, unspoken one.",
