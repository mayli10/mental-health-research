The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her.

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her.

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

                            "Text": "I can believe that she wasn't aware of just how underweight she was because I've been there myself. When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

Do you think that's true, or was she probably just holding back her full story (which is understandable)? I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her. She definitely would've been labeled anorexic if she had body image issues and a fear of gaining, right?",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her.

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

                            "Text": "I can believe that she wasn't aware of just how underweight she was because I've been there myself. When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best.

Do you think that's true, or was she probably just holding back her full story (which is understandable)? I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her. She definitely would've been labeled anorexic if she had body image issues and a fear of gaining, right?",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

Isn't equipped as a interviewer and storyteller to deal with such a sensitive and seriously ill person's story\n2. Knows her story is slowly losing traction and he made the video now so he could milk the drama\n\nProps to Eugenia for starting her recovery and I couldn't be happier for her but we all know she doesn't strive from drama as Jeffree, Jake Paul and Tana do.

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her. She definitely would've been labeled anorexic if she had body image issues and a fear of gaining, right?",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

                            "Text": "I can believe that she wasn't aware of just how underweight she was because I've been there myself. When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best.

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her.

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

Do you think that's true, or was she probably just holding back her full story (which is understandable)? I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her. She definitely would've been labeled anorexic if she had body image issues and a fear of gaining, right?",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

Isn't equipped as a interviewer and storyteller to deal with such a sensitive and seriously ill person's story\n2.

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her.

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

                            "Text": "I can believe that she wasn't aware of just how underweight she was because I've been there myself. When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her.

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

Do you think that's true, or was she probably just holding back her full story (which is understandable)? I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her. She definitely would've been labeled anorexic if she had body image issues and a fear of gaining, right?",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her.

                            "Text": "It seems obvious to me that she was omitting the word anorexia because treatment taught her that EDs are so much more than just the physical transformation.  She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

                            "Text": "I can believe that she wasn't aware of just how underweight she was because I've been there myself. When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

She said that she had an eating disorder but never said that she was anorexic or that she intentionally restricted. She made it sound as though she was just severely underweight and didn't have the cognitive and emotional side of the disorder. It seemed like she hasn't really accepted that she has an eating disorder to me. \n\nI don't really know if that made sense but the video didn't really make sense to me so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

                            "Text": "I can believe that she wasn't aware of just how underweight she was because I've been there myself. When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The beginning of the video is like a montage of clips from her older vids showcasing how thin she was, spliced with vids of people talking about her, clips of people telling her to kill herself, etc. I think the most triggering aspect is the clips of her at her thinnest. She doesn't actually go into detail about her disorder, in fact she refuses to put a name to it (wouldn't say \"anorexic/anorexia\"). She also seems to be in a fair bit of denial but that's just my opinion. Like she says \"I *was* struggling with an eating disorder\" when we all know a few months in inpatient doesn't magically cure you.\n\nSo yeah, basically if you can't handle looking at her pre-recovery pics probably stay away. She's also obviously still pretty damn thin and would def still qualify as \"thinspo\" for a lot of people I'm sure.",

Do you think that's true, or was she probably just holding back her full story (which is understandable)? I know people can get obese by not realizing how much they're overeating and how seriously big they are, but I highly doubt that people can get *that* underweight by accident.\n\nShe said in the video that her treatment didn't label her. She definitely would've been labeled anorexic if she had body image issues and a fear of gaining, right?",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",

The brain is very good at retaining emotions and associating everything around it. Social media made her feel good about herself. Social media gave her a platform for body checks. Social media gave her an audience that has an interest in disordered relationships with food. Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best. I hope the recovery team will encourage her to have some education on the side, even if it's a remote degree. That will keep her mind occupied and will give her a purpose outside of social media.",

She was probably suffering from a litany of other mental health issues and to just call out the one about her appearance is simplifying the situation.  Plus talking about anorexia at length so early in recovery is triggering and focusing on weight, past lowest weight, and gains could make her relapse quickly.\n\nUnlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was \u201crewarded\u201d with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.  However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the ultimate catalyst for her ED wasn\u2019t depression/anxiety because mental illness is for sure the cause of all disorders.",

She said that she had an eating disorder but never said that she was anorexic or that she intentionally restricted. She made it sound as though she was just severely underweight and didn't have the cognitive and emotional side of the disorder. It seemed like she hasn't really accepted that she has an eating disorder to me. \n\nI don't really know if that made sense but the video didn't really make sense to me so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

                            "Text": "I can believe that she wasn't aware of just how underweight she was because I've been there myself. When I stepped on the scale and saw my LW (lowest I've ever been) it was hard to believe because I perceived myself to not look that thin at all and also felt like I was eating too much to weigh that little. However, I know for a fact I was nowhere even close to as thin as Eugenia was at my lowest. So while I think the actual number on the scale probably did shock her, I find it difficult to believe that she didn't know she was underweight. \n\nDid she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it. It's interesting but if true, maybe the treatment team was working from a place of thinking that labels hinder people? I definitely think based on how emaciated she was she would meet criteria for AN based on current DSM guidelines.",
