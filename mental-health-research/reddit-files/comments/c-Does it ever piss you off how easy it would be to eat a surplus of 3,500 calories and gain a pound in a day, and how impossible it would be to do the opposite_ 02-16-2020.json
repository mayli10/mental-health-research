I understand CICO but then there should also be temporary gain from water weight that can happen like if you have a meal that\u2019s particularly high in sodium or something. Idk I get the science of it but people on that sub make it seem like it\u2019s this easy quick fix where eat whatever you want for 6 hours and lose 30lbs! That said you\u2019re right and it probably is all CICO in the end even with the unhealthy eating.",

Weekends were spent sleeping, and I ate even less than on weekdays.\n\nBut oh boy could I fit a lot of calories into six hours or less of eating six days a week. I gained 40lb! In two years!",

Idk I get the science of it but people on that sub make it seem like it\u2019s this easy quick fix where eat whatever you want for 6 hours and lose 30lbs!

Weekends were spent sleeping, and I ate even less than on weekdays.\n\nBut oh boy could I fit a lot of calories into six hours or less of eating six days a week. I gained 40lb! In two years!",

Idk I get the science of it but people on that sub make it seem like it\u2019s this easy quick fix where eat whatever you want for 6 hours and lose 30lbs!

I understand CICO but then there should also be temporary gain from water weight that can happen like if you have a meal that\u2019s particularly high in sodium or something. Idk I get the science of it but people on that sub make it seem like it\u2019s this easy quick fix where eat whatever you want for 6 hours and lose 30lbs! That said you\u2019re right and it probably is all CICO in the end even with the unhealthy eating.",

Weekends were spent sleeping, and I ate even less than on weekdays.\n\nBut oh boy could I fit a lot of calories into six hours or less of eating six days a week. I gained 40lb! In two years!",

Idk I get the science of it but people on that sub make it seem like it\u2019s this easy quick fix where eat whatever you want for 6 hours and lose 30lbs!

Idk I get the science of it but people on that sub make it seem like it\u2019s this easy quick fix where eat whatever you want for 6 hours and lose 30lbs!

Never been an issue.",
