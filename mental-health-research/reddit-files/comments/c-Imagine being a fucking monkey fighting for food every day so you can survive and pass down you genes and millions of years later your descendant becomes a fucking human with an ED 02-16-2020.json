                    "Text": "This is a real thing. One of the other people in this thread mentioned famine as a possible type of \u201ctrauma\u201d causing changes in genes and it made me think of two studies I learned about in my college intro genetics class. So this phenomenon is called epigenetics, which is the study of genetic change in organisms by modification of gene expression (aka switching genes on and off). There was a famous study done on Dutch people who lived through a famine and the effects on their fetuses. Researchers looked at their DNA and the DNA of their children and found several patterns of methylation (a type of epigenetic modification that stops expression of genes) of DNA. One of which, for example, was linked to lower metabolism in their children and they theorized that these patterns may be related to the influence of the famine the parents experienced causing epigenetic changes in the developing fetus. Lower metabolism would have been beneficial for people living in famine, so it kinda makes sense why that may be passed on to offspring. Link to a NYT article that explains it in more simple terms: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.amp.html and Link to the primary paper if you\u2019re feeling sciencey: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao4364 \n\nThere\u2019s also a study that looked at epigenetics in rats. Rats that were licked/nurtured as pups (babies) ended up giving birth to relaxed pups, and rats that were not licked/nurtured as pups were more anxious and prone to disease compared to the first group. They found that methylation played a role here too. This also kinda makes sense because if you were a rat in a dangerous environment without a parent caring for you, you would benefit by being more \u201canxious\u201d so you could be more alert about predators and stuff. Link: https://sites.bu.edu/ombs/2010/11/11/licking-rat-pups-the-genetics-of-nurture/ and Link to primary paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1276\n\nThis shit is wild and there is so much more that needs to be studied so we can learn more about epigenetics. How that fits in with eating disorders is unclear to me and I\u2019m NOT saying EDs are associated with epigenetics. There\u2019s research that shows eating disorders have a genetic component but I don\u2019t know that they have studied epigenetic patterns of eating disorders (ugh they might have and feel free to look for some if you\u2019re curious but I have no idea). Also yeet disclaimer, I have a half-complete college biology degree so if anyone knows more than I do or if I explained that badly feel free to add more/correct me.\n\nEdit: typos",

I think it's common to not want to eat whenever you are anxious *even if you don't have an ED* so maybe in the past a lot of \"oh, they're just really anxious and don't want to eat\" would be considered EDs today.",
