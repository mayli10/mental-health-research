It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

                            "Text": "Water-solubility refers more to the metabolic process than the fact that you need to drink water for it to absorb (obviously its better if you do, but it will metabolize regardless because your body has water stores). It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Those are the ones that are in the textbook we use for the nutrition class I taught. While some of the plant sources have these nutrients, they are not as bioavailable. Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients. However, supplementation for anything is not necessary until a blood test confirms deficiency.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

It also implies how fast the turnover is - water-soluble vitamins (such as C and all the B's) are a short, 2-3 turnover because of limited storage in the body. Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue. That's why someone who eats a lot of beta carotene might have orange-toned palms from all of the vitamin A that's stored in the adipose.",

Iron is the worst offender because the most iron-rich plant will only be ~20% bioavailable at most and has oxalates that interfere with other nutrients.

Fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E,K) must have dietary fat to metabolize and can also store in your adipose tissue.

                "Text": "Oh my god that is a hilarious mental image, op. I just can't get over why she thinks that a bagel with cream cheese is a \"nice\" option to balance out being \"naughty\"??? Like?? If you ever get the opportunity to bring it up naturally I would die to find out what she was thinking and what she thought that a carby bagel loaded with dairy could possibly negate.\n\nI ab. solute. ly HATE people talking on and on about how they're going to start dieting or exercising when they have NO plan in mind. I don't necessarily think you need to do CICO, track your macros, or log all your meals to lose weight. But I DO think you need some base understanding of nutrition and portion control. But that requires self-education, and that's work. Nah, people would rather just stick with the same ambiguous idea of what \"healthy eating\" looks like that they were raised with and never question it again, ever.\n\nI actually enjoy talking about diets with people, to an extent, so I'm always happy to listen and offer advice (if requested) and support, but I'm so tired of people saying they're going to lose weight by \"eating right,\" and then it turns out they have no idea whatsoever about even the concept of calories, or portion sizes.  \nSo you get people who think pasta is healthy and end up eating 800+ cal in one meal because they don't know how depressingly small an actual portion of pasta is. You get people who drown everything in 200+ calories of pure fat because they heard that olive oil is good for you and, again, have no idea what a serving of olive oil looks like, or how many calories are in it, or even why that matters.  \nYou get people who actually eat MORE when they're dieting because they just add fruit and vegetables and protein powder and other \"healthy foods\" to their diet without really taking anything else out, so they're actually just consuming MORE calories. And then their version of going to the gym is going for half an hour twice a week and then having a big dinner as a reward. (I'm guilty of that last one, but that's part of why I pay so much attention to what I eat instead.)\n\nWhat sucks most is that you can't offer any advice. Because if they feel like their pre-existing, vague knowledge of nutrition is wrong, then they have nothing left to go on, and that can make you feel really helpless and insurmountable when faced with a problem like weight gain. But it's actually not difficult at all to do enough basic research about calories and macros and dieting in order to gain enough of an understanding to start losing weight (hell, just booping numbers into MFP or any other app for a couple of days will teach you most of what you need to know) - but research is boring, and sounds like hard work, so that puts them off, too. They're too scared to learn more, and they're too scared to acknowledge what they think they know is insufficient, so they just tread water. Then they wonder why they don't lose weight.\n\nThough I'd gladly put up with 10 \"eating right\" faux-dieters than 1 militant dieter who bores you to tears with their lunch's macros and their latest gym stats and why their one diet is the ONLY TRUE WAY to lose weight and there aren't any essential carbs etc etc etc when NOBODY ASKED. At least the would-be dieters are funny and not just grating :/",
