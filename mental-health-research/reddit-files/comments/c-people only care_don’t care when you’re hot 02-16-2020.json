                "Text": "Yes, this is an actual thing, and it can be very upsetting. I mean, there's a reason we call beauty \"attractive,\" right? Humans, on both a conscious and subconscious level, like to be near beauty. It makes us happy. It boosts our own self-esteem if we're nice to the pretty person and the pretty person is nice back (\"hey, they're treating me like we're equals! I'm not ugly! I'm a good, acceptable, attractive ape!\"). \n\nThen there's the whole projection thing. People tend to be kinder to those who don't remind us of our own fears/problems. Like, fatphobia isn't just a conditioned disgust response, it's also an expression of personal fear...people are scared to be fat. Whereas most people *want* to be trim, and are drawn to those who fulfill our aspirations. \n\nSo on the one hand, I can't blame others, especially if they seem to be thoughtful people who try not to judge the world by shallow criteria. But on the other...you never forget that feeling of, \"Oh, *now* we're friends?\" I was in middle school when I experienced that, and I'm pretty sure it permanently jacked up my trust in other people :/",

I've always been the type to smile and say good evening when I make eye contact with a stranger, and now people always at least return the smile. When I was fat that happened very rarely.

Even my boyfriend.\n\nBut you gotta remember that it's also the vibes you put out. I'm letting myself feel pretty and confident instead of calling myself an ugly fat gremlin and I know people can pick up on that. When I am in deeeep self loathing my boyfriend just leaves me alone. When I'm feeling cute and skinny he's all over me.\n\nWhich sounds shitty but I realize it's because on the other spectrum i put out \"don't fucking touch/look at/interact with me because I hate myself\" feelings.",
