I don\u2019t get embarrassed by that sort of stuff. I honestly think it\u2019s important to encourage a more neutral or supportive view on protection, depending on who is saying what. (Cashier vs parent) \n\nThey told me I looked like I was too young to be needing a condom. I was like...? \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think if I was too young to be having sex a condom would be the perfect addition? Y\u2019know.. so teen pregnancy doesn\u2019t happen?\u201d \n\nThen they got silent after that. \n\nAt the end of the night my friends didn\u2019t even have sex lol.",
