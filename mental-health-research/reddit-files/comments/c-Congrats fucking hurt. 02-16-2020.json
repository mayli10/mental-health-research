Even my family who knows I struggled with bulimia for years congratulates me, my boyfriend\u2019s parents said \u201cyou look amazing and you must feel wonderful!\u201d Yes I feel wonderful. My breath smells from purging I\u2019m lightheaded because I haven\u2019t eaten anything but coffee and green tea today, I have a breakdown every morning when I look in the mirror or weigh myself, yes I feel amazing. Idk it sucks because a lot of people don\u2019t assume eating disorder. My family thinks I\u2019m recovered enough to not let it affect me I guess but it hurts they haven\u2019t even checked up once to see if my bulimia relapsed. Like they just haven\u2019t asked. Even my boyfriend and my friend who I confessed my disordered thoughts and behaviors don\u2019t seem to care much. Okay my boyfriend does he wants to make sure I eat enough and don\u2019t purge but he still is happy I\u2019m losing weight and tells me I look great and I should be happy that he\u2019s proud of me but it just feeds into my fears that he wishes I were much skinnier. \n\nI don\u2019t know it\u2019s hard because like I said most people don\u2019t assume that. But I really want to get skinny enough that people start to get worried. It feels like everyone is happy that I\u2019m getting thin and no one cares how I get there",
