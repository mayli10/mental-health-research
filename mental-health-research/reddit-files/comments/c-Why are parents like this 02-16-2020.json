Parents don't realise how much their words can effect you, especially with sensitive topics like weight/food/appearence. Try to remember, she only sees you eat. She can't see the starvation or feel the hunger pangs or see the constant counting and ruminating. \n\nI never thought about my eating habits as a child until I was around seven or eight years old. I ate three chocolate eclaires. As ya know, a child given a box of cakes would do. And my whole family tore into me for it. Including my step-dad who weighs about 400lbs. My mother made me stay in my room all day and GROUNDED me for the only time in my life, because I ate three fucking pieces of cake. The topic of how fat and greedy I was became the talking point for the day for the whole family - they even let my grandparents and my aunt know about this apparently heinous thing I had done, even though they weren't fucking there! The tears and the shame that came with that whole day is what kickstarted my issues with food. It was the first time I was made to feel guilt and shame for eating.",

Anyway... \n\nMy mother always found a reason to talk to me while I ate, or ask questions to make me speak between bites. She would always find ways to comment on my food no matter what- a couple strawberries or a cup of ice cream it made no difference. I remember one time I snapped when she commented on how I was just eating whipped cream in a bowl and I flat out through the whole thing into the trash. \n\nSeriously let\u2019s all just ignore whenever our moms comment about our food please.",
