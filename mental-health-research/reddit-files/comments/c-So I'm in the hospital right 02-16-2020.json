I will also usually do a zero out of the bed every time I change the linens or the patient is out of bed working with therapy, just because sometimes extra blankets and things get added. \n\nThey're fairly accurate. I weighed myself in one the other day and it was only off by about 1 lb compared to the standing scale. ",
