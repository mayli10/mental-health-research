Celestial seasonings is my favorite brand by far. And the pomegranate white tea is so good too. \n\nPSA to those who like herbal tea especially mint, the Celestial Seasonings factory in Boulder, CO does tours and they have an entire room full of mint and they stand you in front of it and roll up the garage-style door and it\u2019s just this wave of mintyness that washes over you and it\u2019s basically a religious experience. Check it out if you are in the area, the whole tour is awesome but I\u2019ve gone back just for that moment.",
