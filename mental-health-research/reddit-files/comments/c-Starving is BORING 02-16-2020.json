                "Text": "Honestly this is why I relapsed. I started intermittent fasting to lose a little weight, then that moved onto OMAD, and finally fasting completely. But the boredom consumed me and I couldn\u2019t take the time standing still. Also I\u2019d inevitably binge at the end of every day.    \n\nSo that turned into me boiling eggs for when I was hungry, but no more than 1 a day. And then I realized if I just ate the egg white it\u2019s 1/3 of the calories. Oh and pickles are so low cal! Might as well keep those on hand. Rice cakes? Don\u2019t mind if I do! I\u2019m finishing my days with like 200cal after exercise and finally losing weight.     \n\nBefore I know it I\u2019m 25 and relapsing on my ED. *shocked pikachu face*",

I'm an adult now.\" Went vegetarian for the animals, then vegan for the animals, then saw pregnancy weight drop off, then was like \"I should diet and get back to where I was pre-marriage.\" Then I started going to uni again and working and raising my daughter and the stress started to consume me. Then divorce came and I was like \"I should make him jealous he lost me\" anddddd here we are again with disordered thinking. \n\nMoved back in to my mom's during the separation and gained weight, moved out into my boyfriend's a few weeks ago and I just sat down after work and was like \"I need to clean, give my daughter a bath, we need to work on summer reading, I need to update my planner, I need to find time for myself once she is asleep  because tomorrow is Friday and the hospital is fucking insane on friday's\" and then the thought crossed my mind, \"Did I eat today? Did I drink anything today? I don't have time to cook, I don't have energy to make anything. I have been doing this since I moved in, how many calories am I getting a day? I dont want more though, I'm fine. I feel fine. Everything is fine.\"",

                "Text": "Ugh yes. I can fast fine on weekdays because I have a full-time day job and it's much easier to say no to food at the office. Friday nights and weekends are hell however. There's not really a lot of options to stay busy - I could stay home (but there's food there); I could go out (but there's food outside and people usually want to socialize over food and I don't look good in anything anyway I can't go out) - I'm grateful for the rest over the weekends but I'd much rather be stuck at work the entire week if it means I won't eat.",
