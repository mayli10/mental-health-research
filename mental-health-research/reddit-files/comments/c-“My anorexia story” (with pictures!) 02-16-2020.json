Regardless of how many lbs different you are because BD doesn't paint a clear picture? \n\nThey probably don't include recovery methods because they arent professionals and they know it. Recovery is highly personalized and should be supervised by a medical professional. Not outlined for the sake of posterity and repeated behavior by viewers of youtube videos by patients. On top of that, recovery is hands down the hardest part of having an ED. You wanna rehash the shittiest mountain you've ever climbed, even when it might discourage people, simply because it's the hardest shit you've done? You don't have anything very positive to say about it yet, because it's still a work in progress, and you're supposed to profess to the masses about the wonderful, romanticized joys of recovery?
