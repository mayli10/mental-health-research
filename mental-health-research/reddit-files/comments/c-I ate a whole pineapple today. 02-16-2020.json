Alcohol is probably the worst thing on the list though. ~~I say after having thrown up a bunch after drinking too much on an empty stomach last night.~~ I think the weirdest thing I have consumed personally would probably be water with baking soda.

I could have either thrown up and settled my stomach or just neutralized the acid and settled it a different way. I think to throw up I would have had to drink it faster. It did taste really bad though. I also don't have much of a gag reflex, so I guess throwing up is hard for me.",

Unless there wasn't a purpose \ud83e\udd14 I guess citric acid is a weird one too. Lemons and alcohol seems pretty normal though. Alcohol is probably the worst thing on the list though. ~~I say after having thrown up a bunch after drinking too much on an empty stomach last night.~~ I think the weirdest thing I have consumed personally would probably be water with baking soda. It did help settle my stomach when I wanted to throw up once though, so I suppose it made sense? Not the intended result though.",

Unless there wasn't a purpose \ud83e\udd14 I guess citric acid is a weird one too. Lemons and alcohol seems pretty normal though. Alcohol is probably the worst thing on the list though. ~~I say after having thrown up a bunch after drinking too much on an empty stomach last night.~~ I think the weirdest thing I have consumed personally would probably be water with baking soda.

Unless there wasn't a purpose \ud83e\udd14 I guess citric acid is a weird one too. Lemons and alcohol seems pretty normal though. Alcohol is probably the worst thing on the list though. ~~I say after having thrown up a bunch after drinking too much on an empty stomach last night.~~ I think the weirdest thing I have consumed personally would probably be water with baking soda.

Alcohol is probably the worst thing on the list though. ~~I say after having thrown up a bunch after drinking too much on an empty stomach last night.~~ I think the weirdest thing I have consumed personally would probably be water with baking soda.

Alcohol is probably the worst thing on the list though. ~~I say after having thrown up a bunch after drinking too much on an empty stomach last night.~~ I think the weirdest thing I have consumed personally would probably be water with baking soda.

I could have either thrown up and settled my stomach or just neutralized the acid and settled it a different way. I think to throw up I would have had to drink it faster. It did taste really bad though. I also don't have much of a gag reflex, so I guess throwing up is hard for me.",
