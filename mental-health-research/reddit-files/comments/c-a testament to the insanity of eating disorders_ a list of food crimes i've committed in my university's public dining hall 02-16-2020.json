                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

                    "Text": "I had a teacher in high school that made me have a \u201cbathroom buddy\u201d in her class cause someone caught me purging after lunch \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI got kicked out of colorguard (with the marching band not like ROTC or whatever) because I was \u201ctoo triggering\u201d for other members to be around after I got out of ED rehab. They wanted me to sign a \u201chealth contract\u201d to be weighed in every week and have \u201creal meals\u201d which were to be logged on days of rehearsals in order to participate. Guess who didn\u2019t do colorguard her senior year of hs. Also self harm was a huge issue when I was 14/15 and no one noticed that?\n\nI went to a public school. Tbh, WHERE WAS THIS when I was sitting UNDER my desk when I was 14 taking notes in class while sobbing because I was terrified of people looking at me? Also how did no one took notice enough to call my parents when I showed up almost every day of my senior year piss ass drunk or lying about diarrhea to the nurse so I could go home and get high again? \n\nEdit to add: I did so much of this in college when I was on campus my first year. I also waltzed out with 35 apples \u201chidden\u201d on my person just to see if I could do it bc my roommate took 25 bananas and got caught. I was successful on that mission. ",

It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

I have to avoid swiping into my dining hall (or even getting close to it since I can\u2019t resist going in otherwise) because if I do I\u2019ll eat 5 cookies, 3 chocolate brownies, and a slice of cake with all of that dipped in vanilla soft serve along with a slice of pizza and some grilled cheese. Afterwards I need to punish and hate myself further for being a fatass so I\u2019ll exit the dining hall and head over to the To-Go section of my school\u2019s mart and buy chicken tenders, fries, and a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream.

                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

I have to avoid swiping into my dining hall (or even getting close to it since I can\u2019t resist going in otherwise) because if I do I\u2019ll eat 5 cookies, 3 chocolate brownies, and a slice of cake with all of that dipped in vanilla soft serve along with a slice of pizza and some grilled cheese. Afterwards I need to punish and hate myself further for being a fatass so I\u2019ll exit the dining hall and head over to the To-Go section of my school\u2019s mart and buy chicken tenders, fries, and a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream. I\u2019m usually in so much pain afterwards that I NEED to purge in order to feel physically better. It sucks so much ",

                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

Like a high school cafeteria you got one main dish, a side, a shitty baked good, and a  drink and that was is. And even being a restrictive hoe i would lose my mind there. I hate people telling me what i can and cant do with the food I\u2019m paying for thank you very much. I would bring in an empty backpack and load it up with those little plastic cups of cornflakes and bran cereal. And take so much hummus and veggies, and shove they prepackaged avocado sushi rolls. I just hated them telling me what to eat. And would take it all back to my dorm room and almost never eat it. I was just angrythey wouldnt let me get the safe foods i wanted.\n\nI dropped my little sister off at college this summer and ate in the djning hall that night and just the setup was gently triggering.

                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",

The cashier even asked me if I wanted any actual food. \n*Pour myself a bowl of chocolate chips, grab a knife and the jar of peanut butter.

I have to avoid swiping into my dining hall (or even getting close to it since I can\u2019t resist going in otherwise) because if I do I\u2019ll eat 5 cookies, 3 chocolate brownies, and a slice of cake with all of that dipped in vanilla soft serve along with a slice of pizza and some grilled cheese. Afterwards I need to punish and hate myself further for being a fatass so I\u2019ll exit the dining hall and head over to the To-Go section of my school\u2019s mart and buy chicken tenders, fries, and a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream.

                        "Text": "Much agreed. I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn\u2019t actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn\u2019t alone in this. She agreed to be my \u201cfood buddy\u201d instead of the person that forced me to eat while she watched. I think that probably saved my life, but the point I\u2019m making here is that the first part absolutely shouldn\u2019t have happened. Singling someone out to talk about things they\u2019re not qualified to talk about, or ask you about in the first place, is absolutely unfair and ridiculous. When I have been in those situations, it made me feel attacked and also like super garbage, more garbage than usual. That approach did not help me in any way, but it did fuck shit up ",
