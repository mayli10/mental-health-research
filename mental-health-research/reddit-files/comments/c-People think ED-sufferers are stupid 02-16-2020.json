It basically equates that \u2018normal eating\u2019 is uncontrolled eating that you\u2019ll never be able to overcome, meaning your ED seems even safer and normal is scary\n\n3. It reduces our complex mental illnesses to a simple diet gone wrong rather than a coping strategy and, um,  yknow, being a *complex mental illness*\n\n\nAnd again, logic isn\u2019t lost with people with eds. We know what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t healthy, has many potential consequences including *death*, we know *deep inside* losing weight doesn\u2019t fix anything, we *know*.\n\nMy old psych said: Untreated, eating disorder behaviours are about as uncontrollable as panic attacks. They just happen and will continue to happen in increased severity until you make a sustained effort to counter and change the way your brain responds stimulus",

It\u2019s not like anyone is pointing out the logically inconsistencies of my other unhealthy coping mechanisms or trying to trick me out of them with unverified \u201cfacts\u201d or pointing out the logically fallacies in my compulsions because they are just that: compulsive. \n\nLike nobody has ever tried to \u201chelp\u201d my trichotillomania by saying, \u201cYou know if you keep pulling your hair out it will actually grow back twice as fast,\u201d because even if people can\u2019t understand the compulsion or that it\u2019s a coping mechanism for the anxiety I feel they intuitively know I\u2019m not doing it because I actually just want the hair to not grow back again. It\u2019s clearly more complex than that and I don\u2019t know why people then tend to believe that someone with an ED is so one dimensional that their only driving reason is some innate vanity that needs to be preyed on to break them of it. Not a complex disorder thats motivation varies for each individual and is very often co-morbid with other mental health issues.",

Of course you run into problems when people are underweight, but r/fasting has people who were hundreds of pounds (400+) who literally stopped eating for months (but with supplements and fluids) and were still going to work, etc.\n\nIn any case, I see these kinds of statements as overgeneralized and oversimplified.

                        "Text": "Repeatedly I got bullshit about how the body uses energy that was grossly oversimplified at best, or perhaps willfully lying at worst. They basically tried to convince us that your liver can only store 12 hours of energy before your brain and body won\u2019t function sufficiently.\n\n1) Almost every textbook of mine said 24 hours, not 12, but it\u2019s a moot point because\n\n2) Ketones exist. Of course you run into problems when people are underweight, but r/fasting has people who were hundreds of pounds (400+) who literally stopped eating for months (but with supplements and fluids) and were still going to work, etc.\n\nIn any case, I see these kinds of statements as overgeneralized and oversimplified. They\u2019re pretty clearly going for a scare tactic, as if we might snap out of it by saying \u201comg, this is unhealthy?!?! Now that I know, I\u2019m cured!\u201d As if we aren\u2019t facing far bigger fear-induced barriers. Give me a fucking break.",

                            "Text": "It\u2019s so strange to me the tactics people use for EDs. It\u2019s not like anyone is pointing out the logically inconsistencies of my other unhealthy coping mechanisms or trying to trick me out of them with unverified \u201cfacts\u201d or pointing out the logically fallacies in my compulsions because they are just that: compulsive. \n\nLike nobody has ever tried to \u201chelp\u201d my trichotillomania by saying, \u201cYou know if you keep pulling your hair out it will actually grow back twice as fast,\u201d because even if people can\u2019t understand the compulsion or that it\u2019s a coping mechanism for the anxiety I feel they intuitively know I\u2019m not doing it because I actually just want the hair to not grow back again. It\u2019s clearly more complex than that and I don\u2019t know why people then tend to believe that someone with an ED is so one dimensional that their only driving reason is some innate vanity that needs to be preyed on to break them of it. Not a complex disorder thats motivation varies for each individual and is very often co-morbid with other mental health issues.",
