                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful...

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

                        "Text": "So glad you found it helpful! IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts.

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful...

                        "Text": "So glad you found it helpful! IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

                        "Text": "So glad you found it helpful! IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

                        "Text": "So glad you found it helpful! IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

                        "Text": "So glad you found it helpful! IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

                        "Text": "So glad you found it helpful! IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                            "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

                            "Text": "So glad you found it helpful! IE is pretty wild. If you let yourself have unlimited cookies every day, after a few days you're just like...yeah I'm good. And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

I have been off of it the past couple of weeks but today was so awful and i went to basically binge mode and made the decision to go back to my regularly scheduled meal plan. I eat baked chicken and boiled zucchini for lunch and a slaw salad with 50 cals of balsamic for dinner. Sometimes for a treat I\u2019ll have two squares of Lindt sea salt dark chocolate. Oat Yeah! Milk in my coffee. I fucking hate myself for today and i have got to turn it around or all the progress I\u2019ve made will be ruined. I used to also plan out my Saturday cheat meal meticulously so there would be no unexpected surprises or anything like that. God i was so in control. I feel crazy and like I\u2019m losing it now.\n\nBut yeah, knowing exactly what to expect helps with the day to day mental aspect because I\u2019ve got the week logged and know exactly what I\u2019m eating so there\u2019s no anxiety about it.",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

I have been off of it the past couple of weeks but today was so awful and i went to basically binge mode and made the decision to go back to my regularly scheduled meal plan. I eat baked chicken and boiled zucchini for lunch and a slaw salad with 50 cals of balsamic for dinner. Sometimes for a treat I\u2019ll have two squares of Lindt sea salt dark chocolate. Oat Yeah! Milk in my coffee. I fucking hate myself for today and i have got to turn it around or all the progress I\u2019ve made will be ruined. I used to also plan out my Saturday cheat meal meticulously so there would be no unexpected surprises or anything like that. God i was so in control. I feel crazy and like I\u2019m losing it now.\n\nBut yeah, knowing exactly what to expect helps with the day to day mental aspect because I\u2019ve got the week logged and know exactly what I\u2019m eating so there\u2019s no anxiety about it.",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",

                        "Text": "What I did to recover, in order:\n\n1. Therapy \u2014 I started going to therapy to address the underlying issues that were going on when the ED first developed (for me, childhood trauma and abuse), rather than the ED behaviors specifically. Nothing against ED-focused therapists, but I\u2019ve always seen my ED as a symptom of bigger issues rather than THE problem in my life. Processing trauma and learning healthier ways of coping and relating overall has gotten me to a place where I could start to tackle the ED.\n\n2. Transitioning to less restrictive diets \u2014 this might not work for everyone, but before I was ready to completely give up restricting behaviors, I took steps toward less and less restrictive diets. So I went from extreme restriction to strict calorie counting to WW. WW points are good because there are certain foods you can eat in \u201cunlimited\u201d quantities (fruits and vegetables, lean proteins). So it felt like a \u201csafer\u201d way to practice eating more flexibly but I could still indulge in a lot of ED behaviors, if that makes sense.\n\n3. Eliminate cardio \u2014 switching to gentle strength training (barre/yoga/Pilates) from cardio helped a lot because it cut my appetite WAY down, which made the restrict/binge cycles a lot less intense. I think it also just made me more aware and appreciative of my body in general, in a good way. Like enhancing the mind-body connection instead of numbing it with super long runs. \n\n4. Faith \u2014 realize this is not for everyone, but prayer and meditation (especially on [this verse](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/PSA.139.13-14.NIV) has made a big difference. Happy to talk more over PM if anyone is curious.\n\n5. Commit to intuitive eating \u2014 when I got to a place where I was sick and tired and \nfinally ready to be done for good, I really went all in on IE. I read the books, I followed all the bloggers and instagram RDs, I found support groups. I basically had to re-learn how to eat like I was an alien (and tbh I basically was, because I\u2019d been living on Planet ED for 10+ years). It was incredibly uncomfortable at first, but it\u2019s gotten easier and easier over time. [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Intuitive-Eating-Revolutionary-Program-Works/dp/1250004047/ref=asc_df_1250004047/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=74118469329&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=353842596182&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4975949619553173631&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9008188&hvtargid=pla-434232791693) helped a lot, and also reading [the Real Life RD\u2019s](https://www.thereallife-rd.com) older blog posts. There are IE Instagram accounts like [diet culture rebel](https://instagram.com/diet.culture.rebel?igshid=j0vfv889i0e6) and [no food rules](https://instagram.com/no.food.rules?igshid=1ayyouolvlzik) where you can get a lot of support in the comments.",

I always thought making rules about food was normal, but this ig swiftly taught me otherwise.. I've just felt so depressed about food lately and not really wanting to eat at all, but *shocked pikachu face* maybe not actually eating what I want to eat in reasonable amounts is making me super miserable! And yet if I buy something I actually want to eat, I eat it all right away because I don't want anyone else to take it from me, except I live by myself now, and that kind of feels like a separate issue so it's been pretty difficult trying to figure everything out.\n\nI know someone who is kind of going through the same thing, and I never realized that I was encouraging their rule-creating behavior and that it might actually have been really harmful... Yikes. :/ So I'm really glad you shared this and helped me realize this so I don't keep doing it. Seriously, thank you so much.",

And then you wake up and you're a person who can keep cookies in the house without bingeing. \n\nIf you decide to start IE, my best tip for when you start eating \"fear foods\" is to keep A LOT of them in the house. IMO it makes you less likely to binge because you know there's more left so no one can \"take it away from you\". So I'd recommend buying multiple pints of ice cream and multiple bags of chips at first. I also sometimes find it helpful to keep a food diary with no amounts/macros/ingredients -- just a list and then some thoughts about how it made me feel physically and mentally and how the experience was. It helped me practice being more mindful during an eating experience and realize \"hey, this food doesn't really make me feel great\" or \"wow, i have a lot of emotions attached to this particular food\" or \"yup, i was definitely wanting to use restriction/bingeing as a coping mechanism because of XYZ\"",
