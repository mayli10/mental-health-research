It\u2019s threads like these (where everyone\u2019s like \u201cDiet Coke 4 life!\u201d that remind me how much I must have drank before Haha. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how different my quality of life is going from \u201caverage\u201d (read: caffeine addicted\\*\\*\\*) consumption to low consumption - human subjective memory is bad and ED, nutrient deprived brain exponentially so. But I definitely get to \u201dbenefit\u201d from \u201dusing\u201d caffeine more like a performance enhancer than before, like I avoid it for a few days and take a \u201dhigh\u201c dose (like 200-400mg, equivalent to couple cups of coffee) whether just to feel good all around (more espresso less depresso is real! and sometimes I can feel my muscles tingle in a good way) or to boost gym performance or (disorderly) fasting (mostly to get out of a bad cycle but still disorderly). \n\nIn order for a \u201creasonable\u201d dose like that to hit so hard and feel like a performance enhancer, I need to keep my tolerance low and really avoid it all other days - including from tea and diet cokes. Think it\u2019s worth it, for now?? Lol. Pardon my rambling, it\u2019s late and I guess I\u2019m in some kind of mood.   \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*I think many people are caffeine addicted, depending on it every morning but I\u2019m indiff\u00e9rent about it being good or bad; personally I just don\u2019t want to be because I get nasty withdrawal if I don\u2019t have it for a day when dependent like that.   \nStill love coffee, so have lots of decaf now.",

It\u2019s threads like these (where everyone\u2019s like \u201cDiet Coke 4 life!\u201d that remind me how much I must have drank before Haha. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how different my quality of life is going from \u201caverage\u201d (read: caffeine addicted\\*\\*\\*) consumption to low consumption - human subjective memory is bad and ED, nutrient deprived brain exponentially so. But I definitely get to \u201dbenefit\u201d from \u201dusing\u201d caffeine more like a performance enhancer than before, like I avoid it for a few days and take a \u201dhigh\u201c dose (like 200-400mg, equivalent to couple cups of coffee) whether just to feel good all around (more espresso less depresso is real! and sometimes I can feel my muscles tingle in a good way) or to boost gym performance or (disorderly) fasting (mostly to get out of a bad cycle but still disorderly). \n\nIn order for a \u201creasonable\u201d dose like that to hit so hard and feel like a performance enhancer, I need to keep my tolerance low and really avoid it all other days - including from tea and diet cokes. Think it\u2019s worth it, for now?? Lol. Pardon my rambling, it\u2019s late and I guess I\u2019m in some kind of mood.   \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*I think many people are caffeine addicted, depending on it every morning but I\u2019m indiff\u00e9rent about it being good or bad; personally I just don\u2019t want to be because I get nasty withdrawal if I don\u2019t have it for a day when dependent like that.   \nStill love coffee, so have lots of decaf now.",
