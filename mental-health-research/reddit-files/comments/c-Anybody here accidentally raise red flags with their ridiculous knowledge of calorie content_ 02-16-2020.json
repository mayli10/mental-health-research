I told him he doesn\u2019t eat enough (he just doesn\u2019t care about food? Like how...?). And he was saying how his breakfast is substantial and I was giving him a calorie rundown of what he eats off the top of my head\n\nHe later told me I have an eating disorder and completely called my ass out about my calorie knowledge.

Or maybe he thinks I'm faking... idk. But he'll tell me how he ate SO much during one meal or one day and I'll be like \"Babe. No.\" Then tell him exactly how many calories are in each thing he describes. It ends up being way lower than he thought. He just eats until he's full and has no desire to keep going or snack if he's not actually physically hungry. He's also 6'1\" and like 140 lbs. I'd trade him body types and hunger drives in a flat second.",
