So for this recipe, I used 180g of my protein powder (Ghost Vegan Pancake Batter, in case you're wondering. It's awesome for baking. Only used it once for a shake lol).",

Stick it in the freezer while you cut and peel the apples. \n\nI follow a recipe from Live Well Bake Often. She has traditional apple pie, mini pies, and hand pies. All need the above crust recipe. It makes plenty for a bottom crust and a top crust. I sub honey for the sugar in any of the pies. Super, super easy.",

So for this recipe, I used 180g of my protein powder (Ghost Vegan Pancake Batter, in case you're wondering. It's awesome for baking. Only used it once for a shake lol).",

It makes plenty for a bottom crust and a top crust. I sub honey for the sugar in any of the pies. Super, super easy.",

Stick it in the freezer while you cut and peel the apples. \n\nI follow a recipe from Live Well Bake Often. She has traditional apple pie, mini pies, and hand pies. All need the above crust recipe. It makes plenty for a bottom crust and a top crust. I sub honey for the sugar in any of the pies. Super, super easy.",

                    "Text": "\\&gt;But even here, orcas separate. Like humans, they are the highest evolution of their line \u2013 even compared to other dolphins, their societies are more cohesive, full of etiquette, with distinctive cultures, dialects, and social manners \u2013 as opposed to brutally primitive dolphins that routinely indulge in gang rape and cannibalism.   In this light, dolphins are like savage Neanderthals compared to the Cro-Magnon orca.  \n\nSo, uh, your entire knowledge of non-orca dolphins is restricted to news articles about things that only male bottlenose dolphins have been observed to do, ignoring both female bottlenose dolphins and all 30-odd other species in their entirety? Because if you'd pulled back a bit on a singular obsession with one species, you'd have seen that many other species of dolphin have cohesive social groups, do not rape, do not engage in cannibalism, and indeed, are every bit as socially complicated and wonderful as orcas. Other species have dialects and social manners and etiquette, and orcas are *not* in fact more \"civilised\" than the other dolphins at all. If you think all other species of dolphin are \"brutally primitive\", that shows you're so obsessed with orcas that you've never bothered to learn about the others at all, apart from a couple of sensational news articles.\n\nI would also like to draw your attention to the fact that the Southern Resident orcas would rather breed father-to-daughter and mother-to-son than even *speak* to other populations of Resident orcas. They could save themselves from inbreeding themselves into extinction if they weren't racist bigots who refuse to even interact with the Northern Residents. That's not very civilised at all.\n\nIn fact, orcas' \"etiquette\" is nothing more than narrow-minded adherence to tradition at the expense of adaptation to changing circumstances and civilised behaviour towards individuals outside of their own families. \n\nUnlike orcas, other dolphins will learn new behaviours in order to adapt to changing situations. If one type of fish isn't available, they'll find another. If one type of hunting behaviour doesn't work anymore, they'll work out another way to hunt. Orcas are literally the only dolphins that would rather starve to death than eat something different or learn a new way of hunting.\n\nUnlike orcas, who only care about their own immediate social group, other dolphins actually have wider social lives that includes cooperation with unrelated individuals *and* cross-species cooperation. Those bottlenose dolphins you write off as being \"brutally primitive\" routinely work together with other species to find food... which they hunt together, utilising both species' capabilities, and then *share* the food equally. Across species lines. There are actually remarkably few species on the entire planet that are capable of that, but most species of dolphin are.\n\nExcluding orcas. They won't work with other species. They won't cooperate while hunting with other species, because that would mean sharing with not-orcas. They won't adopt orphaned calves unless it's an immediate relative (ie, the calf is a sibling, niece/nephew or grandchild). If it's not closely related, it's left to die. Transient orcas have even been recorded practising infanticide. And an orphan of another species? No orca would ever care.\n\nA dolphin would, though. \n\nOne of those \"barbaric\" bottlenose dolphins led a stranded a pair of pygmy sperm whales back out to sea through shallow water they couldn't navigate on their own (after humans' attempts at helping failed). This was a wild dolphin, not a captive one following humans' orders. It saw that the whales needed help, and it helped of its own free will. *That is civilised!*\n\nJust a month ago in Taiji, a pod of rough-toothed dolphins with an adopted pilot whale pod member were driven into the cove, and the rough-toothed dolphins were just as distressed by the pilot whale being hurt as they were by their own species being hurt. *That is civilised!*\n\nOrcas are pretty much the only species of dolphin that *won't* interact with other species of cetacean. Their \"etiquette\" is in fact systemic racism and bigotry, which other species of dolphin typically do *not* possess. You do other species a massive disservice by not only refusing to actually learn about how empathetic and gentle they truly are, but also by focusing so closely on orcas that you cannot see their flaws. Orcas are amazing creatures, yes, but they're not perfect, and their societies aren't \"better\" than other cetaceans. Their focus on following highly specific rituals and traditions is interesting... but it's not inherently more civilised. In many ways, they're *less* civilised due to their inability to empathise with other species.\n\nIf I had to choose which was more barbaric, the dolphins who cooperate with and help others across their whole species and indeed outside of it, or the orcas who would happily watch every cetacean on the planet die as long as it didn't affect their immediate relatives... my vote is on the dolphins as being the more empathetic and civilised creatures.\n\nAnd your knowledge of Neanderthals is entirely non-existent. Because if you'd bothered to research *that*, you would know that if you compare Neanderthals to humans *at the same point in history*, neither one was more advanced or less \"barbaric\" than the others. When the Neanderthals went extinct, they were at the same technology level as humans were. They had their own tools. They had musical instruments. They made cave paintings. Neanderthals only look \"primitive\" if you compare them to humans *now*, which isn't a fair comparison at all, because humans have had thousands of years to develop. When you compare like-for-like, at the same point in history, they're both about the same. \n\nIn some archaeological studies, there's evidence that the Neanderthals may actually have been the gentler, less aggressive ones, which is part of why humans drove them extinct. Humans weren't more civilised. They were just more enthusiastic about killing.\n\nIf you truly care about cetaceans, stop idealising just one species while dismissing all the others as inferior. *All* cetaceans are amazing. *All* deserve our respect. *All* are worthy of being studied and researched, and admired for their traits. And remember that while orcas' culture is fascinating, it's not a utopia of love and tolerance. Orcas are devoted to their families, but to the complete exclusion of those who aren't related to them... and that's not something to aspire to, or to see as a superior way of life.",

Stick it in the freezer while you cut and peel the apples. \n\nI follow a recipe from Live Well Bake Often. She has traditional apple pie, mini pies, and hand pies. All need the above crust recipe. It makes plenty for a bottom crust and a top crust. I sub honey for the sugar in any of the pies. Super, super easy.",
