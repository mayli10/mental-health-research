My brain translated this into being fat. I saw boys crushing on \u201cskinnier\u201d girls (it was actually just pre pubescent girls) and I would try to wear bras that flattened my chest. I\u2019d work out in my bedroom. I got my workouts from teen magazines. My food issues didn\u2019t come until I was like 15 but the exercise compulsion started early :(",

                "Text": "My ED started developing when I was 11-12 yrs old and I started doing something similar, so by the time I was 12 or 13 I had cut out most junk foods, any dairy product that wasnt yogurt, never used butter or sugar or cheese or sour cream or anything like that. Even when I became normal weight and somewhat stable, I still didn't eat all those things literally until I turned 18, when I started dating my ex and ended up at his house for dinner a lot. I didn't want to reject his parent's food (and they ARE incredible cooks) so I had to start eating all those things again. I ended up at his place w his family for meals a lot (and I still do) and they taught me to love all those foods i cut out and pretended to hate and was so scared of. \n\nEven now that I'm relapsed I still try to include foods like that under my cal limit and even if I can't eat them on my own, I can always go over to hang out w his mom (I was on the verge of being kicked out when we met and really bonded w his family) and cook with her and feel okay eating again. I know you're scared but you can find a safe space where you can nurture yourself at portions of delicious things that you're comfortable with. It is upsetting but these foods will always exist and they are here for your enjoyment when you're ready to turn to them.",

I mean, my ED took an ugly turn halfway through high school and I don't wish that on anyone... it was quite invisible for a while, so I find your post relatable. Maybe tell your mom that you want to prevent your ED from getting any worse to avoid possible depression and anxiety symptoms from developing if they haven't already?",

I skipped dinner, the first of many times, and I cried myself to sleep, feeling like it was an inevitable part of my identity now.  I became obsessed with counting calories and how much I was or wasn't eating.  I would drink a glass of water that would keep me from eating because I felt bloated and then reward myself with a piece of chewing gum.  I lost 30 pounds in a month.  Its been 7 years since that time, and I can finally say that after getting treatment and taking medications, I'm finally starting to get over it.  It took me a long time but you can get there.  Reaching out for help and opening up to people can be scary but its worth it.  Most people are more understanding than you think.  It took me four therapists and a psychiatrist to get here but the work has been worth it.  Keep pushing.  The fact that you recognise your problem is a good first step.  It's hard to get help but so worth all the effort in the end.  You can do it",
