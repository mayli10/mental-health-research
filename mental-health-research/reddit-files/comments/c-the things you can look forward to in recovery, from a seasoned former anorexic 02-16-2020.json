I am not a therapist or doctor, I gave context to those who asked, I told those who asked how I did it, I gave some encouraging words, but I didn\u2019t mean to be insensitive towards you.

I am not a therapist or doctor, I gave context to those who asked, I told those who asked how I did it, I gave some encouraging words, but I didn\u2019t mean to be insensitive towards you.

I realized that I have the option to live, I have the option to not be in a hospital bed, he didn\u2019t though, cancer won. \n\nI decided to start obsessing about other things. I decided to start measuring my life goals, since life is too short to not think about it. I started counting my blessings in life. I started obsessing about my well-being and living a normal, healthy life, I started obsessing about my work and school and family and loved ones instead. \n\nOur personalities don\u2019t fade. But what we channel them into can change, only if we want them to. I just decided to let go one day, and I did everything I could to.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t instant.... don\u2019t get me wrong. It wasn\u2019t easy either, it was actually quite horrible. But once I gained weight and stopped thinking about food, I realized I had started to think about so much else, so much more of my life, good shit started happening to me, I got better at my job, I got a raise, got better at grad school, I started dating again, I had plans almost every night, I would start eating with people instead of alone and make it about connecting to others instead of stuffing my face. \n\nLife just changed as soon as my headspace freed up. Life is still not perfect, obviously. I lost my best friend, trauma that I can\u2019t unsee, ever. I struggle every day with other things, question whether I\u2019m good enough at my job, what I\u2019ll do after I get my degree, where my relationships are going, if my family is okay, etc. etc. but they\u2019re no longer about food is all. Which trust me, is much better. Because the former impacts the life around you and the latter impacts the life within you.",

Your perspective of food will shift and evolve into something healthier for you. If you skip a meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be about losing weight and you  don\u2019t have to do it again.

                    "Text": "Sure. I am 5\u20198\u201d, I was 100 pounds, I struggled with anorexia (technically binge purge subtype but I never purged physically, I binged and restricted) on and off since I was 12 but this time it was the worst. I was underweight for 3 years, pretty consistently, but it quickly turned into a raging binge/restrict cycle for about a year (most miserable year of my entire life). After my best friend died, I sought help, I was outpatient, saw the doctors once a week, learned about nutrition, got therapy, ate 3500+ calories a day for a month (more like 5000....), then lowered to 3000, then 2500, then no calorie minimum after 3 months. I learned where this all stemmed from, I made the decision to let go of that, I got my period back, I stopped weekly treatment after the first month since I was doing super well, I then went bi weekly for a month, then once a month, sometimes twice a month, from Feb-June. I gained ~35 pounds in 2 months (lol no joke, it was horrifying) but then didn\u2019t gain anything after that. I gained super quick and my weight stabilized pretty quickly. I only recently found out what my weight was, and it didn\u2019t really faze me, I was just happy that it hasn\u2019t changed in a few months, this means that my body is likely happy and working again. I recently got cleared for exercise (WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE I LOVE BIKING AND THE ELLIPTICAL), I am no longer out patient but I\u2019m required to go back in 3 months to see if my weight is the same, but so far it\u2019s been stable for 5 months. \n\nAll in all, the whole process took about half a year to get to this place, but I would say it became easier after the first 2 months. The first 2 months are the hardest but once you gain the weight and no longer feel the need to overeat, your mind starts thinking of things besides food and things start to get much better. Then maybe 4 months in, one day i woke up and realized I didn\u2019t think about food when I first opened my eyes, and that was a good morning.",

If you convince yourself this part of you will never go away, then you\u2019re correct. But you don\u2019t have to tell yourself that and it doesn\u2019t have to be true for you. You don\u2019t have to think of your ED as a domesticated panther that\u2019ll pounce you again if you get too wild with food lol. Your perspective of food will shift and evolve into something healthier for you. If you skip a meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be about losing weight and you  don\u2019t have to do it again. If you eat 5 cookies, you don\u2019t have to binge and think that you\u2019ll never have cookies again. Those just aren\u2019t your options anymore.

Your perspective of food will shift and evolve into something healthier for you. If you skip a meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be about losing weight and you  don\u2019t have to do it again.

If you convince yourself this part of you will never go away, then you\u2019re correct. But you don\u2019t have to tell yourself that and it doesn\u2019t have to be true for you. You don\u2019t have to think of your ED as a domesticated panther that\u2019ll pounce you again if you get too wild with food lol. Your perspective of food will shift and evolve into something healthier for you. If you skip a meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be about losing weight and you  don\u2019t have to do it again. If you eat 5 cookies, you don\u2019t have to binge and think that you\u2019ll never have cookies again. Those just aren\u2019t your options anymore.

Your perspective of food will shift and evolve into something healthier for you. If you skip a meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be about losing weight and you  don\u2019t have to do it again. If you eat 5 cookies, you don\u2019t have to binge and think that you\u2019ll never have cookies again. Those just aren\u2019t your options anymore.

If you convince yourself this part of you will never go away, then you\u2019re correct. But you don\u2019t have to tell yourself that and it doesn\u2019t have to be true for you. You don\u2019t have to think of your ED as a domesticated panther that\u2019ll pounce you again if you get too wild with food lol. Your perspective of food will shift and evolve into something healthier for you. If you skip a meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be about losing weight and you  don\u2019t have to do it again. If you eat 5 cookies, you don\u2019t have to binge and think that you\u2019ll never have cookies again. Those just aren\u2019t your options anymore.

If you convince yourself this part of you will never go away, then you\u2019re correct. But you don\u2019t have to tell yourself that and it doesn\u2019t have to be true for you. You don\u2019t have to think of your ED as a domesticated panther that\u2019ll pounce you again if you get too wild with food lol. Your perspective of food will shift and evolve into something healthier for you. If you skip a meal, it doesn\u2019t have to be about losing weight and you  don\u2019t have to do it again. If you eat 5 cookies, you don\u2019t have to binge and think that you\u2019ll never have cookies again. Those just aren\u2019t your options anymore.
