Homemade mashed potatoes are never as good as restaurant because no self-respecting stay at home mom would ever think to use a ratio of 1:1 butter:potatoes. I\u2019ve read that in many (if not all) fast food franchises, they deliberately add a shit-ton more sour cream, butter, etc. to their recipes, so their calorie counts listed are off by hundreds probably. \n\nSometimes I hate going out to eat. (It\u2019s a fun \u201ccheat meal\u201d though so I mostly like it even if I do always pick the healthiest and most low-cal option)",

Homemade mashed potatoes are never as good as restaurant because no self-respecting stay at home mom would ever think to use a ratio of 1:1 butter:potatoes. I\u2019ve read that in many (if not all) fast food franchises, they deliberately add a shit-ton more sour cream, butter, etc. to their recipes, so their calorie counts listed are off by hundreds probably. \n\nSometimes I hate going out to eat. (It\u2019s a fun \u201ccheat meal\u201d though so I mostly like it even if I do always pick the healthiest and most low-cal option)",

Homemade mashed potatoes are never as good as restaurant because no self-respecting stay at home mom would ever think to use a ratio of 1:1 butter:potatoes. I\u2019ve read that in many (if not all) fast food franchises, they deliberately add a shit-ton more sour cream, butter, etc. to their recipes, so their calorie counts listed are off by hundreds probably. \n\nSometimes I hate going out to eat. (It\u2019s a fun \u201ccheat meal\u201d though so I mostly like it even if I do always pick the healthiest and most low-cal option)",
