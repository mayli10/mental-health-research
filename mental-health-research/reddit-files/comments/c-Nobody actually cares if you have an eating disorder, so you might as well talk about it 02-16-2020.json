If I were at a healthy bmi it would be a red flag. But I'm a fat bitch so as long as it makes me skinny...no one cares how much it may harm me in the process. \n\nBut whatever...I don't care about the harm either as long as I get skinny.

Ive actually made a conscious effort to heal myself within the last year and yeah, I reluctantly admit that I\u2019m at a healthy weight. \n\nBut for some damn reason, family members and male friends feel the need to make comments about me gaining weight (\u201coh the weight looks good on you\u201d \u201cyou were too skinny before, girls with a little extra meat look better\u201d \u201cyou look good but maybe you should try hitting the gym?\u201d) and it fucking enrages me. Who the fuck makes comments like that thinking it would be a compliment? All I can say to shut them up is \u201cyeah thanks, it\u2019s probably because I don\u2019t throw up after I eat or starve myself anymore\u201d. No shame.\n\nNO I\u2019m definitely not happy with my body, YES I still fight my disordered thoughts constantly and try to force myself to be ok with it by telling myself \u201cat least I\u2019m not hurting myself anymore\u201d. \n\nOh you wanna comment on my body and show concern for my health now that I\u2019m actually taking care of myself and not a dainty ass twig?

He already knew, but didn't think that I needed help for it, even though it effects my work and lunch breaks and I'm coming to work the day after I faint and not having the strength to stand all day...\n\nWhen my insurance comes through, I'm going to a clinic. Maybe people will know it's a serious problem then? But I don't know. Having an eating disorder that people know about, AND being very underweight isn't enough for people to care. Roommate keeps telling me about various other skinny people they've known that eat a lot and their BMI still says they're unhealthy even though they eat bla bla bla and it's like. Yeah, but I DON'T eat. Fuck, listen to me???\n\nNobody cares.\n\nNobody cares unless they are also trying to win against their own ED, or if they're that level of close to you that they see it's an actual problem, but even then, good luck.",

I'll never understand why people feel like they have the right to talk about other peoples' personal issues without even knowing the truth about the situation.",

Passive aggressive? Maybe, but if they don\u2019t care about being insensitive because they\u2019re projecting, then I won\u2019t either. \n\n\nCo worker: that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to eat?\n\nMe: you\u2019re going to eat ALL that?\n\nThey either shut up, think it\u2019s funny, or defend themselves saying, \u201cwell you\u2019re so skinny.\u201d Nope.\n\nOr,\n\nCo worker: I never see you eat \n\nUsually I would defend myself and try to explain that I had a big breakfast, or am saving for dinner, etc.\nBut this time I was SO fucking over hearing this for the 5th time!\n\nMe: haha, yeah I need your big appetite \n\nThey also found it funny.. either funny, or just uncomfortably laughing to be polite.

                "Text": "That coworker should really respect boundaries, proud of you for standing up to her! I hope that she will learn to shut her mouth :/\n\n And this is such a true post. I've had a binge eating disorder for a year now, I was able to stop myself before, but this last year it finally happened. But still, anytime I binge on candy, chips, donuts, which I asked my mother not to buy me because I genuinly can't stop, she just judges me for eating it so fast. Yesterday she told me ''I don't mind if you have binging or whatever it's called, but you have to start controlling it yourself, just do it''. I suffer from other mental health issues aswell, and she knows how hard I'm trying to eat healthier and control myself. It's honestly sad that people don't take ED seriously, and just think the person is someone incapable of controlling themselves, when it's much more then that. I used to think the same aswell, until I actually ended up getting one myself after years of struggling with my weight and body image, and now I know that there is a CLEAR difference. Atleast my mother and sister to TRY to understand, but just end up saying hurtful stuff and not understanding it in the end.",
