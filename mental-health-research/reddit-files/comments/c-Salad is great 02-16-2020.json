I just love the variety between every bite, unlike something that's carby and cheesy and meaty (which tastes great, but is pretty 1 note). I also love that salads actually LAST while you eat them, it's not just 2 bites and it's over. I think more people should eat salads regularly with some protein and dank dressings that aren't over the top.",
