It\u2019s also why I\u2019m not very credulous of any nutrition related study that based itself on the CDC\u2019s annual survey (the NHANES) where people are asked to report what they ate the previous day.

I feel like a pig because I can list every single thing I've eaten down to the gram (lol) meanwhile my boyfriend will say \"I haven't really eaten anything today\" and it triggers the fuck out of me. Meanwhile I KNOW for him, \"not eating anything\" means he had breakfast + coffee before work, didn't eat lunch on his break, or had like half his lunch if he didn't like it, and now he's hungry and justifying ordering pizza/mcdonalds. \n\nHe's also so bad at guessing calories in stuff, he'll be like \"babe that salad is like maybe 300 cals\" and me, weighing and tracking everything, is like \"lol try 600\". \n\nTLDR; people are awful at knowing the amount of food they eat bc they don't obsessively track every gram",

I knew so many people in college like that and theyd just have coffees and energy drinks for breakfast and a small snack around lunch time. and then get large things of mcdonalds or chinese takeaway or pizza for dinner. Its a drastic difference how people who eat normally and talk like that ACTUALLY eat when they arent geared towards restriction just bad habits. Remember a lot of girls like to talk this way because seeming like you havent eaten is like a weird form of social clout for some people especially women expected to stay thin.",
