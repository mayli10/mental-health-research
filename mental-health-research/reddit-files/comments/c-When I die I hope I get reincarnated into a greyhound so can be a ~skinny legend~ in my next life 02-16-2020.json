                    "Text": "Greyhounds are meant to be that size. On most mammals, the rib cage should be at least slightly visable. They're also bent over all day every day of their lives which make their spine and ribs much more prominent. \n\n\nCrawl on all fours and youd look similar, minus the stomach and legs, but that's only because you havent been specifically bread to be aerodynamic, athletic, and therefore as thin as possible while still being healthy. It's the same reason birds have hollow bones and planes dont carry unnecessary items- the less weight and counter thrust the faster they can go while using less energy. That's what GH were bread for speed. \n\n Athletes are thin for the same reason, it isnt starving its achieving peak physical performance by reducing excess weight, replacing as much fat with muscle as they can healthy, and streamlining their bodies. Cyclists will even shave their bodies to reduce air drag. Runners will cut fat and bulk muscle because its clearly harder to sprint with 30 excess lbs of pure fat, rather than 10 of essential muscle that will actually enhance their performance.\n\n\nDogs should also not be used as an argument against human body presentations. I'm not sure if that was anecdotal but I dont convince myself I have to eat nutritionally enhanced dog food to be healthy just because my dog does. Nor do I convince myself my dog needs my food just because it is what my body needs.",
