(up to 36* in summer)\n\nNow though I rarely have my window open and even have my radiator on, even at 12 degrees I have to curl up under several layers of quilts, blankets and dressing gowns to not hurt with pain and sometimes it\u2019s still really cold. >_<\n\nI actually turned my old PC (which has serious overheating issues) to get some files off of it the other day and I found myself putting my hands near it\u2019s CPU fan to get the hot air blown onto them, and it was really nice.\n\nLuckily for me I\u2019m only 6 months into my ED and I\u2019m still super fat so I don\u2019t feel proper cold like a someone with a real ED does.
