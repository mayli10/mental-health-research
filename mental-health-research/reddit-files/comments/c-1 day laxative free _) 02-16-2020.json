I used to take laxatives after every meal, didn\u2019t matter how little I ate, I had to take them. it was so bad at one point where I remember spraying a little whip cream in my mouth at my little brothers birthday and panicking in the bathroom for an hour because I forgot to bring laxatives with me to the party. \n\nAll the times of needing to run to the bathroom during classes or needing to pull over my car 6 times on the way home after the laxatives had kicked in while driving.",
