                "Text": "I\u2019m recovered from anorexia. \n\nFirst, my anorexia turned into bulimia. I tried to eat healthy and purged. This went on for a while, but slowly I stopped purging as much.\n\nThen I stopped throwing up as much and started running. The weight came on during this time and I got to a healthy weight (on paper - I didn\u2019t like it). Then the running got out of control. 20+ miles a day, tons of classes, stationary bike, etc. \n\nOne month ago I checked into treatment for overexercise and bulimia. It was hard seeing others who look like I used to before I restored. It was hard being the normal weight person. It was hard eating those meals. It\u2019s been hard not exercising. I had to grit my teeth and just do it. You know what\u2019s harder though? Being in the thick of the disorder. That hopeless feeling that you\u2019ll never escape. The endless back and forth between wanting recovery and wanting to be sick.\n\nFor the first time in my 25 years with this disease, I feel like I can do it. I have another month of intensive outpatient and years of regular outpatient ahead of me. I had to finally admit that I couldn\u2019t fix this on my own and that asking for help was the bravest thing I\u2019d ever done. And, I only gained 1 pound in treatment despite not running 100+ miles a week. I actually have a metabolism again after eating regular meals and I\u2019m not starving and binging. I had to see it to believe it.\n\nIf you want out - you can get out - but you have to let the professionals help.",

Im going on ~2 years of non-disordered life and it\u2019s good stuff. Whether you believe in full recovery or a more remission-like concept of sustained behavior modification (ie not acting on symptoms even if you still have the thoughts/urges, or not even having the thoughts/urges regularly but knowing relapse is always a risk in stressful times). There are a lot of experiences on all ends of the recovery spectrum and I\u2019m sure the experience differs greatly depending on when you first got sick, how long it\u2019s been etc...\nidk I just get bummed when I see someone writing it off as a possibility, sorry if this felt preachy or dismissive.",

                "Text": "\ud83d\udea9TW: NUMBERS. To all that are healing from anorexia: I went through recovery, went from 65lbs to 165lbs over the course of two years (I am 5'3\"). At first, feeding my body felt unnatural and I had to force myself to do it, but eventually my body and mind worked in unison to refeed and nourish, and my appetite returned - with a vengeance! (Hence the 100lb weight gain). Eventually, my appetite normalized and after 5 years my body has finally returned to a healthy weight (125-130lbs). According to my nutritionist, this intense weight gain and an ultimate return to a normal weight is typical for those recovering from anorexia.\n\nThe road is long and hard, and bulimia and the temptation of relapse were definitely there, especially in the beginning. But changing your mindset for the betterment of YOUR life, YOUR future, is absolutely possible and so very vital. Much love to all of you. Life IS beautiful...Hugs to all...you've got this!!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",

It's hard not to need to compensate for the food you eat, but it's all temporary. I hope you have a support system for this hard time \ud83c\udf1f I'm wishing you nothing but strength \u2665",
