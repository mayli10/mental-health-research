A pound may equal 3,500 calories, but your body physically cannot convert all the calories you consume into fat. Sure, its easier for some foods like pure sugar, but itll take waay longer for your stomach to completly digest yogurt or eggs rather than a candy bar; and by then most of that food will have become waste. Most american gain weight eother through small calorie increases (400 extra calories over several years) or by repeated binging of foods with high bioavailability, like sugar or fat. So if you do gotta binge, ignoring calories it might be best to consume whole, raw foods since cooking makes the calories in food easier to absorb\n\n\nIm still a fatass tho lmao",
