I know this is kind of common knowledge but I notice that if I go into the next day thinking I can\u2019t eat bc I binged it just makes me want to binge for more days which reinforces the cycle. Normally, giving myself permission to eat the next day makes sure I don\u2019t binge again which is my priority.\n\n\nUpdate:nvm it\u2019s probably another binge day strap in folks",
