                "Text": "Yeah.  TBH the best way out of this that I have found over my 20-year battle with EDNOS -- eat \"normal\" for a few months.  Seriously (yes, you'll probably gain, but you're already unhappy, so what's another few pounds?).  Then, restrict SLOWLY.  Talking .25-.5 lb weight-loss per week.  The trick is to stop the binging and for that, your body needs to realize that it's not starving.  Takes some time unfortunately.  Restrict too hard and fast, and you're back in the binge-restrict cycle. Alternatively, you can try eating consistently throughout the day.  Three meals and three snacks a day can do wonders.",

Viewing my most recent attempt as something sustianable I want to do in the longterm has helped me come back from my binges as opposed to just giving up and going back to over-eating.  \nWhat I meant was more about snapping out of a binge cycle, like OP mentioned in the title; when I do binge and freak out, especially after restricting, it's hard for me to talk myself down from that initial need to overeat as compensation for restricting, and it's hard to talk myself down from getting the foods I know will be binge triggers. But if I remind myself \"Oh, I don't want to gain more weight before [x] event,\" then I can usually talk myself down in the short term. And then, after a couple of days of non-binging, I find that it's easier just to maintain willpower and say no without needing to hold myself to anything.\n\nI agree with you though, I think finally learning that just because I stumble at times doesn't mean I should give up completely is what's made my most recent attempt at weightloss actually work.",
