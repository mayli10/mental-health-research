In general I've found that allowing myself a really bad binge for maybe a couple of days and just focusing on thinking about it rationally and acknowledging it's happening gets it \"out of my system\" faster than if I just try to ignore it or force myself out of it. I'll have a couple of days of out of control eating, as opposed to a few weeks of mini binge/restrict cycles. Like you, I find it easier to regain control during a binge if I acknowledge that it's happening, continue to track my calories no matter how much I eat, etc.",
