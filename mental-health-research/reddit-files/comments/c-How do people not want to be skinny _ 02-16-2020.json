People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you. But i'mma shoot straight with you here - that was her ED talking. ",

An ex of mine would totally forget to eat because of ADHD - then he would go slam 2k worth of cals in Taco Bell, and it would even out. \n\nIsn't your comment just like saying \"there are some people who just really like foods and are very interested in foods, or who have a large appetite and don't get full unless they eat excessive amount of food\" but at the other end of the spectrum? Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

I know this because, without an ED, it's not \"easier said than done\" to gain weight; it IS very easily done. She could just eat a little more, or choose higher-calories foods. \n\nThis \"I wish I wasn't so skinny\" narrative is how people hide EDs once they become visibly underweight and unwilling to attempt recovery - they act like it's not due to their intentional under-eating that they are underweight, but that's no more logical than a fat person saying \"I never eat much but I can't lose weight!\" - it's visibly untrue, physics apply to skinny people and fat people alike.

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you. But i'mma shoot straight with you here - that was her ED talking. ",

Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight.

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you.

An ex of mine would totally forget to eat because of ADHD - then he would go slam 2k worth of cals in Taco Bell, and it would even out. \n\nIsn't your comment just like saying \"there are some people who just really like foods and are very interested in foods, or who have a large appetite and don't get full unless they eat excessive amount of food\" but at the other end of the spectrum? Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you.

An ex of mine would totally forget to eat because of ADHD - then he would go slam 2k worth of cals in Taco Bell, and it would even out. \n\nIsn't your comment just like saying \"there are some people who just really like foods and are very interested in foods, or who have a large appetite and don't get full unless they eat excessive amount of food\" but at the other end of the spectrum? Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you. But i'mma shoot straight with you here - that was her ED talking. ",

If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight.

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you. But i'mma shoot straight with you here - that was her ED talking. ",

Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight.

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

I haven\u2019t stopped losing weight but I\u2019ve slowed it a ton and I see that as a big accomplishment. Just being able to put 1/4 teaspoon of sugar in my coffee in the morning is an accomplishment. Or being able to have a cocktail on the weekend, or a piece of toast with my eggs. A few months ago, I was so scared of carbs I would stand in the kitchen and cry. \n\nBut then as soon as the ugly symptoms of my ED stick around for a few days I get in big trouble with my loved ones all over again.

This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic.

An ex of mine would totally forget to eat because of ADHD - then he would go slam 2k worth of cals in Taco Bell, and it would even out. \n\nIsn't your comment just like saying \"there are some people who just really like foods and are very interested in foods, or who have a large appetite and don't get full unless they eat excessive amount of food\" but at the other end of the spectrum? Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you.

These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you. But i'mma shoot straight with you here - that was her ED talking. ",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

I haven\u2019t stopped losing weight but I\u2019ve slowed it a ton and I see that as a big accomplishment. Just being able to put 1/4 teaspoon of sugar in my coffee in the morning is an accomplishment. Or being able to have a cocktail on the weekend, or a piece of toast with my eggs. A few months ago, I was so scared of carbs I would stand in the kitchen and cry. \n\nBut then as soon as the ugly symptoms of my ED stick around for a few days I get in big trouble with my loved ones all over again.

I know this because, without an ED, it's not \"easier said than done\" to gain weight; it IS very easily done. She could just eat a little more, or choose higher-calories foods. \n\nThis \"I wish I wasn't so skinny\" narrative is how people hide EDs once they become visibly underweight and unwilling to attempt recovery - they act like it's not due to their intentional under-eating that they are underweight, but that's no more logical than a fat person saying \"I never eat much but I can't lose weight!\" - it's visibly untrue, physics apply to skinny people and fat people alike. It's \"easier said than done\" for her because she's unwilling to consume more calories despite wishing she weren't underweight - which is one form of ED.",

This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic.

An ex of mine would totally forget to eat because of ADHD - then he would go slam 2k worth of cals in Taco Bell, and it would even out. \n\nIsn't your comment just like saying \"there are some people who just really like foods and are very interested in foods, or who have a large appetite and don't get full unless they eat excessive amount of food\" but at the other end of the spectrum? Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you.

An ex of mine would totally forget to eat because of ADHD - then he would go slam 2k worth of cals in Taco Bell, and it would even out. \n\nIsn't your comment just like saying \"there are some people who just really like foods and are very interested in foods, or who have a large appetite and don't get full unless they eat excessive amount of food\" but at the other end of the spectrum? Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you.

If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight.

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

I haven\u2019t stopped losing weight but I\u2019ve slowed it a ton and I see that as a big accomplishment. Just being able to put 1/4 teaspoon of sugar in my coffee in the morning is an accomplishment. Or being able to have a cocktail on the weekend, or a piece of toast with my eggs. A few months ago, I was so scared of carbs I would stand in the kitchen and cry. \n\nBut then as soon as the ugly symptoms of my ED stick around for a few days I get in big trouble with my loved ones all over again.

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic. As a person who was likely loving and sympathetic towards her while you were together, I understand how you just accepted what she told you. But i'mma shoot straight with you here - that was her ED talking. ",

Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight.

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

I haven\u2019t stopped losing weight but I\u2019ve slowed it a ton and I see that as a big accomplishment. Just being able to put 1/4 teaspoon of sugar in my coffee in the morning is an accomplishment. Or being able to have a cocktail on the weekend, or a piece of toast with my eggs. A few months ago, I was so scared of carbs I would stand in the kitchen and cry. \n\nBut then as soon as the ugly symptoms of my ED stick around for a few days I get in big trouble with my loved ones all over again.

From my experience (I'm transgender, FtM) weight gain starts in the thighs, then lower stomach, then it goes wherever it wants.  \n\nThe thing is, you can't just choose where you want your weight to go (if that was possible I would throw sixty pounds off of me into the trash lmao).  \n\nA lot of people don't understand that since a lot of famous people have plastic surgery or implants to give them more of a figure.  The majority of the population does not look like that naturally, thus putting more pressure on people to have a flat stomach and a huge ass.  \n\nIt's weird.  I want to be skinny, but the people I tend to have crushes on are considered \"thicc.\"  But me?  Nah, I gotta be as skinny as possible.  And I know it isn't because I have to be the skinny one in the relationship, but.  I dunno, it has to do with how I was raised.",

This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic.

Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight.

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",

People who are unwilling to do so are considered to have a psychological blind spot regarding their own health hand food choices. I see no difference at the low end of the spectrum - society tells fat people \"suck it up and be hungry a little it won't kill you jeez -if you're so miserable at a deficit, learn to eat high-volume foods and time your eating to when you're hungriest\", and the same wisdom applies to your ex - she could have easily scheduled an extra bite of food here and there, added cream instead of milk in her coffee, had a pre-bedtime snack, just made more calorie-dense food choices, etc. she could have been a bit uncomfortable to get her weight up above where her fucking *immune system was faltering* - and failing to do so is ED behavior. full. stop.\n\nI say this as someone with friends and family with Crohn's disease - I get digestive issues, food intolerance, GI discomfort, etc. Mild discomfort infrequently in your day isn't an excuse for being underweight any more than it is for being overweight - it's the ED that rationalizes that narrative.\n\nUnderstand that everything you heard about her situation came thru her filter. This is an ED subreddit, we've heard all the excuses before. it's SO easy to eat just a bit more at 110 and gain, the discomfort she played up to you as physical was psychological (or physical BECAUSE of her disordered eating patterns). \n\nYou don't stay 110 and struggle not to lose without an ED, sorry. that's the EDlogic version of Fatlogic.

And then I\u2019ll be so indebted to them forever and prostrate myself at their feet in gratitude \ud83d\udc4d And when we don\u2019t follow they script in their heads, we\u2019re not playing nice and are just assholes who deserve our misery lol.

An ex of mine would totally forget to eat because of ADHD - then he would go slam 2k worth of cals in Taco Bell, and it would even out. \n\nIsn't your comment just like saying \"there are some people who just really like foods and are very interested in foods, or who have a large appetite and don't get full unless they eat excessive amount of food\" but at the other end of the spectrum? Isn't the perennial response to that type of comment \"then those people need to get their shit together, eat a correct amount and not to excess, learn some discipline, learn some routine, and get their weight in a healthy range\"? Wouldn't the advice be identical for someone at a too-low weight? ok, so you \"forget to eat\" - set a fucking timer. These are just excuses - I know because I lived these excuses - both of them - at various points in my life. \n\nIf your weight is unhealthily high, society expects you to get your shit together, and it's seen as a psychological-problem-to-moral-failing if you can't. If your weight is unhealthily low, and you *can't* or *won't* get your shit together and eat enough to bring you into a healthy range, I don't see how that isn't an ED. \"teehee I just forget to eat!\" is no more valid than a fat person saying \"teehee I just forget to stop eating!\" \n\nI accept that there is likely a small number of people for whom completely ignoring their intake and \"eating intuitively\" leads to a healthy weight. But I think that is likely a small minority of the people who are actually a low weight/underweight, at least in America and other countries with obesity problems.",

Very few people have a life that naturally exposes them to healthy foods and a good amount of exercise. Office jobs, holidays, \"treats\" at work, it's all a culture that trends towards a sedentary lifestyle and an overindulgent diet. Orthorexia, frankly, is the best a person can do in America. There's very little room, psychologically speaking, to just passively get enough exercise and eat enough vegetables and not eat too many calories. That's a literal luxury that rich people buy for themselves.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible this person used to be overweight, lost their weight thru a very repetitive eating habit of \"safe\" foods (e.g. salad for lunch, the same amount and type every day), and is freaking out that she doesn't have her normal meal and has anxiety over deviating from her routine.\n\nThat's still ED AF. But it could be from a very real fear of \"going back to being fat\" because of having not learned how to eat on the fly in moderation. I know people with BED who \"have it under control\", sometimes it's easier/lower risk to not eat at all if they don't have access to the foods that don't trigger a binge - because a reasonable 400 calorie lunch easily turns into a 10k day, which can then persist for weeks/months. All because of a forgotten salad :(\n\nBased on the fact you said it's been a change over months, it (unfortunately) sounds like ED behavior manifesting or rubbing off onto her from others. Do y'all go to the guidance counselor for lunch because of ED and being monitored to \"ensure you eat\"? That environment can be SUPER triggering...",
