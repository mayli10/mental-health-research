                "Text": "I went to a Friendsgiving last night and I restricted for a week straight so I could have a good meal and eat whatever I wanted since this would be my only really thanksgiving because my parents are traveling. Instead I just stressed about the food and filled my plate half with salad with no dressing and had a bite of every other thing I plated.\n\nIt\u2019s like I worked so hard to hit this particular GW so why waste all my hard work now? I did however take home a piece of pumpkin pie and got stoned and ate that shit up because im not gunna eat pumpkin pie till next year lol. All the other stuff I can make on my own.\n\nEDs rule!!!",
