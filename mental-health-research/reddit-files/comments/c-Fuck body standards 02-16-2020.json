                "Text": "I will never stop quoting Tina Fey when it comes to modern beauty standards \n\n\n\"But I think the first real change in women\u2019s body image came when JLo turned it butt-style. That was the first time that having a large-scale situation in the back was part of mainstream American beauty. Girls wanted butts now. Men were free to admit that they had always enjoyed them. And then, what felt like moments later, boom\u2014Beyonc\u00e9 brought the leg meat. A back porch and thick muscular legs were now widely admired. And from that day forward, women embraced their diversity and realized that all shapes and sizes are beautiful. Ah ha ha. No. I\u2019m totally messing with you. All Beyonce and JLo have done is add to the laundry list of attributes women must have to qualify as beautiful. Now every girl is expected to have Caucasian blue eyes, full Spanish lips, a classic button nose, hairless Asian skin with a California tan, a Jamaican dance hall ass, long Swedish legs, small Japanese feet, the abs of a lesbian gym owner, the hips of a nine-year-old boy, the arms of Michelle Obama, and doll tits. The person closest to actually achieving this look is Kim Kardashian, who, as we know, was made by Russian scientists to sabotage our athletes.\"",

Rather than just people over a certain size, it's now alienating nearly everyone.\n\nIt's nice we're appreciating larger people, but I wish it wasn't just this one single body type. I like bellies.",

Like it takes a fair amount of lying to yourself or skewed self perception or skewed cultural awareness to call yourself skinny if you're not, like we have a pretty solid and even to an extent objective definition of skinny, but it's a lot easier for people who aren't curvy/thick (in the way that it's generally meant) to call themselves such/identify themselves in that word because it's so much looser.\n\nLike if someone praises \"skinny\" most people are on the same page as to what that means and it's a pretty easy yes/no as to whether it's a category you fall into. But if someone says \"curvy\" or \"thick\" it's a lot easier for people who are not intentionally included in the sentiment to *consider* themselves included.\n\nDoes that make sense? Is that mean? Idk I think people like curvy better as a standard because it's a lot easier to convince yourself that you meet it when you don't.",
