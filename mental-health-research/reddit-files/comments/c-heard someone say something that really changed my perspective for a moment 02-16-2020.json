Her changes in weight were caused/exacerbated by changes in the medication she has to take for her chronic illness and pain, and she explained this was why she hated thinking of weight loss as inherently positive and hated people complimenting her on it like she'd done something worthy of praise when it was literally a complication of her lifelong illness.\n\nHer language about fitting into clothes also struck me even though it was just a throwaway line for her and stuck with me. She's so wonderful at presenting the issues that are important to her in a concise, empathetic, strong way without sounding defensive or combatative.",
