It is nearly impossible to look modelesque without restricting calories to an unhealthy degree.  I lived in Hawaii briefly and followed thin people\u2019s IG accounts from the island; while it looked like they were eating so much all the time, the calories they consumed per day were low.  \n\nHaving an iced coconut water or unsweetened coffee, a small fruit bowl or 1 slice of avo toast for breakfast, a salad with some nuts (or more fruit) on it for lunch, more fruit for a snack, and some tofu/tempeh with a side of roasted veggies for dinner comes out to less than 1000 calories per day.  Very few adults have TDEEs under that amount.  Combine that with an hour or more of exercise per day and you have a beautiful body that\u2019s pretty underweight.",
