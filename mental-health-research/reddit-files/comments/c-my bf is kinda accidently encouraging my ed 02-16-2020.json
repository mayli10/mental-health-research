He makes comments like, \"I want a mallet for your ribs.\" (Like to play them as a musical instrument) \n\nMy family makes inappropriate comments too, but they don't know about my ED. They suspect it but don't know for certain. My sister told me that she wanted to pick me up and put me in her pocket.\n\nED brain is like a drooling zombie for these remarks.",
