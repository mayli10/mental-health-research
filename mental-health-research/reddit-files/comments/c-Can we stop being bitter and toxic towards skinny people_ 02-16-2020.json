                            "Text": "You said there are genetic disorders which affect how fast or slow you consume energy. That's metabolism. Marfanoid\u2013progeroid\u2013lipodystrophy syndrome is an example. \nYou cant have a slow metabolism because you have to somehow produce energy to maintain your body weight while apparently eating too little to maintain it. Claiming to only eat 600 calories a day for a year and staying at 300 pounds is impossible. That breaks the laws of thermodynamics. \nYou can have fast because you can be bad at absorbing energy and just simply dispose too much. Its RARE but it can apply to some people which I dont want to exclude",

But the reality is that society treats skinny people way better than they treat fat people. That doesn't mean one is suffering more than the other by any means. But it does mean that there's a higher likelihood that one gets looked at more kindly by more of society than the other. Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person. But if I, as a person with a lower body fat percentage, were to complain about constantly being hungry, I'd probably be taken more seriously than someone who was overweight complaining about the same thing.",

Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person.

Claiming to only eat 600 calories a day for a year and staying at 300 pounds is impossible. That breaks the laws of thermodynamics. \nYou can have fast because you can be bad at absorbing energy and just simply dispose too much.

But the reality is that society treats skinny people way better than they treat fat people. That doesn't mean one is suffering more than the other by any means. But it does mean that there's a higher likelihood that one gets looked at more kindly by more of society than the other. Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person. But if I, as a person with a lower body fat percentage, were to complain about constantly being hungry, I'd probably be taken more seriously than someone who was overweight complaining about the same thing.",

But the reality is that society treats skinny people way better than they treat fat people. That doesn't mean one is suffering more than the other by any means. But it does mean that there's a higher likelihood that one gets looked at more kindly by more of society than the other. Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person. But if I, as a person with a lower body fat percentage, were to complain about constantly being hungry, I'd probably be taken more seriously than someone who was overweight complaining about the same thing.",

But theres also people who have small appetites or are picky eaters. It also depends on where you live too. In the US, its probably hard with big portions and fast food. Where i come from, the portions are typically half of western portions and sharing food is norm so i see quite a few naturally thin people",

But the reality is that society treats skinny people way better than they treat fat people. That doesn't mean one is suffering more than the other by any means. But it does mean that there's a higher likelihood that one gets looked at more kindly by more of society than the other. Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person. But if I, as a person with a lower body fat percentage, were to complain about constantly being hungry, I'd probably be taken more seriously than someone who was overweight complaining about the same thing.",

And you had to go out and make a blanket statement on how skinny people dont have it bad as fatter people. Like..what are you implying? That we shouldn't be nice to them? That literally helps nothing. The point was to stop projecting and indirectly being jealous. Your first two sentences contradicted each other AGAIN. You are literally not getting the point to be more empathetic. I'm done talking about this because I repeated myself several times which isnt going through your head.",

Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person.

Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person. But if I, as a person with a lower body fat percentage, were to complain about constantly being hungry, I'd probably be taken more seriously than someone who was overweight complaining about the same thing.",

It's so common to see posts here insisting fasting is disordered, everyone on 1200/1500/dieting subs etc must have an ED, mocking posts on their subs or complaining they're triggering when imo it's disrespectful of us to invade their safe spaces and complain our EDs make their threads upsetting when there are whole communities devoted to fasting/IF/veganism/etc nutrition related stuff that explicitly say they can't accommodate EDs and the forums aren't meant for us. Fasting is not inherently unhealthy, it can be religious, spiritual, lots of evidence to suggest it can even contribute positively to health. And many people on places like 1200isplenty are extremely unhealthy, have a lot of weight to lose, and are literally dying and suffering mentally from the opposite of a restrictive eating disorder. I hate seeing people here drag their whole forum claiming they're all disordered or that their community is unhealthy/unsupportive because their posts can be taken out of context and applied to a restrictive ED in a toxic manner.\n\nIdk if I'm explaining myself well but I'm scared to post stuff like this on here bc it seems to get mass downvoted nowadays if you don't go along w the fasting = disordered, dieting = thinly veiled anorexia, 1200isplenty = edanonymemes in disguise hivemind. Hate to say it but context does matter. Sure, you can take an overeating meme from a 1200 sub and post it on anonymemes and get upvotes/relatability from both communities but it's just not the same. An obese person who desperately needs to lose weight medically and is struggling to do so posting for support and \"tips\" from their weight loss community is simply not the same as the exact same post on this forum coming from an underweight person with AN. I think it's projecting to the max to say keto, IF, fasting, or any lifestyle with any thought to eating habits whatsoever *must* be eating disordered just because those of us with literal eating disorders may use those lifestyles or eating habits as part of our disorders.

I'm relatively slim with an athletic build, at a BMI just under 19, and people have commented about how I can seemingly eat a fuckton without gaining weight. This is because I binge/overeat massive amounts in front of other people, then don't eat again for 3-4 days while working out intensely for about 16 hours during that fast. It's not healthy, and I'm not \"lucky\" or have a \"fast metabolism\" and I can't \"eat whatever I want without gaining weight.\"\n\nTHAT BEING SAID. I completely understand why people complain about it or feel bitterness towards me for what they see as my behavior vs. my physique. I want to be skinnier of course, but to people who are at a higher weight or body fat than me, all they see is the skinny girl who eats ten thousand calories at once without gaining weight. They see someone with a magic metabolism eating whatever I want and maintaining it effortlessly. They see someone with a more ideal body that society deems attractive, compared to them, if they're overweight. Yes, it sucks that they don't see how much I'm actually struggling. But let's not pretend like we'd rather be overweight with the same amount of mental struggles. I'd rather be struggling this much at my current weight than at the weight that the people I'm thinking about are currently at. Anyone would. And it's disingenuous to pretend otherwise. \n\nThin privilege absolutely exists. It's partially why we strive for thinness, if we're being absolutely honest with ourselves. So I don't get upset over people who feel bitter about my weight compared to theirs. Because in their eyes, and even my own comparatively, at least my struggle gets me a more desired result than their struggle.\n\nAnd let's be completely honest. You would ten million times rather be shamed for being skinny than for being fat. Sure, there may be some people who don't want to be super underweight. But NO ONE wants to be obese. There's far more stigma to being overweight than being underweight. It's honestly super annoying, and I really hate when people on subs like fatlogic pretend like being shamed for being skinny is the same as being shamed for being fat.

But the reality is that society treats skinny people way better than they treat fat people. That doesn't mean one is suffering more than the other by any means. But it does mean that there's a higher likelihood that one gets looked at more kindly by more of society than the other. Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person. But if I, as a person with a lower body fat percentage, were to complain about constantly being hungry, I'd probably be taken more seriously than someone who was overweight complaining about the same thing.",

Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight.

That breaks the laws of thermodynamics. \nYou can have fast because you can be bad at absorbing energy and just simply dispose too much.

Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person.

They are uneducated about the risks\n\n\"Naturally thin\" gets abused- out of self-defence- there's nothing natural about being.. when it gets into weight loss territory that is seriously abnormal and disordered from a health perspective\n\nI worry about people who were like me before society's obsession with being thin screwed them up and the messages they're getting- who were just normal, athletic\n\nWith some insecurities that were accelerated and influenced through people defending themselves against thin shaming- it probably had nothing to do with them but they get dragged into it\n\nCarrying on and on past underweight and past emaciated with a lot of illusions around it- thanks the right wing conservatives. Their denial of being thin and inability to accept it is so deranged. They're like Jehovah's Witness. They've got really dry personalities and they want to be like Nicole Richie and they judge people for looking at magazines\n\nThey make decisions about people who are supported financially for having mental illnesses, and they're influencing perceptions of the unemployed and people with eating disorders\n\nTheir idiocy is invalidating towards people with eating disorders who can't get help- they think because they can do it, everyone else should, and they're very judgemental- if you died from your ED, they'd say it was natural causes and cover it up\n\nThey think anorexia is a myth, no one is anorexic, and if you think you had it years ago you were just obsessed with mental illness documentaries and you needed to get a life/get a job- they're in Parliament deciding who gets money/support, etc\n\nIt has some role in maintaining the status quo, the extreme denial of it. I don't think you should have to make a public statement about why you are whatever you are, or justify it, or pretend you're doing something you're not\n\nI think there are social pressures to justify it and explain yourself and take a side, and you don't have to do that- to cover up or whatever\n\nI think people freak out and think something is going to happen if they don't. I think it plays a minimal role in why people get together and stay together, when any types of relationships are committed",

Marfanoid\u2013progeroid\u2013lipodystrophy syndrome is an example. \nYou cant have a slow metabolism because you have to somehow produce energy to maintain your body weight while apparently eating too little to maintain it. Claiming to only eat 600 calories a day for a year and staying at 300 pounds is impossible. That breaks the laws of thermodynamics. \nYou can have fast because you can be bad at absorbing energy and just simply dispose too much.

But the reality is that society treats skinny people way better than they treat fat people. That doesn't mean one is suffering more than the other by any means. But it does mean that there's a higher likelihood that one gets looked at more kindly by more of society than the other. Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person. But if I, as a person with a lower body fat percentage, were to complain about constantly being hungry, I'd probably be taken more seriously than someone who was overweight complaining about the same thing.",

Being skinny doesn't mean your life is easy by any means or even that it's easier than someone who's overweight. But it does mean that you're less likely to be as negatively viewed by other people purely for your weight than someone who's overweight. I'm not saying this is going to happen automatically for every skinny person.

And you had to go out and make a blanket statement on how skinny people dont have it bad as fatter people. Like..what are you implying? That we shouldn't be nice to them? That literally helps nothing. The point was to stop projecting and indirectly being jealous. Your first two sentences contradicted each other AGAIN. You are literally not getting the point to be more empathetic. I'm done talking about this because I repeated myself several times which isnt going through your head.",
