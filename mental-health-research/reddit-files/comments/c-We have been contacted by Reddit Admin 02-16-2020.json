Going private doesn't hide us from them.  I think the best thing is to understand optics are *extremely* important right now and to recognize that our long term viability is dependent on us to make sure we make it clear we are not promoting EDs. I know it sucks that we aren't understood. This is not becoming a recovery subreddit either.  But if we want to be left alone, we have to play by their rules. ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible.

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

It basically just said not to have anything problematic like a rule discouraging seeking treatment and that they wanted us to have the recovery info front and center.  We have to be aware of how we are perceived right now. I understand the concern. We are not going to tell you how to live your life and we plan mainly to be a subreddit to commiserate. Most people here don't need 'tips' anyway.  In my personal experience, most of proED was just pure support and we will maintain that. I welcome any input about things you are scared will be eliminated so that we can address it.  ",

That only people actively looking for recovery are going to feel like they can share their struggles here. \n\nAs an example I just saw a post saying that we should not call weight loss \"progress\" because it's the result of a disease and I think almost everyone on here on a rational level can agree with that. But the reality of this disease is that we do see weight loss as progress and not beeing able to share that sentiment because it can be seen as \"glamourising\" EDs just feels a bit wrong to me. \n\nI hope I'm proven though and that this place can feel just as safe and welcoming as proED did. \n\nAlso I love that reddit is only providing american resources\ud83d\ude43 If you're in Denmark and looking for help, you can contact Landsforeningen mod spiseforstyrelser og selvskade:+4570101818, or make an appointment with your GP to get a referal to a psychiatrist or therapist. \n\n&#x200B;",

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible.

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

I totally agree that it is a hard line to walk... you don't want people to be encouraging people to harm themselves, but you also need to allow people to talk about some hard things.

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible.

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

I was basically just another r/proED user who happened to become a mod of this sub due to my frequent shitposting on the old one. I am just trying to figure out how to maintain a community that has helped literally thousands of people in pain and keep it from disappearing. For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment. We are just going to do our best to be vigilant about the 'culture' we are creating.  ",

For what it's worth, proED helped me stop purging several times a day. I am now below the diagnostic threshold for bulimia. I am currently restricting but trying to do so while maintaining my health as much as possible. To assuage any fears, this isn't becoming a recovery sub although I want to encourage the people who want that to seek it. None of the mods are in recovery at the moment.

But I don't think too much is lost from removing that though.\n\nWhat I think was very lost from just straight up banning was\n\n1) people in the depths of this disorder are going to search \"proed\" and not finding such a harm reduction focused, supportive community that /r/proed was is going to HURT people\n\n2) these discussions about how to reduce enabling problematic things could have been done by an open dialogue before banning, and 32,000 people suffering were not given that opportunity",
