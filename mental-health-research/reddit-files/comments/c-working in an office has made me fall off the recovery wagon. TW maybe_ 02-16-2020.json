                "Text": "Ugh, this makes me so sad for you considering I have been in your position. About 5 years ago and the beginning of my ED, I became a nutritional therapist and weight loss coach. HA! go figure I was helping clients with EDs and healthy weightloss, meanwhile hiding my bulimia and BED. Anyway, I worked in a medical office with a lot of women/nurse assistants, office clerks, etc...and they were always doing the next best diet and constantly making remarks toward me about how thin I was..I guess they considered them compliments, but I didn't.  They patronized me when I didn't take part in the donuts in the break room. After about 2 years there, I realized that it was absolutley not healthy for me and my recovery. None of them knew about my struggles and I know if I had told them, things would be different. But how would that make me look in my career ? I'd be a total hypocrite when I am preaching to clients of mine about living a healthy lifestyle, and \"having treats here and there won't hurt you\", or \"it's all about SELF LOVE\"...whilst I am practicing none of that and secretly taking laxatives, diet pills, binging/purging, etc...\n\nAt the end, I went to my boss who was the leading Doctor whom I worked under. He was the MOST understanding man ever and I explained to him what I was going through and why I felt working there wasnt good for me. He knew that I was great at my job, but he ultimately understood why I couldnt stay. I ended up leaving that career path behind me. I ralized the only reason I had any interest in nutrition, diet, weight loss coaching was because of MY eating disorder. Right around the time my ED started, was when I randomly decided to go to school for nutritional therapy.\n\nAnyywaayyy, not to go on a rant about myself, honestly I would suggest talking to someone. Maybe if you feel comfortable enough with anyone you work with. Ive realized that it's best to give people the benefit of the doubt. Everyone has struggles, so maybe if you opened up to one of them, they would be more understanding and it would definitely lift some weight off your shoulders.\n\nAt my new job I have even casually pointed out that I struggled with ED in the past(still currently struggling hoenstly ) and all of my co workers were very sweet about it. They didn't make a big deal out of it.  some of them  even mentioned they struggled with other diseases like depression,anxiety. And now everyone I work with knows not to question me about food or diets or why I am the only one who brings my food to work (I work at a restaurant so everyone usually orders their food there)",

                "Text": "TW: numbers, fasting, etc. \nI think working in an office, especially one that does weight loss competitions is extremely triggering for someone with an ED. \nlast year, before I even knew I had an ED (or maybe was just denying it like I am now) I was working in an office and one of the first things my coworkers said to me when i got hired was \u201cyou\u2019re going to put a lot of weight working here! all we do is sit all day!\u201d As someone who was already very cautious about my weight and actively losing weight, I took this as a challenge. I used being sedentary as an excuse to fast. I wouldn\u2019t eat for 3-5 days at a time sometimes. Walked the stairs and circled the buildings on my breaks for exercise. Had a strict rule where I wouldn\u2019t eat at work at all, despite the constant offer for free food. Bitchy comments 24/7. It was a mess. \nThere was also always a \u201cbiggest loser\u201d competition that lasted 8 weeks with a 2-4 week break between each. I never did it because I didn\u2019t want to waste my money. May rolled around and I was determined to lose weight for summer. I joined. It was $50 to enter, 6 people did it so the winnings were at $300. No fucking way I\u2019m losing that. \nNeedless to say I lost 40 lbs in 2 months and won the competition. I quit a week later. \nNow that I sit back and think about it, I spent my entire time there in a really sick and dark place. And the office-lady-weight-loss culture really fueled me too. \n(I\u2019m in a better place now, I work a job where I\u2019m active so I allow myself to eat more, though it usually turns to binging and sometimes purging, but at least I can walk straight without seeing stars!!)",

                "Text": "I totally feel all of this!!! I can relate to an extent ... I honestly don\u2019t even think people even REALIZE how much their seemingly innocent comments can be such a trigger for our ED! Anytime I have ever fallen back into this (which has been about 3 or 4 times total after stopping for a good amount of time since my late teens/early 20\u2019s... I\u2019m 33 now) has been after either successfully losing weight from dang dieting and then starting to gain it back, or just having the fear of gaining it back... or from trying to diet and not losing enough... or sometimes just from sheer loneliness or sadness... stress and anxiety have me a nervous stomach as well so I hadn\u2019t been eating as much from time to time. I have been a healthy BMI, and I have also been considered \u201coverweight\u201d and \u201cbig-boned\u201d or \u201cchunky\u201d...   I am a healthy BMI now, but I have been 40 lbs more than I am now, fluctuated up and down over the years, mostly on purpose from dieting and then letting myself go, but it just sucks CONSTANTLY having food and weight on your mind! It\u2019s exhausting... \n\nStrangely enough, over the past 2 years I lost a lot of weight due to stress from divorce from my alcoholic husband, a sick mom, and then an abusive relationship (separate from the guy I divorced, this other abusive guy was a malignant narcissist, fucked with my brain in so many different ways it\u2019s unreal that I dealt with it for 7 to 10 months). Honestly these events had all caused me to have less appetite naturally and to think about other things instead of food, or just stress in general caused my body to metabolize faster, I have no idea... I did eat bad foods from time to time, but I balanced it out with good food... but I would stop eating when I was full, probably wouldn\u2019t eat much sometimes because of such high stress and nerves making me feel less hungry, etc... but in a weird way, I felt like I had a good and normal relationship with food for the first time in my life, oddly enough... because I wasn\u2019t obsessing over it for once in my life. I really have no idea why I hate to say this, but I have almost ENJOYED being so easily a healthy BMI with little effort or concern over food. I have never \u201ceasily\u201d been a healthy BMI. But in reality, the circumstances I was under have been some kind of different hell... I have had the hardest and busiest days of my dang life, non-ideal circumstances... but I am in \u201cthe best shape\u201d of my life from it. Which sucks! It\u2019s like if I\u2019m happy and want to eat, well there goes that, and then there starts the constant thoughts about food and what I\u2019m putting in my body, restricting, counting, binging, and uhh- purging, etc. ugh. \n\nAnd now back on subject related to your post, while People think I am so healthy and only eat healthy on the outside, they really have honestly NO IDEA that I\u2019m extremely unhealthy in reality, while in private... or I would eat extremely healthy while at work, because I would eat bad elsewhere, etc... but of course, all the comments like \u201cof course she doesn\u2019t want a cupcake\u201d or \u201cshe eats so healthy all the time, how do you do it\u201d blah blah blah... it\u2019s like shut up. They have no idea... but I have not consistently been where I am now ever until the past year or so, and hadn\u2019t seen this weight since I was 19 years old... I enjoy it. I want to stay this weight, which is a healthy weight and body frame, for once in my life... I\u2019m happy with my body, but to keep it is gonna be another story... And what really pissed me off recently, after I got out of my abusive situation 4 months ago, my Aunt and Uncle (who I love dearly) felt I looked \u201csickly\u201d (stress, duh!) and kept tell me to eat and put on some weight! Like it was them telling me that every other day for a few weeks, I was like wtf... finally I told my uncle, look... I am a healthy BMI... I have no plans on gaining any weight back, but I\u2019m going to work on getting healthy and happy in other ways (psychologically, I guess)... I probably look run down due to stress and unhappiness, nothing to do with my healthy weight... they were just used to seeing me a little heavier. It was just annoying hearing their comments... and for people to even give their two-cents about what anyone puts, or doesn\u2019t put, in their mouth... or if they think someone is \u201ctoo skinny\u201d so they need to eat. Skinny shaming sucks just as bad as fat shaming and I wish it just didn\u2019t exist. If they only KNEW what their comments do! Anyways people just need to mind their dang business!!! \n\nAnd to finish this off... well, now that I have had all this time to myself after breaking free from my situation elsewhere, and I\u2019ve obtained a less stressful lifestyle as far as relationships go... I have sadly went into a downward spiral with food again. I tried so hard not to, but it seemed to be inevitable. I started exercising a lot, because I needed a Healthy way to take out negative energy... but almost felt like it creeped up to excessive level on days I would exercise... then Friends come into town, this friend loves pizza and ice cream... and for some reason pizza was my trigger this time. And then it trickled into eating desserts again unhealthily... I ate pizza and desserts healthily prior to now during my issues the past couple years, but without the anxiety and stress causing me to have less appetite, my food issues have reared their ugly head yet again. And it was almost like I allowed myself to eat those things, and it opened up the dang flood gates. I wanted all the things again. And I\u2019m not sure if subconsciously the comments also have some effect as well... I am back at it myself. I hate it so much. It\u2019s almost worse every time I\u2019ve \u201crelapsed\u201d too... I am to the point again where I\u2019m trying to cut it out again, because I\u2019m pretty sure I have Gastroparesis (again... I had it back about 7 to 8 years ago)... but even then it\u2019s almost like I subconsciously restrict and know what I can have to keep down to a healthy weight. Just the constant thoughts about food and eating SUCK!!!! \n\nSorry this was long, but you\u2019re not alone!!!!",

I eat too much junk and even though I don't really want to lose, I want to cut  down on all that  because it just aint good for you!'. Pretend that you might not appear to eat it much, but 'it's a whole different story at the weekends or when I see my family'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not let their words touch you. Let it ping off you because honestly, and I mean this, they have forgotten about their stupid comments within seconds of saying those things. And also, as you've already alluded to - a lot of their bullshit is born from jealousy at what they perceive as your iron willpower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- and that's another thing you can say 'jokingly' - 'the more you try pressuring me to eat it, the more determined I am not too....game on, nice try!'",
