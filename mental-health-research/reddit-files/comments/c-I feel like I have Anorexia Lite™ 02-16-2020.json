Every Friday I give myself the \"privilege\" of not working out + eating \"a normal amount\" of foods I normally consider UNSAFE foods like cereal (mostly bc cereal is one of my top 3 binge foods...Ahahaaaahaha \\[laughs in 'you played yourself') or peanut butter pretzels or protein bars (another one of my top 3 binge foods) or Oreos. INEVITABLY it turns into a terrible binge session of empty carbs and sugars, which then means I have to fast + exercise a LOT the next day...and restrict again the week after...until FRIDAY...ugh. I could just allow myself to eat semi-normally and exercise less on my non-cheat days, but it literally feels impossible without my brain exploding from trying to calculate the calories + obsessing over how many miles on the treadmill that translates into :( \n\nMy brain. it's all bad.",

Every Friday I give myself the \"privilege\" of not working out + eating \"a normal amount\" of foods I normally consider UNSAFE foods like cereal (mostly bc cereal is one of my top 3 binge foods...Ahahaaaahaha \\[laughs in 'you played yourself') or peanut butter pretzels or protein bars (another one of my top 3 binge foods) or Oreos. INEVITABLY it turns into a terrible binge session of empty carbs and sugars, which then means I have to fast + exercise a LOT the next day...and restrict again the week after...until FRIDAY...ugh. I could just allow myself to eat semi-normally and exercise less on my non-cheat days, but it literally feels impossible without my brain exploding from trying to calculate the calories + obsessing over how many miles on the treadmill that translates into :( \n\nMy brain. it's all bad.",
