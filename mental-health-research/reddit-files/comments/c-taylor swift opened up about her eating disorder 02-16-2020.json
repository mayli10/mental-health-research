                "Text": "Oh geez, I remember a thread on Twitter where a bunch of girls were talking about something that happened at a concert for her rep tour\n\nA group of TS fanpage runners got together to go as a group and got VIP tickets. They all knew each other from running their pages but I guess some girl they didn't know that well tagged along with them. They were whatever about it until it got time to go backstage and meet Taylor and while they were all talking to her, this tag along girl blurted out \"Taylor! How'd you get so thicc!\" And I guess Taylor just looked at her like :\\ and got pretty embarrassed and kinda upset looking. The rest of the group was mortified and tried to apologize to her and she was like \"aha it's okay, I'm happy now that's how\" \n\nAnd in any case the girls ended up saying it was so awkward and upsetting and they were mad they let that extra girl tag along in the first place when no one really knew her.\n\nKnowing that she had an ED before now suddenly makes this story 1000% worse.",

But I just hated myself (disproportionately more than other triggers) because I ALWAYS saw her in the context of a super shallow pop song or VS runway models like OMG she is sooo coool and has model friends and gives gifts to her fans. Her early financial help and success always hurt, my family struggled.\n\nI wanted to be so jealous and hateful because seeing her beauty made me hate myself. I'm brown, I have blemishes. I'm fat. I had no social life. I'm short. She was just so long, skinny, golden, glowing, lean. She presented that way. It just felt so unfair to teenage me.\n\nIt's so sad, I can't be mad at her reading this. She was a victim of it just as much. So now I have all this unresolved anger about all my past pain, because she said and did and engaged in things that made me feel awful but it wasn't her fault.\n\nFuck celebrity culture and fuck the male gaze that is unabashedly subscribed to, and is internalized by some women who propagate that shit even worse.\n\nThis is heartbreaking and I'm happy she's speaking up about it. It's hard to be a role model about this stuff if you haven't resolved it yourself. It takes so much courage to be in your own body and accept it regardless of what people say.",

Because I'm so sad for her but I still don't like certain things she chose to do. But IDC - I understand why she was the way she was and I respect her integrity now. I feel a lot calmer about it.
