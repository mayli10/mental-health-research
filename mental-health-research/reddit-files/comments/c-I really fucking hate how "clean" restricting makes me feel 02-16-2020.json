                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                            "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

                        "Text": "Here\u2019s what I did: every other day, add 100 calories to your 800. Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you\u2019re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day. \n\nIt\u2019s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I\u2019ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it\u2019s no longer difficult. I\u2019m planning to go up to 1200. \n\nOne issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn\u2019t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).\n\nSo yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal. Obviously I\u2019m still sick, but I\u2019m getting more nourishment which is a big step\n\nOh and another thing\u2014are you a volume eater or so you prefer small meals? The majority of time with my ED I\u2019ve eaten one meal a day. This was too difficult for me when increasing calories. I find it much easier to eat 2-3 smaller meals a day",

I\u2019ve been struggling with Ana (with bouts of purging when I\u2019m forced to eat in social situations) since I was 10 years old. I\u2019m 37 now. My rational brain knows that\u2019s Its ok to be full sometimes and I\u2019ve been through enough treatment/therapy to know what tools I should use to resist purging or restricting. \n\nBUT DAMN if being empty for days at a time doesn\u2019t feel amazing. I\u2019ve tried to explain this to friends that don\u2019t struggle with EDs in the past and I always just come across sounding crazy and vain. It\u2019s an addiction, a high, a euphoria, and a sense of pride and accomplishment that I\u2019ve yet to match with any other successes I\u2019ve had in life. \nThat being said, i know it sucks that I\u2019ve felt this way for almost 30 years without ever being able to stick to recovery. But I don\u2019t want to stop. I never have and that scares me if I let myself think about it. So I know my comment glorifies this feeling, but fast forward your brain to 20 years from now... do you really want to be like me and put my sickness before anything else in life for this long?  Thank you for letting me vent that, I needed to put these words out there tonight.",
