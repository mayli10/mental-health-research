I can't work out anymore because I have to spend most of my time studying for college, but the gym I would go to had a seperate room for situations like that, I guess?  They only had it avaliable for women.  \n\nSo I'd just go in there and work out until almost passing out, but the entire time I just...felt gross?  Not sweaty gross, not hot gross, just...I could feel every part of my body fat moving and it made me sick.  I'd usually use the restroom while I was there, too, since before the gym I would drink water so I wouldn't pass out or something, I dunno.  \n\nI'd usually end up crying myself to sleep at night over it lol.\n\nEdit:  Goddamn I am braindead.  I put down the thing about the bathroom because there was a huge mirror heading to the bathroom and I would always stop and start body checking and that is what REALLY set me off and made me cry lol.\n\nEdit Two:  Fucking TYPOS",
