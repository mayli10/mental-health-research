                "Text": "I'ma tell a story. Tl;Dr at end. \n\nI have some pretty severe anxiety (I struggle still but am getting much better with an ED and PTSD) and as a result some things are just... Wayyyy too much for me. I need a *lot* of space sometimes just to get through the day. But sometimes, I can't bend the world to meet my needs. That's when my partner steps in and tries to mitigate and do damage control. \nWe made plans to go visit a few friends and agreed to stop at the grocery store to pick up wine and some stuff to cook. I was having a tough day already and grocery stores are notoriously difficult for me, but I went in anyway to try and be a trooper. When we got in, I had to pick something that I would make (I'm the only vegan so I often end up dictating the food choices, pros and cons for me because I love getting to control my food but I hate feeling responsible for other people's happiness, it's too much pressure). I start scanning the aisles, I go up and down each one a thousand times and that anxiety starts to set in. My partner finds me in the frozen aisle looking like I'm about to cry. He asks what's wrong and the best I can come out with is \"I hate this\". He figures it out pretty quickly and asks me to go back to the car, he'll pick something. \nI'm feeling angry and embarrassed at that point, I  march back to the car and do a bit of yelling and telling myself that I'm stupid and why do I let things get to me, etc. \nHe comes back and says \"hey I picked something out and I think it'll be perfect, you're gonna love it  and it's vegan, ill cook it when we get there so you can just chill\" at that point I was grateful but so mad at myself for falling apart. I was in a terrible mood. We got to the address and he asks me if I need to take a minute. Im upset and grumpy so I say \"I don't know\". He reads between the lines and says \"if you want to, you can hang out here and just have some 'you' time. I'll tell them you're on the phone with work. Just text me when you're going to come in and I'll start cooking\". I nod, still grumpy and not appropriately appreciative. He heads in, feeds them the lie, and they just chat and hang out, as far as they know I'm doing great, not hiding in the car pulling myself together. I take about 30minutes before putting on my big girl pants and heading in. They never knew. \n\nBasically, I'm saying OP you're a treasure. Regardless of what your friend is struggling with, you helping her out is a really cool thing to do. For me, its my mental health and I'm so lucky to have someone who can help me and adapt to different situations that I can't control yet. For your friend, she is dealing with her weight and evidently struggling with the consequences of her size, but she is very lucky to have someone who cares enough about her and her feelings and whether or not she's doing okay to prioritize it during their holiday. It's ok that you didn't like doing it, it's ok that you kinda want to bitch about it--bottom line is, you did somebody a massive favor that they couldn't possibly have asked you to do, and it makes you a good person even if you didn't enjoy it. \n\nTl;Dr: I have issues with food and mental health. My bf always helps me out even when I'm being bitchy and inconvenient and lame. It's super cool to do that for other people. I'm proud of OP. \n\n\nEdit to add: HAHAHA  I just realized what sub this is. I straight up thought I was in a different sub. I'm so sorry if any of this was patronizing I was writing it as though it were for people who didn't necessarily understand EDs ",

It is normal to reach a point were you feel bad or annoyed, specially cos you put so much to help others, sometimes is not enough and you are neglecting yourself.   \nFor the eating part, I know from a friend in a similar situation as your friend, that she doesn't like to eat in public, she feels deeply ashamed, scare to the point of giving her panic attacks. Because lets be honest, heavier people get a lot of bullshit for enjoying food. If I,  a small person, eats 3 donuts, people would laugh and clap \"because I am so cool to eat like that\" (ignoring if I ate nothing for the past 3 days) but if someone overweight eats like that they get people staring and maybe uncomfortable comments of \" I am just worry about your health\". So understandable they tend to eat in private more comfortable.   \nMaybe if you are open about some of your struggles, not that you have to reveal everything, she will be more open to you too. Almost every woman has body image issues, and not a great relationship with foot at some point, and we can support each other.",
