My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I\u2019d tell her to stop she\u2019d say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problems with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom \u201cyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs\u201d. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said \u201cyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs\u201d and she was like \u201chaha no 30 at least\u201d. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort. \n\nGuess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I\u2019m down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I\u2019m still a healthy weight. In reality, I went from being a teen that comfort ate and had problems with binging to an adult that starves herself and abuses ADHD meds to lose weight but ends up losing it hella slowly because of her binge tendencies, It\u2019s frighteningly easy to hide disordered eating when you\u2019re not the \u2018typical sufferer\u2019, especially if you\u2019re in a cultural or family environment that encourages weight loss at all costs.",

But a lot of Koreans have such a small bone structure that even at those low weights, they don't appear too bony or sickly.\n\nAlso idols work out a lot. They spend some ungodly hours dancing and exercising.\n\nNothing can really be done about the areas of your body you LOSE weight from. If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)\n\nStarvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",

Otherwise I'd be screwed because I do a ton of walking lol. But I have the opposite body type (short torso+long limbs = fridge waist+thin legs) and my legs are not very muscular.",

                    "Text": "This is a really good question. It's strange. But I think there's a couple factors (obviously not everything) but from my understanding 1. Korean culture is very homogenous, so the pressure to be thin is more pervasive, and beauty standards are more strict (as in, people will agree on beauty ideals more than in other countries with a more diverse population) this may be compounded by the fact that 2. People of an Asian ethnicity are frequently slimmer/have a smaller frame, so being a low BMI is less likely to *seem* unnatural (OBVIOUSLY there is HUGE individual variation here) and 3. Korean culture does not consider personal comments to others (who are already close) to be as rude as in other cultures (further cementing beauty ideals because they're more likely to perpetuated in daily life, perhaps) 4. Korean women seem to be generally afraid of bulking and therefore are not as keen on exercise as a weight loss method because of this\n\nBut I think these factors may be a reason the diet culture is so entrenched. I think it's likely that many young people in Korea are aware, to some degree, that starvation diets and other disordered nonsense is unhealthy, but perhaps they belief the social payoff is just worth it.\n\nThere's other things I can think of too.. I don't think the fitness craze of the 80s hit Korea nearly as hard (if at all? I know little about Korea in the 80s) so being fit and muscular doesn't seem to have ever been held in such a high regard. So weight loss efforts tends to emphasize just being THINNER, not fitter. And indeed a starvation diet is about the quickest way to get thinner, not fitter.\n\nObviously this is not the whole picture at all and you have to take what I say with a grain of salt anyway because I'm not Korean and have never been to Korea lol",

My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I\u2019d tell her to stop she\u2019d say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problems with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom \u201cyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs\u201d. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said \u201cyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs\u201d and she was like \u201chaha no 30 at least\u201d. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort. \n\nGuess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I\u2019m down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I\u2019m still a healthy weight. In reality, I went from being a teen that comfort ate and had problems with binging to an adult that starves herself and abuses ADHD meds to lose weight but ends up losing it hella slowly because of her binge tendencies, It\u2019s frighteningly easy to hide disordered eating when you\u2019re not the \u2018typical sufferer\u2019, especially if you\u2019re in a cultural or family environment that encourages weight loss at all costs.",

But a lot of Koreans have such a small bone structure that even at those low weights, they don't appear too bony or sickly.\n\nAlso idols work out a lot. They spend some ungodly hours dancing and exercising.\n\nNothing can really be done about the areas of your body you LOSE weight from. If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)\n\nStarvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",

But a lot of Koreans have such a small bone structure that even at those low weights, they don't appear too bony or sickly.\n\nAlso idols work out a lot. They spend some ungodly hours dancing and exercising.\n\nNothing can really be done about the areas of your body you LOSE weight from. If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)\n\nStarvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",

My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I\u2019d tell her to stop she\u2019d say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problems with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom \u201cyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs\u201d. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said \u201cyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs\u201d and she was like \u201chaha no 30 at least\u201d. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort. \n\nGuess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I\u2019m down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I\u2019m still a healthy weight. In reality, I went from being a teen that comfort ate and had problems with binging to an adult that starves herself and abuses ADHD meds to lose weight but ends up losing it hella slowly because of her binge tendencies, It\u2019s frighteningly easy to hide disordered eating when you\u2019re not the \u2018typical sufferer\u2019, especially if you\u2019re in a cultural or family environment that encourages weight loss at all costs.",

My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I\u2019d tell her to stop she\u2019d say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problems with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom \u201cyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs\u201d. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said \u201cyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs\u201d and she was like \u201chaha no 30 at least\u201d. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort. \n\nGuess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I\u2019m down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I\u2019m still a healthy weight. In reality, I went from being a teen that comfort ate and had problems with binging to an adult that starves herself and abuses ADHD meds to lose weight but ends up losing it hella slowly because of her binge tendencies, It\u2019s frighteningly easy to hide disordered eating when you\u2019re not the \u2018typical sufferer\u2019, especially if you\u2019re in a cultural or family environment that encourages weight loss at all costs.",

But a lot of Koreans have such a small bone structure that even at those low weights, they don't appear too bony or sickly.\n\nAlso idols work out a lot. They spend some ungodly hours dancing and exercising.\n\nNothing can really be done about the areas of your body you LOSE weight from. If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)\n\nStarvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",

Otherwise I'd be screwed because I do a ton of walking lol. But I have the opposite body type (short torso+long limbs = fridge waist+thin legs) and my legs are not very muscular.",

I think she did end up losing like 25lbs and getting more toned over the first couple of years so I guess it worked? Even if she couldn\u2019t stick to all the diets it definitely made her exercise more regularly and probably made her more conscious of what she was eating outside the show.",

My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I\u2019d tell her to stop she\u2019d say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problems with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom \u201cyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs\u201d. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said \u201cyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs\u201d and she was like \u201chaha no 30 at least\u201d. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort. \n\nGuess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I\u2019m down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I\u2019m still a healthy weight. In reality, I went from being a teen that comfort ate and had problems with binging to an adult that starves herself and abuses ADHD meds to lose weight but ends up losing it hella slowly because of her binge tendencies, It\u2019s frighteningly easy to hide disordered eating when you\u2019re not the \u2018typical sufferer\u2019, especially if you\u2019re in a cultural or family environment that encourages weight loss at all costs.",

They spend some ungodly hours dancing and exercising.\n\nNothing can really be done about the areas of your body you LOSE weight from. If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)\n\nStarvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",

Otherwise I'd be screwed because I do a ton of walking lol. But I have the opposite body type (short torso+long limbs = fridge waist+thin legs) and my legs are not very muscular.",

I think she did end up losing like 25lbs and getting more toned over the first couple of years so I guess it worked? Even if she couldn\u2019t stick to all the diets it definitely made her exercise more regularly and probably made her more conscious of what she was eating outside the show.",

My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I\u2019d tell her to stop she\u2019d say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problems with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom \u201cyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs\u201d. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said \u201cyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs\u201d and she was like \u201chaha no 30 at least\u201d. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort. \n\nGuess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I\u2019m down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I\u2019m still a healthy weight. In reality, I went from being a teen that comfort ate and had problems with binging to an adult that starves herself and abuses ADHD meds to lose weight but ends up losing it hella slowly because of her binge tendencies, It\u2019s frighteningly easy to hide disordered eating when you\u2019re not the \u2018typical sufferer\u2019, especially if you\u2019re in a cultural or family environment that encourages weight loss at all costs.",

But a lot of Koreans have such a small bone structure that even at those low weights, they don't appear too bony or sickly.\n\nAlso idols work out a lot. They spend some ungodly hours dancing and exercising.\n\nNothing can really be done about the areas of your body you LOSE weight from. If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)\n\nStarvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",

Otherwise I'd be screwed because I do a ton of walking lol. But I have the opposite body type (short torso+long limbs = fridge waist+thin legs) and my legs are not very muscular.",

My mom spent my whole teen years calling me fat and whenever I\u2019d tell her to stop she\u2019d say she was doing it out of love and that Canadian/American parents not being brutally honest with their kids is why these countries have problems with obesity. When I was 18 I went on vacation with a group of my family friends and this woman told my mom \u201cyour daughter could be pretty if she lost 30 lbs\u201d. I was like a BMI of 25 or 26 at that point so I was a lil chubby at most but to Russians I might as well have been obese. My mom then told me how she said I needed to lose weight, I said \u201cyeah I know I need to lose like 15lbs\u201d and she was like \u201chaha no 30 at least\u201d. My mom also spent that whole trip talking about what a nice body one of my family friends had. Girl was maybe a very fit BMI of 19 at most, worked out every day of the trip, and pretty much lived off fruit and salad at our all inclusive resort. \n\nGuess who spent the next three years repeatedly losing 10-20 lbs just to gain half of it back each time and dealing with never ending cycles of binging and restriction. I\u2019m down almost 30 lbs now and everyone thinks I just outgrew my chubbiness or developed a healthier/more active lifestyle when I went to college because the weight loss was so gradual and I\u2019m still a healthy weight. In reality, I went from being a teen that comfort ate and had problems with binging to an adult that starves herself and abuses ADHD meds to lose weight but ends up losing it hella slowly because of her binge tendencies, It\u2019s frighteningly easy to hide disordered eating when you\u2019re not the \u2018typical sufferer\u2019, especially if you\u2019re in a cultural or family environment that encourages weight loss at all costs.",

But a lot of Koreans have such a small bone structure that even at those low weights, they don't appear too bony or sickly.\n\nAlso idols work out a lot. They spend some ungodly hours dancing and exercising.\n\nNothing can really be done about the areas of your body you LOSE weight from. If you gain weight back quickly, it will tend to gather around your midsection (and very slowly redistribute over time) but I don't think anything impacts how you LOSE it (aside from just your body fat distribution and how your body chooses to lose it)\n\nStarvation diets will do nothing great for your body composition, honestly, because you can't gain muscle on a deficit. In fact, I think any time you lose a lot of fat you tend to lose some muscle as well. So basically, yeah... for a fit body, you do need to exercise. I think working out on a deficit still helps you retain muscle even if losing some of it is inevitable.",

Otherwise I'd be screwed because I do a ton of walking lol. But I have the opposite body type (short torso+long limbs = fridge waist+thin legs) and my legs are not very muscular.",
