Basically any movement that isn't an intentional workout, like fidgeting, pacing, walking for a purpose, etc, adds up a ton over time. So people who jiggle their legs and stuff will be able to eat more and weigh less. Wild/frustrating because most of it is totally unintentional...but has led to me not intentionally stopping my fidgeting anymore yay just calories out the window.",
