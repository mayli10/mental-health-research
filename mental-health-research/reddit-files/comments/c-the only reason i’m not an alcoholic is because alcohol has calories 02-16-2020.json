                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                    "Text": ">too expensive to be an alcoholic \n\nBig mood.\n\nThe story of a journey.\n\n\nA *long* while back I went on a \u201cmission\u201d to stock up on a 151-192proof grain alcohol of quality. Wanted it so badly because I was giving far too much money to EvanWilliams, JackDaniels, & CaptainMorgan\ud83e\udd43 \u201c*BuTi DIdnThAVeA pROblEmOr NEthANg!\u201d \n\nI figured; \u201c*Hey, it comes in the same 750mL bottles that are around the same price. A 190/192 proof is 95-96% ABV that means to get [gram amount] of pure ethanol alcohol into this tolerant body I only need to drink like half the amount of fluid I\u2019d need to drink for a 100 proof distilled spirit\u2014 so a bottle will last twice as long and I can get down my drinks in a smaller time window theoretically. And as a bonus the purealcohol-to-calorie efficiency is also better. SO THIS IS PERFECT FOR ME! I\u2019ll totes get shitfaced for cheap __if I take [medicine-name] and chug some jiggers mixed in a can of of Diet Coke on a totally empty stomach__ IT\u2019LL SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS!*\u201d\n\nLong story short: Despite Everclear/Spirytus not being illegal to transport/buy/trade/sell/own in every area of my stare (*in spite of what the web claims*) I couldn\u2019t find a single place in my area or immediate surrounding areas that wanted to stock it or send it to me. Something to do with either the insurance or some tax they have to pay to stock it not being worth it because it was so niche and almost no one around who wasn\u2019t a derelict alcoholic wanted it for more than novelty reasons. I didn\u2019t really give up immediately because the allure of getting equally inebriated for half the price/effort was strong. I still failed and that failure probably saved me from alcohol poisoning tbh.\n\n\nIn conclusion: I decided to just start working 4 extra hours each week to pay for my alcohol painlessly and started skipping lunch again to save calories. Oof",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

I wasn't trying to be \"tone deaf\", all I was saying is that although its really easy to go over your limits with pot (and other drugs) I've found that finding this balance has helped me a LOT. I tried to recover on my own, but I don't think I can because this is take 3. I thought if I pitched in my experience, you might hear something you needed to hear. Just trying to be potentially helpful to you, or anyone who might read my comment. Its been working for me, and it might work for someone else. I'm sorry that it doesn't for you, let's just forget this conversation ever happened, touche?",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

                        "Text": "Honestly, I find this hard too. What's been working for me lately is to buy in smaller amounts. You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",

Then if I do end up getting the drunk munchies, it\u2019s double worse because I\u2019ll just binge on top of the alcohol calories!\n\nSmoking is so much better to me, even if I end up getting the munchies for a bit, because at least then I can convince myself to eat the fruit in the fridge rather than burgers and tacos and cookies like when I\u2019m drunk (I only want shit food when I\u2019m drunk). It helps with my depression on the daily, makes me more optimistic, and I\u2019m so much less anxious overall. The problem about it is that I have an addictive personality, and smoking doesn\u2019t impair my ability to do normal tasks (the reason why I don\u2019t drink a lot) so it\u2019s hard for me to not be constantly high when I have weed at my disposal.

Sure, if I eat a few edibles every day for a month I would be completely fried, but I've found in reasonable amounts it really calms down my anxiety. It also makes me more introspective, while avoiding all the self-righteous attitudes that might come with a deep look into your own soul. You can do these things in a sober mind, but weed is a nice shortcut. I'm eating a big bowl of vegetable soup right now, because while I was smoking in the quarry I realized that the better I treat myself, the better I'm treating everyone around me. If I'm in pain, mentally or physically, it's not just me who has to deal with that. I'm putting that stuff on everyone I interact with, whether I want to or not, so taking better care of myself is like caring about the people I love more than anything. \n\nSorry for the rambling, but seeing \"useless fucking stoner\" made me mad. It makes me question myself, even though I know what I'm doing is okay and good for me. Maybe it would be good for you too, even though it's a hassle to get and expensive.",

You'll spend more money in the long run this way, but the less I have on hand the less likely I am to go out and buy more to smoke. This helps me space it out, like if I had bought 4 grams the last time and smoked it all in a couple weeks, I can take a break for a while. Also, make it harder for yourself to find the time and place to smoke. Keep yourself busy, with fun things or productive things, so that it can be a once a day treat. \nI'm no master on limiting my use, so take my advice with a grain of salt. This is just what's been working for the past few days. The thing is, I don't have my own place. The lady I'm living with is someone I respect, and she knows I smoke but doesn't want me to smoke inside. She says as long as I smoke in the backyard or something, she has no problem with it. So, when it's dark or cold, its harder for me to smoke. This means I have a limited window during the day for it, and if I miss that window, I don't smoke that day. Maybe a way to do this for yourself, is to arrange your daily life in a way that gives you that little smoking window. Something to think about, hope I helped!",
