For example, pain meds like Tylenol or NSAIDS can cause ulcers. If your goal is to hide your ED, try explaining that you did one of the things that cause ulcers. If you are making yourself puke, stop doing that immediately - Its not effective for weight loss and you'll always see that as an excuse to eat whatever you want since you can always resort to puking. Then, you'll most likely feel like shit for binging like a lot of ED people do. Also, if they check your teeth they may be able to tell you're making yourself puke.\n\nIf you're going to lose weight, try a higher calorie restriction like 1200 or 1100 as long as it involves consuming less calories than you burn.",

For example, pain meds like Tylenol or NSAIDS can cause ulcers. If your goal is to hide your ED, try explaining that you did one of the things that cause ulcers. If you are making yourself puke, stop doing that immediately - Its not effective for weight loss and you'll always see that as an excuse to eat whatever you want since you can always resort to puking. Then, you'll most likely feel like shit for binging like a lot of ED people do. Also, if they check your teeth they may be able to tell you're making yourself puke.\n\nIf you're going to lose weight, try a higher calorie restriction like 1200 or 1100 as long as it involves consuming less calories than you burn.",

Explain that a lot of people with eating disorders puke easily without trying and thats what happened and it was unintentional. You were just eating too fast and gag reflex happened.

Something is wrong. Streaks of blood. You panic and stop. But find yourself coughing up acid anyway. The pain is unimaginable but the adrenaline and fear have put it on hold. Because you are slowly beginning to choke. Your lungs are filling with the contents of your stomach, mostly acid. You are drowning, on dry land, unable to make a sound, to call for help, you are choking, drowning, coughing up blood and acid and vomit and slowly suffocating in the mixture. \n\nOr, you could simply bleed to death, much kinder. But option 1 is not uncommon. And it is one of the worst ways to die. I urge anyone here, anyone considering purging or anyone on the fence about a binge, anyone who doesn't think recovery is worth it...please...every time you DO NOT PURGE counts. Every time you do your best counts. Food CANNOT HURT YOU. This disorder CAN and WILL. \n\nAnd don't go on \"it will never happen to me\" because it does. It does happen to you. And me. \n\nSincerely, someone with a ruptured esophagus with a life down the drain at 23.",

What ulcer symptoms are you getting? Also, if you think you might have an ulcer, avoid dairy and alcohol. Go with high fiber foods, fiber also helps make you feel fuller for longer since it helps take up more space in your stomach",

For example, pain meds like Tylenol or NSAIDS can cause ulcers. If your goal is to hide your ED, try explaining that you did one of the things that cause ulcers. If you are making yourself puke, stop doing that immediately - Its not effective for weight loss and you'll always see that as an excuse to eat whatever you want since you can always resort to puking. Then, you'll most likely feel like shit for binging like a lot of ED people do. Also, if they check your teeth they may be able to tell you're making yourself puke.\n\nIf you're going to lose weight, try a higher calorie restriction like 1200 or 1100 as long as it involves consuming less calories than you burn.",

I didn't care if people saw or heard me. It was exhausting. I couldn't go a day without purging (or bingeing, really...because if you're gonna throw it up anyway why eat a normal amount of food amirite). I was miserable and I didn't even lose any weight?! In a way I'm glad I can't purge much anymore. I don't have the amount of shamelessness as I used to, so I won't unless I'm sure people won't hear me and I've just moved back with family so...yeah. If I binge I either fast/exercise or forgive myself and try again tomorrow. Depends on the mood but at least it's not killing me as much as throwing up.",

For example, pain meds like Tylenol or NSAIDS can cause ulcers. If your goal is to hide your ED, try explaining that you did one of the things that cause ulcers. If you are making yourself puke, stop doing that immediately - Its not effective for weight loss and you'll always see that as an excuse to eat whatever you want since you can always resort to puking. Then, you'll most likely feel like shit for binging like a lot of ED people do. Also, if they check your teeth they may be able to tell you're making yourself puke.\n\nIf you're going to lose weight, try a higher calorie restriction like 1200 or 1100 as long as it involves consuming less calories than you burn.",

For example, pain meds like Tylenol or NSAIDS can cause ulcers. If your goal is to hide your ED, try explaining that you did one of the things that cause ulcers. If you are making yourself puke, stop doing that immediately - Its not effective for weight loss and you'll always see that as an excuse to eat whatever you want since you can always resort to puking. Then, you'll most likely feel like shit for binging like a lot of ED people do. Also, if they check your teeth they may be able to tell you're making yourself puke.\n\nIf you're going to lose weight, try a higher calorie restriction like 1200 or 1100 as long as it involves consuming less calories than you burn.",

For example, pain meds like Tylenol or NSAIDS can cause ulcers. If your goal is to hide your ED, try explaining that you did one of the things that cause ulcers. If you are making yourself puke, stop doing that immediately - Its not effective for weight loss and you'll always see that as an excuse to eat whatever you want since you can always resort to puking. Then, you'll most likely feel like shit for binging like a lot of ED people do.

If you are making yourself puke, stop doing that immediately - Its not effective for weight loss and you'll always see that as an excuse to eat whatever you want since you can always resort to puking. Then, you'll most likely feel like shit for binging like a lot of ED people do.

I\u2019m getting heart burn and acid reflex,odd stomach pains and whenever I eat or drink anything I feel really sore and bloated. I\u2019m not quite sure but I think that it\u2019s something like a stomach ulcer. And actually I\u2019ve been trying to avoid dairy lately because it\u2019s been making me feel like I\u2019m about to explode :\u2019) again I\u2019m not 100% sure if it\u2019s a stomach ulcer but I can\u2019t think of anything else.",
