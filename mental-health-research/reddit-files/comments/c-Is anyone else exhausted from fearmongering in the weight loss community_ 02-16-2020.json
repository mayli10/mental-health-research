Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Fruit is good, actually? It has fiber and vitamins and nutrients and it's reasonably low-calorie. The alternative to eating fruit is not \"eating nothing\", it's \"eating something sugary that is much worse for you\".

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

Like seriously I\u2019ve seen them argue about whether or not things like TOFU or SOY SAUCE are processed foods. Also to me \u201cprocessed\u201d seems like a pretty arbitrary distinction, like what even counts as a process? A lot of people on that sub also do no salt, oil or sugar like yes let\u2019s make food taste as bland as possible so you don\u2019t want to eat it and also give yourself low sodium and possibly an iodine deficiency in the process, that sounds healthy. \n\nIdk the vegan community is just full of weird diets and borderline ED behavior and I find it very stressful to deal with.",

                "Text": "The actual fear and panic some ppl express over eating unknown calorie counts or \"untrustworthy\" calorie counts or even just the expectation/assumption that any food not made and weighed by themselves is \"unsafe\" is like... this is how EDs start. It instills a fear of food in you, a dichotomy of \"good foods\" vs \"bad foods\", the pressure not to allow bad foods into your body or else you're failing and you're going to get FAT and there MUST be over 2000cal in that small serve of brown rice pasta... That's all disordered.\n\nIt goes hand-in-hand with people not ever, ever being able to eat over a certain amount of calories, even if it would still put them at/under maintenance. Like yeah, I know some people can't do \"cheat days\"/\"cheat meals\" because it will trigger a binge for them - I'm one of those people. But like, I can still make a choice to say well, I'm at a party, so I'm going to eat some of this party food and enjoy it, and I will have a light dinner/eat less tomorrow to compensate. If someone can't do that - not because they don't want to, bc it's fine not to want party food, but because they're AFRAID to - then it's a bad sign, hombre.\n\nThis reminds me of that post where someone posted this tiny fucking sliver of cake and talked about how they were able to fit it into a 1200 day and there were comments estimating a piece of cake that was probably no more than 300cal to be like... 800-1000cal and that they shouldn't have done it and that this was going to upset their progress. It was all the shittiest proana bullshit but they don't KNOW it's disordered, which is what makes it so dangerous.\n\nActually I think the worst concept is the one that says eating over your TDEE at any point immediately ruins all your progress.

                "Text": "I went to lunch with my family yesterday & ordered off the low-calorie section of the menu. My dish was labeled as 450cals or something, chicken with rice and black beans. So the server drops our meal, and I\u2019m staring at these rice and beans and all I can think is \u201crice and beans are not low calorie foods and there is no way this dish is low calorie with rice and beans and oh god why did I order it\u201d\n\nSo yeah long story short it was super fun only eating a couple bites of my food when I had set this family lunch as a way to enjoy myself and not worry about food anxiety bc yeah! I do not trust calorie info anymore! \n\nTHE BEST PART was trying to estimate how many calories I ate from my few bites. The food Itself wasn\u2019t even over 500 calories and I told myself \u201cjust track it like 500 calories to be on the safe side\u201d 8-)",
