Of course, it doesn't actually have to be Monday but that's just an example. Like, it could be one day out of the week where there's a harm reduction advice post like this and people can just add in anything they've got to add as well. And since it's weekly, we'd be able to add in things that we weren't able to add in the week before because we may not have known. It could even be abbreviated as \"HRT of the Week\" or something.\n\nThe only downside I can think of with this is possible clutter, though. But I don't know. Now that I think about it, maybe it's just a really random idea so feel free to ignore my idiocy lol.",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top?

Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there.

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

My c/sing habit has recently started itself back up with incredible fervance since Thanksgiving and it's wreaking havoc on my teeth. Cavities, that translucent kind of see-through appearance, sensitivity and so on. Do you think the childrens mouthwash that you mentioned would help with this due to its extra fluoridation?

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top?

Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",

Since making a bunch of singular threads on the harm reduction matter would put us at further risk of getting banned then what if there was just one that was pinned to the top? And then maybe people could either comment with more ideas if they have any *or* a mod could initiate the post, add-ons/advice could then be sent to said mod(s) and then edited into the post itself? Something along those lines but far more put together than what I'm saying thus far. There could also be a rule that the harm reduction tips have to be worded a certain specific, PG way in order to be added into the post. \n\nOr, a far simpler version: we could just make a thread that has a *link* to a Google drive page or Microsoft document and etc with a bunch of harm reduction advice/tips on there. That way it's just all in one. \n\nMan, it's really messed up that we have to tip toe like this when all we're trying to do is help each other be a little safer doing the dangerous things that comes with EDs that we're going to do either way *because* of our EDs \ud83d\ude15",
