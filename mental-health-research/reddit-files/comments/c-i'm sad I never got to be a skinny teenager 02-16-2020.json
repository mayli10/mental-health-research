My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

                            "Text": "I'm pretty inexperienced myself. My first kiss was pretty recent. I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

I did try to ask one of my guy friends to dance for one song since I disnt dance for the whole night, and i thought he woukd be nice enough to hunor me for 3 minutes, but he sucked air in through his teeth, grimaced, and said \"yeah... no\" and laughed awkwardly and walked away.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

I did try to ask one of my guy friends to dance for one song since I disnt dance for the whole night, and i thought he woukd be nice enough to hunor me for 3 minutes, but he sucked air in through his teeth, grimaced, and said \"yeah... no\" and laughed awkwardly and walked away.",

I even got voted the yearbook superlative \"class clown\" every year of high school because i was trying so hard to be liked. One of my worst experiences was going shopping one day with a group of girls I'd never hung out with before but for some reason they invited me and every store we went to didn't have a plus-size section so I just sat on a bench outside the dressing rooms while they tried on cute outfits and played on my phone and tried not to cry for 3 hours. I'm very evil but it feels good seeing them on facebook having already had kids and shotgun-wedding-ed to their shitty hs boyfriends living in trailers hooked on pills tbh.",

                        "Text": "Prom was rough because of all the aforementioned events, and I also did competitive academics in HS and I had to leave for a city 6 hours away at 4:00am the next morning to make it to the meet. My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience.

                        "Text": "Prom was rough because of all the aforementioned events, and I also did competitive academics in HS and I had to leave for a city 6 hours away at 4:00am the next morning to make it to the meet. My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

I know it's easy to focus on how things could be better, but I think that kind of negative thinking just ruins things that should otherwise be wonderful experiences. Maybe you didn't have fun for your birthday this year, but there are plenty of birthdays ahead of you. Just think of something you would like to do and go do it next year.

                            "Text": "Prom was rough because of all the aforementioned events, and I also did competitive academics in HS and I had to leave for a city 6 hours away at 4:00am the next morning to make it to the meet. My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I did try to ask one of my guy friends to dance for one song since I disnt dance for the whole night, and i thought he woukd be nice enough to hunor me for 3 minutes, but he sucked air in through his teeth, grimaced, and said \"yeah... no\" and laughed awkwardly and walked away.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

I even got voted the yearbook superlative \"class clown\" every year of high school because i was trying so hard to be liked. One of my worst experiences was going shopping one day with a group of girls I'd never hung out with before but for some reason they invited me and every store we went to didn't have a plus-size section so I just sat on a bench outside the dressing rooms while they tried on cute outfits and played on my phone and tried not to cry for 3 hours. I'm very evil but it feels good seeing them on facebook having already had kids and shotgun-wedding-ed to their shitty hs boyfriends living in trailers hooked on pills tbh.",

                        "Text": "Prom was rough because of all the aforementioned events, and I also did competitive academics in HS and I had to leave for a city 6 hours away at 4:00am the next morning to make it to the meet. My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

By the time you're thirty lots of formerly fat people will be thin and formerly thin people will be fat, and you'll realise no one was as defined by their weight as you imagined.

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience.

I even got voted the yearbook superlative \"class clown\" every year of high school because i was trying so hard to be liked. One of my worst experiences was going shopping one day with a group of girls I'd never hung out with before but for some reason they invited me and every store we went to didn't have a plus-size section so I just sat on a bench outside the dressing rooms while they tried on cute outfits and played on my phone and tried not to cry for 3 hours. I'm very evil but it feels good seeing them on facebook having already had kids and shotgun-wedding-ed to their shitty hs boyfriends living in trailers hooked on pills tbh.",

                        "Text": "Prom was rough because of all the aforementioned events, and I also did competitive academics in HS and I had to leave for a city 6 hours away at 4:00am the next morning to make it to the meet. My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience.

I'm 27, going to be 28 soon and it's freaking me out to think that I'll be in my 30s and still fat.\n\nWhen I started highschool there was a morbidly obese older student and I remember thinking to myself, \"Wow, I'm never going to end up like her.\" I'm pretty sure I ended up being way fatter than her, and she also took care of her appearance otherwise and had lots of friends and always seemed happy whereas I didn't.\n\nThe awareness that my 10 year highschool reuinion would be coming up soon is actually what kickstarted me into restricting. I won't be thin in time for it but I'll be a lot smaller than I used to be, and honestly even though I'm still fat, I'm gonna look like a supermodel compared to how everyone from highschool would remember me, LOL.\n\nLike you, I feel like I missed out on a lot of experiences because I was fat. The truth is though that the grass is always greener and there would've been other things that made you miserable in high school too. Nobody had a perfect experience except people who peaked in highschool. Now you have the power and autonomy of a grown adult and it's up to YOU how you spend your life from now.",

I even got voted the yearbook superlative \"class clown\" every year of high school because i was trying so hard to be liked. One of my worst experiences was going shopping one day with a group of girls I'd never hung out with before but for some reason they invited me and every store we went to didn't have a plus-size section so I just sat on a bench outside the dressing rooms while they tried on cute outfits and played on my phone and tried not to cry for 3 hours. I'm very evil but it feels good seeing them on facebook having already had kids and shotgun-wedding-ed to their shitty hs boyfriends living in trailers hooked on pills tbh.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience.

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience.

I\u2019ve had an ED since age 11 and I\u2019m now 42. I never got overweight, only \u201cnormal and healthy\u201d weights after inpatient treatment. Looking back now, my teen years didn\u2019t mean a thing and nor will yours. Personally my best years were late 20s through my 30s. While I still have always struggled with my ED my whole life, I have had it under control for 10/12 years now. I always stay thin, but not sickly and super underweight. You\u2019ll come to realize that it\u2019s impossible to maintain 88lbs consistently. You\u2019ll still want to be thin, and will likely always have those demons, but as you age, hopefully you\u2019ll be able to find a sweet spot like I did. People are going to praise you way more when you don\u2019t gain your freshman 20, and all the skinny girls from HS do. People are going to look at you with much more \u201cwow how does she keep herself thin after A/B/C life event?!\u201d I had a baby 3 years ago and I\u2019m still 5\u20197 and 115-120lbs consistently at 42. While all the girls I went to school with are mostly now overweight after having children 10-15 years ago. And I had mine at 38! Please trust that you have so much more time to get the body you want. I have found a really good comfortable place with my ED. I have learned self discipline and I no longer binge (always been ana). My body just knows how much I need to stay healthy, while maintaining my weight where I feel most comfortable. I never feel hungry. I eat and enjoy the things I like, just in small portions. Self discipline is key. While my eating is still considered disordered to most, I\u2019m still healthy. I don\u2019t workout or anything like that and I\u2019m definitely NOT naturally thin. But honestly, you\u2019ll look back on high school years and laugh. Believe that. You won\u2019t regret being a skinny teen, you\u2019ll laugh because you\u2019ll be a knockout for the rest of your life.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

                        "Text": "Prom was rough because of all the aforementioned events, and I also did competitive academics in HS and I had to leave for a city 6 hours away at 4:00am the next morning to make it to the meet. My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

                            "Text": "I'm pretty inexperienced myself. My first kiss was pretty recent. I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

                            "Text": "I'm pretty inexperienced myself. My first kiss was pretty recent. I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience. I would say a night in with somebody you love is probably a more rewarding experience.",

I\u2019m 21 and I feel like all the time I could have spent being a teen and doing teenager things, I instead invested in being an ~Ana butterfly~ with the added caveat of actually gaining weight through constant guilt-fueled binge eating. I think a lot of us developed our behaviors/fixations in our teens but with all sorts of outcomes. Some of us are anorexic, some bulimic, some have BED, etc. But not a single one of us is was a truly happy teenager, roughly speaking. So I hope it helps just a little to know that this is a really common experience and while you can\u2019t get your teens back, you have so much exciting shit you can\u2019t even imagine awaiting you down the line. (Shit, I might add, that isn\u2019t contingent on weight loss!)",

I've been thin my whole life, but I'm transgender and so I spent my entire childhood and teen years living a different life than the one I wanted. I wasn't comfortable with how people saw me or how I saw myself and because of my appearance I missed out on a lot of experiences I probably otherwise would have had. These things aren't forever though. It took a few years, but I'm finally living my life the way I want to and I'm finally comfortable with myself, with my appearance. Things aren't perfect and I do sometimes wish I hadn't missed out on a lot of experiences people can only have as teenagers, but the way I prefer to look at it is that I'm still young and I have the rest of my life to experience amazing things :) Just remember that most things in your life can be changed. If you don't like something you can change it. You just need to focus on finding a way to change it that works for you. I'm sure you can do it. It just takes time.",

I did try to ask one of my guy friends to dance for one song since I disnt dance for the whole night, and i thought he woukd be nice enough to hunor me for 3 minutes, but he sucked air in through his teeth, grimaced, and said \"yeah... no\" and laughed awkwardly and walked away.",

My friends and I stayed up late after prom at one girl's house because a few of them were on the same team, I cried my makeup off in her bathroom and washed it all off, slept in my dress and woke up 2 hours later to change into my uniform and drive 6 hours. I wish I would have stayed home and gotten rest because I did really well at the meet and won quite a bit of scholarship money but I couldn't enjoy it because I felt fat and rejected and horrible. Self-love is tough man, eating disorders and poor body image will take away any positive you see about yourself. I'm trying. \n\nAnd my birthday went fine, actually! My friend studied with me for hours and bought me a lot of starbucks and the guy I'm seeing stayed with me the whole night while we both worked on projects and we fell asleep cuddling- which is a big victory bc I struggle a lot with affectionate touch between my ED and some Bad Events that happened as kid. I genuinely don't mind that my birthday falls around this time, like I said- never been a big birthday person, they feel so self-centered to me. And I've tried drinking and bar culture and clubbing NOT my things. I don't like doing things on my birthday, it's just fun to fantasize about being skinny and slutty even tho I probably will never be either of those things, but my mental illness brain says I'd be happier if I were, even if, realistically, I know I wouldnt.",

It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job. So I guess even though I was lucky enough to find a guy who wasn't a creep or a total jerk it still wasn't that great of an experience.
