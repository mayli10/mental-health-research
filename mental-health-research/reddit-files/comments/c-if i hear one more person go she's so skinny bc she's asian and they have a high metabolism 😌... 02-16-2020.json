I think there was one documentary i watched a while back that had \"thin\" people gain weight on purpose and it said that the asian guy in the group of participants gained the least weight but it was too long ago for me to know the exact details and idk if i believe it anyway since a lot of the people in that documentary said it was a struggle to consume as many calories as they were supposed to (lol i wish I was like that) so maybe that guy just couldnt actually eat enough to gain the weight.",

It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid.

That\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean some races are like immune to gaining weight. the reasons health concerns are relevant at lower BMIs for Asian people is, once again, bc of our frames.

The genes that are related or would promote obesity in ppl are things that affect energy intake like satiety, appetite, pleasure from food, etc and if you peer reviews of studies regarding \u201cskinny genes\u201d find that the contribution of genetics to weight gain is minor relative to diet, especially in the case of weight gain during adulthood.

Even if they aren't negative stereotypes (i.e. being smart/skinny), to do this is harmful not only for the race being stereotyped, but for those not in that race! I'm mixed white and Asian and can see what you mean by other races downplaying the Asian culture's success in those areas. It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid. I think in some cases like you said it's self-consoling but it's even worse when someone in a position of power puts that idea into their heads because it is definitely most difficult for those who don't \"live up\" to a positive stereotype :(",

That\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean some races are like immune to gaining weight. the reasons health concerns are relevant at lower BMIs for Asian people is, once again, bc of our frames. Things like where we store our fat, etc. Ur reaching conclusions that don\u2019t actually follow. \n\nBeyond that I literally can\u2019t find any credible source online to actually substantiate your claims that we\u2019re thin primarily bc of our genetics. The genes that are related or would promote obesity in ppl are things that affect energy intake like satiety, appetite, pleasure from food, etc and if you peer reviews of studies regarding \u201cskinny genes\u201d find that the contribution of genetics to weight gain is minor relative to diet, especially in the case of weight gain during adulthood.

TBH I don't even think she needs to chew and spit or anything else others have accused her of; she uses camera angles to her advantage, cuts food into pieces (e.g. gets 2 burritos, but cuts them in half and lays them side by side so it looks like 4), spreads foods out really thinly on big trays (e.g. takes a single portion of pasta and spreads it out covering a sheet tray), uses utensils that seem bigger than they are (she likes that wooden spoon, and most people see a wooden spoon and think it's one of those giant cooking ones, but if you watch her put it up to her mouth, it's only like soup spoon sized), and, perhaps most importantly, has her fiance behind the camera eating like half the food. If you actually pay attention to how much she eats, most of the time it seems like it could be within her TDEE on a day she exercises. Sorry for the rant lol.",

Even if they aren't negative stereotypes (i.e. being smart/skinny), to do this is harmful not only for the race being stereotyped, but for those not in that race! I'm mixed white and Asian and can see what you mean by other races downplaying the Asian culture's success in those areas. It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid. I think in some cases like you said it's self-consoling but it's even worse when someone in a position of power puts that idea into their heads because it is definitely most difficult for those who don't \"live up\" to a positive stereotype :(",

That\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean some races are like immune to gaining weight. the reasons health concerns are relevant at lower BMIs for Asian people is, once again, bc of our frames. Things like where we store our fat, etc. Ur reaching conclusions that don\u2019t actually follow. \n\nBeyond that I literally can\u2019t find any credible source online to actually substantiate your claims that we\u2019re thin primarily bc of our genetics. The genes that are related or would promote obesity in ppl are things that affect energy intake like satiety, appetite, pleasure from food, etc and if you peer reviews of studies regarding \u201cskinny genes\u201d find that the contribution of genetics to weight gain is minor relative to diet, especially in the case of weight gain during adulthood. We\u2019re not like immune to thermodynamics\n\nI\u2019m sorry to go off like this but what ur saying just isn\u2019t true and if ur friend really does apparently have the metabolism of like a 6\u20194\u201d weightlifter then she\u2019s an anomaly not a standard ",

One of them talked about eating 6 eggs and 2 slices of a bread a day for a week and was like 'I really recommend this if you want to lose weight quickly! I also exercised for 2 to 3 hours a day!' or another pair very casually brought up that they'd been bulimic in the past but now used veganism as a different form of controlling their food????

It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid.

That\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean some races are like immune to gaining weight. the reasons health concerns are relevant at lower BMIs for Asian people is, once again, bc of our frames.

The genes that are related or would promote obesity in ppl are things that affect energy intake like satiety, appetite, pleasure from food, etc and if you peer reviews of studies regarding \u201cskinny genes\u201d find that the contribution of genetics to weight gain is minor relative to diet, especially in the case of weight gain during adulthood.

It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid. I think in some cases like you said it's self-consoling but it's even worse when someone in a position of power puts that idea into their heads because it is definitely most difficult for those who don't \"live up\" to a positive stereotype :(",

That\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean some races are like immune to gaining weight. the reasons health concerns are relevant at lower BMIs for Asian people is, once again, bc of our frames.

The genes that are related or would promote obesity in ppl are things that affect energy intake like satiety, appetite, pleasure from food, etc and if you peer reviews of studies regarding \u201cskinny genes\u201d find that the contribution of genetics to weight gain is minor relative to diet, especially in the case of weight gain during adulthood.

That\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean some races are like immune to gaining weight. the reasons health concerns are relevant at lower BMIs for Asian people is, once again, bc of our frames.

The genes that are related or would promote obesity in ppl are things that affect energy intake like satiety, appetite, pleasure from food, etc and if you peer reviews of studies regarding \u201cskinny genes\u201d find that the contribution of genetics to weight gain is minor relative to diet, especially in the case of weight gain during adulthood.

It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid.

Even if they aren't negative stereotypes (i.e. being smart/skinny), to do this is harmful not only for the race being stereotyped, but for those not in that race! I'm mixed white and Asian and can see what you mean by other races downplaying the Asian culture's success in those areas. It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid. I think in some cases like you said it's self-consoling but it's even worse when someone in a position of power puts that idea into their heads because it is definitely most difficult for those who don't \"live up\" to a positive stereotype :(",

That\u2019s true. That doesn\u2019t mean some races are like immune to gaining weight. the reasons health concerns are relevant at lower BMIs for Asian people is, once again, bc of our frames. Things like where we store our fat, etc. Ur reaching conclusions that don\u2019t actually follow. \n\nBeyond that I literally can\u2019t find any credible source online to actually substantiate your claims that we\u2019re thin primarily bc of our genetics. The genes that are related or would promote obesity in ppl are things that affect energy intake like satiety, appetite, pleasure from food, etc and if you peer reviews of studies regarding \u201cskinny genes\u201d find that the contribution of genetics to weight gain is minor relative to diet, especially in the case of weight gain during adulthood.

They have a ton of self discipline, and I admire them for that (though that seems kind of morbid).\n\nHowever, another topic worth mentioning is that diet culture is the norm in Asia- almost everywhere you go there are diet products/pills/foods that promote seriously unhealthy habits. Everyone and their mom is always on some new fad diet or workout regiment. It doesn't help, though, that all of Asia's commercial clothing sizes are relatively tiny, putting pressure on people to be as thin as possible.\n\n**Not all Asians are like this, these are just my bad experiences. I don't mean to offend any one who is Asian. Plus, people who were raised in Asian households are some of the nicest, most well-mannered people I've ever met.** \n\n&#x200B;",

                "Text": "I'm Asian (Vietnamese to be exacted) and i used to be overweight, now i'm not living in vietnam anymore and as i go to the gym, i'm quite fit now. I can say there're other reason more than just metabolism for Asian being so Skinny: diet(less process food, eat more veggies, portion size, eat less dessert or dessert less sweet,etc), culture.\n\n1. **Diet:**\n\n\\- **Eating less process food:**\n\ni don't know about other asian country but deep fried stuff, process food, frozen already cooked meal,etc is not a part of our tradional meal. We do buy fresh ingredient and then froze it but not frozen frite, frozen nugget, etc i would say my mom bought frozen frite like twice a year. \n\nWe don't have that much variety for process food except instant noodles, people prefer to shop in traditional ourdoor market, everything fresh. We usually bought fresh ingredient like veggie, meat,etc nearly everyday, may be 3-4 times/week. My mom would froze fresh meat to conserve it but she doesn't buy already frozen meat.\n\nWe also eat fast food for speacial occasion, if it was a quick lunch, breakfast, we would prefer our traditionnal meal : healthier and more affordable. Vietnamese quick breakfast is \"banh mi\" - contain a lot of veggies\n\n\\- **Eating a lot of veggies**\n\nIn Vietnam there is so much variety of veggies and fruits and a diverse way to cook it too. A tradionnal vietnamese meal would contain at least 1 veggie dish or 1 veggie soup, 1 stir fried veggie dish, sometimes we cook meat with veggie. \n\nEvery meal has  to contain veggies and we love our veggies. I live in France now and i'm craving for my vietnamese veggies all the time, i can't live without it. \n\n\\- **Portion size**\n\nThere is an experience proving that if people eat from a bigger plate, they would fill the plate till full and over eat thing. \n\nWe asian usually don't eat from a plate, we eat with a small bowl fill with about 100-130g of steam rice and then we take smal amount of food in our bowl, eat lil by lil.\n\n**- Less sugar:**\n\nok, we put sugar in our food, not just dessert but then we don't eat a lot of dessert, our dessert is not as sweet as what i eat in France now. In vietnam, our dessert is fresh fruit, cake, pie or chocolate,candy is that popular, we eat it on speacial occassion too. \n\nSome French dessert or sugary snack is crazily sweet for me and other viet people, we just can't handle that level of sweetness.\n\n **2. Culture:**\n\nWell, we have more pressure to be skinny in Asia, Korea is famous for the crazy kpop diet, people eat insect in China to lose weight. In Vietnam, we are not that bad but overall, like other asian country, dieting culture and fat shaming are popular here. You know, you gain some weight and your neightbor would straight up tell you you're fat (not saying fat/body-shaming is effective, it's not, i was body-shamed my whole life, never lose any pound from it, i lost weight because of depression and go to the gym to recover from it along with changing my eating habit)\n\nFrom a mild level, as everyone is skinny, it's mostly that if we gain some weight, we would eat a lil bit less, our diet is already healthy so no big deal. At least from now, i'd never heard of any extreme diet in Vietnam. My aunt was overweight so she lose weight by drinking dieting milk for dinner, the other meal she ate like normal. There are chubby/curvy girls in Vietnam and some people prefer it.",

Even if they aren't negative stereotypes (i.e. being smart/skinny), to do this is harmful not only for the race being stereotyped, but for those not in that race! I'm mixed white and Asian and can see what you mean by other races downplaying the Asian culture's success in those areas. It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid. I think in some cases like you said it's self-consoling but it's even worse when someone in a position of power puts that idea into their heads because it is definitely most difficult for those who don't \"live up\" to a positive stereotype :(",

My other friend fought tirelessly to lose weight yet when she came to my parents house she was considered tiny and my mum wouldn't stop feeding her but when I went to hers, her mum told her she was fat all the time. I was always so confused. \nAll I know is that I've probably only seen 1 Chinese girl who was actually fat by European standards. \n\nAt work, if a child is on a lower percentile but are Chinese, they'd be considered normal but a Black child on the same percentile should be deemed 'failure to thrive'.\n\nMedically, their are big differences when race is involved.

It also harms other races by thinking that they're like pre-determined to have to try harder which is stupid.

We\u2019re not like immune to thermodynamics\n\nI\u2019m sorry to go off like this but what ur saying just isn\u2019t true and if ur friend really does apparently have the metabolism of like a 6\u20194\u201d weightlifter then she\u2019s an anomaly not a standard ",
