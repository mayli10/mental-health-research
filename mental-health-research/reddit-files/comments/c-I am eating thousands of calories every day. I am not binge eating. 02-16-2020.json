I've dealt with this as well and I completely understand how you feel and all the guilt. The worst thing you can do is go back to your unhealthy coping mechanisms-keep eating and fueling your body because it needs the food. It wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't absolutely necessary. Everyone here wants to see you keep eating and not go back to purging/overexercising.",
