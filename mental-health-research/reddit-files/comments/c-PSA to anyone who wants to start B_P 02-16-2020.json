It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!

It's just a simple blood draw and they should have your results by the next day. \n\nYou won't be forced into treatment unless other factors like being suicidal or being *exceptionally* underweight come into play. I've been having regular draws and pill refills for over a year and the only time inpatient was even brought up was when a doctor miscalculated my BMI as 13 instead of 15. \n\nThey may ask you to go to a regular hospital for IV replacement of fluids/which ever electrolytes you're missing if your levels are dangerously low, however. It can actually help keep you out of inpatient long-term because it'll help keep you medically stable. \n\nYou're free to not tell them you purge, but i think it's best not to be dishonest. if you do have a deficiency they'll suspect it and may ask you pointblank about, and they'll certainly want to know why you're worried about it, and lying could lead to being put on the wrong drug or somesuch issue. \n\nif you have any other questions i'd be happy to answer them if i can!
