Just.... all in all, not a good person, at all. \n\nShe was a tiny little thing and used to go out of her way to make sure it was known that she was the cute one in our friendship. (She actually referred to herself as the cute one. No joke. She made fat jokes about me all the time... I'm 5'7\"... and have always hovered around 135 lbs.) \n\nAnyway, I finally broke away from her towards the end of high school. Now, years and years later, I recently saw her. She has gained a LOT of weight. Like, I didn't even recognize her. \n\nI try to be a good person, and I usually don't judge anyone based on their weight. But that just felt like some kind of karmic reward. ",

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

But I'm thin and pretty so it's the lesser of the evils, as far as I'm concerned. I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion. This is supposed to be a support sub (although it smells from several posts the last few days like there are some fat activist trolls around here). ",

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

That's my thought on it after about 13 or so years of living with mine. \n\nAnyway, I'm not here to try to convince you or anyone else to recover.

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion.

Some think that's worth it. Some (like me) don't. Some never get the chance to find out or choose for themselves. Some are raised to believe they don't have or deserve that choice.\n\nJust because I made that self-congratulatory comment in the context of this post doesn't mean it's my whole opinion on the subject.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

But I'm thin and pretty so it's the lesser of the evils, as far as I'm concerned. I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion.

I was always fat as a kid but one of my best friends was thin and my mom would always tell me I should try to look like this friend and that this friend had the perfect body type (which is such an inappropriate thing to say about a child in the first place, but...). I moved to a new town and the friend and I lost touch over the years. This Christmas when I was at a pretty low point I happened to see her on public transportation and I was shocked that she had gained a pretty significant amount of weight and was now larger than me. Not shocked in a judgmental way but just shocked that this person who represented unachievable thinness and ideal beauty to me had totally subverted that image right in front of me. She was on the phone and still seemed like the happy, bubbly, spirited person I had known as a child, while I\u2019m depressed and anxious and failing at life in general. I recognized her immediately but she didn\u2019t recognize me at all. I didn\u2019t say anything to her but I think about that moment a lot. ",

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

But I'm thin and pretty so it's the lesser of the evils, as far as I'm concerned. I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion. This is supposed to be a support sub (although it smells from several posts the last few days like there are some fat activist trolls around here). ",

I know a lot of them are unhappy because they had children so early. \n\nMany women who have children so early are limited in their career and relationship opportunities through the rest of their lives. Some think that's worth it. Some (like me) don't. Some never get the chance to find out or choose for themselves. Some are raised to believe they don't have or deserve that choice.\n\nJust because I made that self-congratulatory comment in the context of this post doesn't mean it's my whole opinion on the subject. What I said above was a small indulgence. It's more complicated than that, obviously.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion.

But I'm also incredibly lucky to be where I am. It was as much right place right time as hard work and risk taking. And most importantly, brilliant, generous mentors. So much of my success is because of things outside myself.\n\nNow I'm at an age and place where I can try to give that back to a new generation of women, and it is immensely gratifying to give to other people what was given to me.\n\nI sometimes feel superior to those who made my life difficult when I was younger, but it's a fleeting, unsatisfying, unproductive indulgence. I am not better than them, I am just so fucked up that those small moments of feeling superior are something I cling to when they surface because I mostly hate myself.\n\nPlease don't feel like you're not awesome. You're capable of all the things I am, I have no doubt. ",

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help.

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion. This is supposed to be a support sub (although it smells from several posts the last few days like there are some fat activist trolls around here). ",

Of course happiness isn't attainable within recovery if your definition of happiness includes being as skinny as physically possible. True happiness is absolutely attainable if it's defined in other ways that are meaningful for you (quality time with loved ones, career building, etc.).\n\nIdk, I hope this doesn't read as condescending. I've been in recovery for a hot minute now and sometimes I just want to share a little bit of a different perspective especially when I see stuff like this that I used to relate to so much.\n\nTake care.",

Some think that's worth it. Some (like me) don't. Some never get the chance to find out or choose for themselves. Some are raised to believe they don't have or deserve that choice.\n\nJust because I made that self-congratulatory comment in the context of this post doesn't mean it's my whole opinion on the subject.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion. This is supposed to be a support sub (although it smells from several posts the last few days like there are some fat activist trolls around here). ",

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion.

That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

But I'm thin and pretty so it's the lesser of the evils, as far as I'm concerned. I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion. This is supposed to be a support sub (although it smells from several posts the last few days like there are some fat activist trolls around here). ",

I know a lot of them are unhappy because they had children so early. \n\nMany women who have children so early are limited in their career and relationship opportunities through the rest of their lives. Some think that's worth it. Some (like me) don't. Some never get the chance to find out or choose for themselves. Some are raised to believe they don't have or deserve that choice.\n\nJust because I made that self-congratulatory comment in the context of this post doesn't mean it's my whole opinion on the subject.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion.

So much of my success is because of things outside myself.\n\nNow I'm at an age and place where I can try to give that back to a new generation of women, and it is immensely gratifying to give to other people what was given to me.\n\nI sometimes feel superior to those who made my life difficult when I was younger, but it's a fleeting, unsatisfying, unproductive indulgence. I am not better than them, I am just so fucked up that those small moments of feeling superior are something I cling to when they surface because I mostly hate myself.\n\nPlease don't feel like you're not awesome.

Some think that's worth it. Some (like me) don't. Some never get the chance to find out or choose for themselves.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help.

But I'm thin and pretty so it's the lesser of the evils, as far as I'm concerned. I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion. This is supposed to be a support sub (although it smells from several posts the last few days like there are some fat activist trolls around here). ",

I know a lot of them are unhappy because they had children so early. \n\nMany women who have children so early are limited in their career and relationship opportunities through the rest of their lives. Some think that's worth it. Some (like me) don't. Some never get the chance to find out or choose for themselves. Some are raised to believe they don't have or deserve that choice.\n\nJust because I made that self-congratulatory comment in the context of this post doesn't mean it's my whole opinion on the subject. What I said above was a small indulgence. It's more complicated than that, obviously.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion.

So much of my success is because of things outside myself.\n\nNow I'm at an age and place where I can try to give that back to a new generation of women, and it is immensely gratifying to give to other people what was given to me.\n\nI sometimes feel superior to those who made my life difficult when I was younger, but it's a fleeting, unsatisfying, unproductive indulgence. I am not better than them, I am just so fucked up that those small moments of feeling superior are something I cling to when they surface because I mostly hate myself.\n\nPlease don't feel like you're not awesome.

Some think that's worth it. Some (like me) don't. Some never get the chance to find out or choose for themselves.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help.

I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion.

I get that you\u2019re typing these to justify your reason for saying what you said, but it still equates to the whole thing of skinny=good and desirable, fat=bad and disgusting. That\u2019s the mindset that landed most of us here in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s actually funny that you mention the cow thing. I too was called a cow, not for a whole day, but for a whole term (plus the mooing). And when the term ended, they stopped. Because the next term I was a pig. I was also not overweight and that started my b/p experience. Over time I have learnt to stop purging because it feels horrible and I am terrified of the health impacts, but the binging remains. And each time I look in the mirror I hate that I have become what they teased me about. \n\nSo when I see comments like yours (and many in this thread) that basically describe becoming fat as the universe\u2019s way of punishing bullies, that fatness is so bad that it\u2019s a punishment, that although you\u2019re still suffering the horror of an ED but _thank heavens, at least I\u2019m not fat_, it doesn\u2019t help. It makes me feel worse. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from. Seeing that in a safe space at my lowest point...damn. ",

But I'm thin and pretty so it's the lesser of the evils, as far as I'm concerned. I would like to be maybe 5lbs lighter, but as long as I don't get bigger I'll be ok.\n\nI'm not happy every day, but overall I'm good with myself. Yes, I'm a little underweight. Yes, I'm probably shortening my life. Yes, I'm happier indulging my vanity and finding comfort in compulsive restriction than \"recovering\".\n\nThat compromise might not work for everyone, but your downvotes aren't fair. You and I are as allowed to prioritize being thin and pretty as much as anyone else here is allowed to prioritize being fat and recovered. Neither opinion is worthy of downvoting to oblivion. This is supposed to be a support sub (although it smells from several posts the last few days like there are some fat activist trolls around here). ",
