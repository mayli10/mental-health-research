Part of me understands that I have an ED, but another part thinks I'm just vain,  weak and running back to my coping mechanisms so I can have something to hold onto. I feel like I used it as a weapon too, a weapon of defense, but also protection and comfort. I realized that the way you feel is apart of this disorder though, and you're not fake for having your illness manifest in a different way than others. There's so much to EDs. You, me, and everyone else struggling is just as real as any other sufferer and that's why we can come together and relate to these posts, and this beautiful poem. \ud83d\udc95",
