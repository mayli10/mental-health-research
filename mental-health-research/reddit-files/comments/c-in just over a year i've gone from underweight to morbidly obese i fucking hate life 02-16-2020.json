I used to just live with the hunger and restrict hard but I've just lost the willpower to restrict. I have no idea how to eat anymore, and I have no idea how to lose all this weight, even with the fact ive already done it once (I went from average kid, to obese 15 year old, to skinny 18 year old and back up to obese 20 year old)",

I am not saying that I fasted so I can lose weight but everything you do is about losing weight when you have an eating disorder. During my first Ramadan that resulted in lots of binging, I was 12 and trying to lose weight. I didn't even know what was binging but the moment my fast was over I couldn't leave in front of the fridge. \n\nScientifically, when the sugar levels in your blood get low you have a lot more tendency to jump into fast food. You need to eat when you feel the hunger, this is the phase you have control over. Starving yourself for hours generally leads to binging on junk food. \n\nI know that it has benefits and I have healthy friends that practice fasting, but it's not a suitable way of eating someone with ED. Because for us fasting means restricting and restricting means binging later on.",

My mom went from bulimia (binging and purging through compulsive exercise or ridiculous calorie restriction) to BED. She has a normal BMI, but she also has an autoimmune disease, and her regular binges have a massive impact on her health. I used to suffer from BED myself, and I only stopped binging when I went full on into anorexia. I sometimes don't feel like I fit in because my BMI is normal. I have never actually been classified as underweight (I used to be overweight) but I still suffered from health problems related to starvation. This includes my ability to feel hunger. I only sometimes feel the sensation of hunger. Until recently, I have been eating normally (1200-2000 cals per day). Now I want to starve again and idk what to do anymore.

I know that it sounds ridiculous to you now but fasting will only make you gain more weight. There is only one thing you need to focus on now and it is your psychology. You need to find why you have an eating disorder, you need to see a therapist. If you don't get into the roots of the disorder it will be hard to recover. Please prioritize yourself. You are loved, no matter your weight.\n\nAs for eating, I recovered because I ditched all the diets. I ate whatever my body wanted, not my appetite. Sometimes your body wants to eat sugar, chocolate, french fries etc and its good. You need to learn how to eat intuitively. Because often our body wants to eat greens, fruits and healthy stuff. There is a TED Talk by a dietician called Eve Lahijani who teaches this, it helped me a lot.\n\nPlease take your time, please be kind to yourself.",

                "Text": "As others have said, you certainly 100% are welcome here. I\u2019ve gone through a similar experience myself. Though I was never underweight, about 8 years ago I got down to a BMI of about ~19 after heavily restricting. Fast forward to today, I weigh almost exactly twice of what I did then due to binge eating disorder. Actually, I just calculated my current BMI and get this.... it is exactly 38 too (guess I could\u2019ve calculated 19x2 easily!)\n\nAs a couple other people brought up - I highly recommend Brain over Binge. I think I might have a different version than most - mine is titled \u201cThe Brain over Binge Recovery Guide\u201d by Kathryn Hansen. Your comment  \u201cMy stupid head just told me to eat them and snap they\u2019re gone\u201d is exactly how I\u2019d describe my binges. The book discusses the why of this, how urges to binge develop for 2 reasons - survival instincts (dieting) and habit (conditioning). It was obvious to me my binge eating developed after prolonged restriction, but once I began eating sufficient calories again, I couldn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t stop binge eating every. single. day. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to beat yourself up thinking it is a lack of willpower, but this book helped me look at my binge eating in a different light. It describes your binge urges as a function of a temporary brain-wiring problem/an expression of primal wanting which explains \u201cwhy you have this inner dissonance\u201d and discusses the \u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d brain. It then goes on to discuss what is required for recovery, and one part was to stop dieting/restricting/fasting, which i know is really hard when all you want is desperately to lose weight, but you truly can\u2019t overcome BED and diet in an attempt to lose weight at the same time. \n\nAlrighty this comment is already way too long, but I definitely recommend giving the book a shot. BED is rough, and it took me maybe 7 years(?) to view it as an eating disorder and not me just being some wild pig with 0 self control. Hang in there <3",

I am not saying that I fasted so I can lose weight but everything you do is about losing weight when you have an eating disorder. During my first Ramadan that resulted in lots of binging, I was 12 and trying to lose weight. I didn't even know what was binging but the moment my fast was over I couldn't leave in front of the fridge. \n\nScientifically, when the sugar levels in your blood get low you have a lot more tendency to jump into fast food. You need to eat when you feel the hunger, this is the phase you have control over. Starving yourself for hours generally leads to binging on junk food. \n\nI know that it has benefits and I have healthy friends that practice fasting, but it's not a suitable way of eating someone with ED.

Going from restricting heavily as an anorexic to breaking and binging, but not being able to stop because your body has not learned to stop needing the binges.

You have to stop fasting or restricting completely. Start eating, genuinely eating, set meal times, I promise it\u2019ll get better. \n\nI promise you will lose the weight and find your set point weight (your body\u2019s happy weight), you\u2019ll start craving healthier food, you\u2019ll stop binging, you\u2019ll distract yourself with other things.

                "Text": "First off, give yourself a fucking break. Stop being so crazy hard on yourself. That is what leads to being under/overweight. You're ready to fix this once and for all, I can feel the frustration through my monitor. The weight will sort itself out as a bi-product of focusing on health. A healthy mind, and a focus on nutrition will inevitably lead to you finding your natural set point. Every single serial restrictor goes through a binge phase in recovery. I think this is the biggest barrier to recovery; This feeling of a lack of control. Acknowledge these different dialogues in your brain - there's the actual real hunger voice talking to you, and there's this other voice that is the deprived, starved, fear of famine voice that screams at you, even when you've eaten and not physically hungry. In order to get this famine voice to STFU once and for all, you have to train it to know that you are OK, food is coming, and it doesn't need to be so scared and frightened. The worst thing you can do post-binge, is to restrict - because again, you're fuelling the famine voice. My assumption is that you're not spreading your meals out throughout the day (or have a routine in place of regular eating). If you're not eating enough at certain times (e.g. saving all your calories for the evening), then you are still fuelling the famine voice. This is why so many people reach a normal+ weight - because periods of deprivation still exist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my advice would be to do away with calories and diets for now, and focus your heart and soul into being that person you really want to be. Someone that eats normal meals, at normal times and regularly - not too indulgent and not too healthy. Give in a little too, don't go for 'safe' options all the time. Take your time doing all this. This non-dieting way will 100% lead to weight loss as a result of regular eating (body not making your mind rebel and binge, and absence of binge = absence of weight gain). Take this route, take this pace and eliminate this mental turmoil.  Don't do anything you've tried before (quick fixes lead to massive binges). What your poor soul and wellbeing needs right now is some kindness and some stability.",

I am not saying that I fasted so I can lose weight but everything you do is about losing weight when you have an eating disorder. During my first Ramadan that resulted in lots of binging, I was 12 and trying to lose weight. I didn't even know what was binging but the moment my fast was over I couldn't leave in front of the fridge. \n\nScientifically, when the sugar levels in your blood get low you have a lot more tendency to jump into fast food. You need to eat when you feel the hunger, this is the phase you have control over. Starving yourself for hours generally leads to binging on junk food. \n\nI know that it has benefits and I have healthy friends that practice fasting, but it's not a suitable way of eating someone with ED.

                "Text": "I'm dealing with this too. A big part of it for me is that drinking less water makes me feel more hungry and the less nutrient dense the food is, the less likely your body will be properly satiated, even if you've had more than enough calories. I know exactly what to do to lose weight, I'm 40 pounds up from my lowest and I'm borderline obese (5 pounds away). My clothes don't fit and I don't even recognize my body in the mirror and I always underestimate how big I really am when I finally break down and buy new clothes for my new, fat body. It's summer and I have no clothes that fit other than cover alls like sweat pants. I'm planning a trip to McDonald's right now. I'm spending money we don't have on food I don't need that I'm just going to hate myself for eating. I feel so disgusting, greedy and pathetic. /: I'm sorry you're dealing with this too. Ultimately, I hear that binge eating is actually the most common eating disorder. And presuming you're around my age (going on 24) you have your whole life to turn it all around. I'm sorry for my dismal rant of self pity and I don't mean to come off as cynical or despairing but that's truly how I feel sometimes. I just have to remind myself that ultimately, I don't really have that much weight to lose, and I don't have to crash diet, either. We can make slow changes every single day and we'll get better. I truly hope things get better for you. Again, sorry if my post was depressing or didn't help. I started ranting a bit bc I'm struggling today. I don't mean to be toxic. Hugs.\u2764",

I know this is hard to do and probably not what you want to hear, but my recommendation is that if you do binge, the next day, just act like it never happened and eat as normally as possible. The nanosecond I tell myself I'm going to fast or restrict to make up for a binge, I want to binge all over. So when I stopped fasting and restricting, eventually (not immediately, which is what makes this really difficult), the binging stopped, and while I don't consider myself recovered by any means, I'm eating pretty normally and starting to lose some weight as well. Good luck and take care of yourself <3",

I am not saying that I fasted so I can lose weight but everything you do is about losing weight when you have an eating disorder. During my first Ramadan that resulted in lots of binging, I was 12 and trying to lose weight. I didn't even know what was binging but the moment my fast was over I couldn't leave in front of the fridge. \n\nScientifically, when the sugar levels in your blood get low you have a lot more tendency to jump into fast food. You need to eat when you feel the hunger, this is the phase you have control over. Starving yourself for hours generally leads to binging on junk food. \n\nI know that it has benefits and I have healthy friends that practice fasting, but it's not a suitable way of eating someone with ED. Because for us fasting means restricting and restricting means binging later on.",
