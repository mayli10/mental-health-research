Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Even if someone with EDNOS or a different eating disorder eventually did reach a goal of being underweight, it's absolutely safe to assume they'd be so disordered at that point they wouldn't *freely* binge. People with anorexia binge but they don't do it willingly, with excitement, with no guilt, in the way the OP frames it.

Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Even if someone with EDNOS or a different eating disorder eventually did reach a goal of being underweight, it's absolutely safe to assume they'd be so disordered at that point they wouldn't *freely* binge. People with anorexia binge but they don't do it willingly, with excitement, with no guilt, in the way the OP frames it.

Even if someone with EDNOS or a different eating disorder eventually did reach a goal of being underweight, it's absolutely safe to assume they'd be so disordered at that point they wouldn't *freely* binge. People with anorexia binge but they don't do it willingly, with excitement, with no guilt, in the way the OP frames it. It's a naive post that frames anorexia as a temporary diet instead of something that has a chance of ruining food forever.",

Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Sorry. \nOriginal text : Yeah I know it's weird but my eating disorder is about a LOT of different shit and part of one of my many complexes about eating comes from the remarks my family would make (esp after finding out about my ed). They would tell me that I was a waste of food and disgusting and that always made me wonder how small I needed to be to deserve food. I had been shamed for eating for so long I almost started to be jealous of the other ppl with Ed's on mpa and the like saying that their families would force them to eat and I would fantasize about someone wanting me to eat- someone thinking I was worth eating. The longest I fasted was 14 fucking days and it's just hilarious how some people would complain about having to eat dinner with their families every night. Like, I know it sucks to have to eat when you're just gonna have to purge it or bust your ass to burn it off and I'm really not trying to sound like an invalidating asshole although I'm sure that's how I'm coming across. I'm just saying that at that point in my life i really could have just fallen down in a ditch and died and it wouldn't have mattered and I just always felt frustrated and jealous. Sorry I ranted so much. I've been struggling a lot lately.\nTldr: some people are shamed for eating a lot, typically if you're small people think it's cool, etc. I want to be good enough/small enough/strong enough to deserve food.",

Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet.

Even if someone with EDNOS or a different eating disorder eventually did reach a goal of being underweight, it's absolutely safe to assume they'd be so disordered at that point they wouldn't *freely* binge. People with anorexia binge but they don't do it willingly, with excitement, with no guilt, in the way the OP frames it.

Even if someone with EDNOS or a different eating disorder eventually did reach a goal of being underweight, it's absolutely safe to assume they'd be so disordered at that point they wouldn't *freely* binge. People with anorexia binge but they don't do it willingly, with excitement, with no guilt, in the way the OP frames it. It's a naive post that frames anorexia as a temporary diet instead of something that has a chance of ruining food forever.",

                        "Text": "Food deprivation changes the way our bodies metabolize nutrients. Insulin is a hormone that breaks down sugar from carbs. When ya don\u2019t eat carbs, insulin slows. Without carbs, the body breaks down carbs, fats, etc. This change depletes electrolyte stores. When we start eating again there\u2019s a shift from fat metabolism back to carbs. So your insulin goes up. Generally, your electrolytes are needed to convert glucose to energy.\n\nWhen I was in treatment 15 ish years ago I was sneaking carbs because they start you on a no carb diet. I got into the muffin stash and promptly had a heart attack.",
