I love the \"safe\" foods though. I have been trying to find foods that have some sort of health merit and that I enjoy, but I will not binge on. Definitely not perfect foods by any means, but things like yogurt, non-sugary cereal (even if it is technically sugary, like special K), peanut butter crackers, etc. I know they will fill me up and satisfy me so that I won't eat too much or feel deprived.",

A lot of food just tastes like cardboard to me unless I\u2019m binging. I\u2019m home a lot. Processed cookies, I eat a sleeve. Any time of the day. How do I track my binges. I want these things but not in large doses. I tried to force myself to make cookies (no more prepared cookies) but I just eat all the chocolate chips. Like half a bag and I don\u2019t like them. I know I binge when I\u2019m alone that is something that will happen.  At least a 3 hour span of me alone. I want it to end. ",

What i eat and how much, where I am, if I purged, and my feelings when eating it. That kind of helps me take a step back and look at each day in terms of how I feel when I eat and which contexts I usually binge and which contexts I usually feel okay. If you stick to it, you can have some insight into when you\u2019re afraid you\u2019re gonna binge or that you will binge, which can late help you feel more comfortable that you won\u2019t binge if you put yourself into the same contexts where you felt okay. \n\nHope what I said makes sense, I\u2019m sick and I\u2019m half asleep Hahahaha ",
