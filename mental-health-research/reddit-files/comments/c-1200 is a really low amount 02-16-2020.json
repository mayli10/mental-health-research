Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

                        "Text": "I've definitely felt tired/undernourished/dizzy eating as low as 1400 calories a day when I ate specific but arbitrarily selected things (just ground beef and tortillas was my last diet) but once I chose a food with vitamins and stopped worrying about taste, I stopped having those issues even at around 900 calories. I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

                        "Text": "I've definitely felt tired/undernourished/dizzy eating as low as 1400 calories a day when I ate specific but arbitrarily selected things (just ground beef and tortillas was my last diet) but once I chose a food with vitamins and stopped worrying about taste, I stopped having those issues even at around 900 calories. I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal.

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I had previously thought I was some kind of food addict with no willpower - I wasn\u2019t, I was starving. \n\nOther important things: BMR is different than TDEE and particularly if you are active those can be quite different. And the average amount of calories recommended on google/fitness trackers, etc. may underestimate your needs. (and I\u2019m not underweight but fairly short and at the low end of normal BMI where people say they think those calculators overestimate). From seeing other people in treatment I know it\u2019s not just me. Idk. I see people taking offense but god if I had known several years ago how much I could eat at maintenance I may have never developed these habits in the first place. ",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal.

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t be upset or feel uncomfortable with one or\neven all of those things, i\u2019m just recommending to keep and eye on yourself and not let yourself fall into an echo chamber.

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

                        "Text": "I've definitely felt tired/undernourished/dizzy eating as low as 1400 calories a day when I ate specific but arbitrarily selected things (just ground beef and tortillas was my last diet) but once I chose a food with vitamins and stopped worrying about taste, I stopped having those issues even at around 900 calories. I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

                        "Text": "I've definitely felt tired/undernourished/dizzy eating as low as 1400 calories a day when I ate specific but arbitrarily selected things (just ground beef and tortillas was my last diet) but once I chose a food with vitamins and stopped worrying about taste, I stopped having those issues even at around 900 calories. I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

                "Text": "To me the question is not about whether 1200 is \"plenty\" in the sense of \"being sufficient to permit necessary nutrient intake and maintain weight\". The question is, what is metabolically and mentally healthy (the two are tied together).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you exist in a state of constantly feeling physically deprived of food to the point where you show all the classical signs of a restrictive eating disorder, such as, feeling the overwhelming need to control your body weight, intentionally ignoring physical hunger, food obsession, scale obsession, AND you show physical symptoms of metabolic adaptation, low T3, low body temperature, amenorrhea, constipation, persistent fatigue or lack of energy, dry skin, hair/skin problems, abnormal sensitivity to cold temperatures, etc... you may be maintaining your weight, but there is no way that you are at an optimal weight, body composition, and calorie intake, there is no way you are performing optimally athletically, and it is unlikely that you are in a sustainable state physically or mentally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWeight maintenance itself is not evidence that you are at an appropriate intake level and objectively physically healthy. Health is more than a number on a scale and a routine blood test showing your cholesterol and HbA1c are normal. Two women in my life, same height, roughly the same intake, different genetics, very different builds, very different overall activity levels. One is the classical \"ectomorph\" (yes, I know somatotypes are BS) who leads an inactive lifestyle and has a naturally low appetite, also has a low TDEE and a normal relationship with food. The other exercises regularly and \"has to intermittent fast and save calories for the evening because I can't sleep when I'm hungry\", has chronically low body temp, and is constantly focused on food and gets visibly angry when mealtimes are delayed for any reason. This person also has a history of chronic dieting and unsurprisingly carries much more body fat than the other person. Diet history has a huge impact on your TDEE. Reverse dieting and adding body fat to your body does wonders, as anyone who has recovered from an eating disorder can attest. Metabolic adaptation is an extremely powerful force that turns calorie math on its head. Read this study which shows that mitigating metabolic adaptation is actually more important than energy restriction alone for weight loss, if you don't believe me: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925405](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925405)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think most of the delusional people on /r/1200isplenty and other subs confound the fact that we live in an obesogenic environment with a strict need to implement unnecessary diet strategies, none of which are inherently disordered in and of themselves, like fasting, intermittent fasting, ketosis, low carb, veganism (for dietary rather than ethical reasons), etc. There is no silver bullet for weight maintenance. Successful weight maintainers with a healthy body composition do share some qualities, but none of them have anything to do with diet structure or composition. They monitor themselves, they moderate themselves, they exercise, and they use a diet system that is habitual. Willpower is a finite resource that is not part of the equation. Lots of subreddits around here celebrate the intentional use of willpower to manipulate body composition, and when this isn't done with a specific goal in mind (ie, I want to prep for a bodybuilding show, or, I want to lose excessive body fat to improve my health), it often leads to a disordered relationship with food.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I have it set at a 1000 calorie deficit, so even I stayed in bed all day, I\u2019d still have a 500 calorie deficit and lose a pound a week on that diet. If you\u2019re small and inactive maybe you can maintain, but unless you\u2019re very short, you\u2019re probably underweight if your TDEE is 1200 and you\u2019re still going to feel like shit eating maintenance.",

I'm literally sitting in a hospital bed all day, getting tube-fed around 800kcal in addition to eating 3 small meals, and it's not enough to gain yet (they're increasing slowly due to the risk of refeeding). Every single thing your body does requires energy; breathing, digesting, thinking... and the less energy that goes in, the less comes out. Science!",

I was convinced for a long time that 1200 was THE number for me, despite logic, despite being 5\u2019 8\u201d and very active. \n\nGetting that number out of my head and trying to eat around 2000 has been such a difficult thing after being on Reddit this long. People say the government brainwashed people into believing 2000 was appropriate, but Reddit has brainwashed everyone into thinking 1200 is.\n\nTrust your TDEE, everyone!",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I think people forget that it isn\u2019t normal to feel so shitty and bad around eating. \n\nA lot of the time we want to think that a lesser amount is enough, or our bodies are different because we gain on some low intake number. In my experience if you start eating regularly again (2000+, or + a lot if you are refeeding) that number will certainly make you lose weight when your metabolism is going again\n\nI feel like I\u2019ll get downvoted on this but I think we often don\u2019t realize that this eating disordered mentality is not necessarily reality. When I first got sick I had no idea what I was doing wasn\u2019t normal. ",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

                        "Text": "I've definitely felt tired/undernourished/dizzy eating as low as 1400 calories a day when I ate specific but arbitrarily selected things (just ground beef and tortillas was my last diet) but once I chose a food with vitamins and stopped worrying about taste, I stopped having those issues even at around 900 calories. I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

                        "Text": "I've definitely felt tired/undernourished/dizzy eating as low as 1400 calories a day when I ate specific but arbitrarily selected things (just ground beef and tortillas was my last diet) but once I chose a food with vitamins and stopped worrying about taste, I stopped having those issues even at around 900 calories. I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

Your example grandma was a pretty extreme case - I\u2019m not quite that bad, though I\u2019m probably older that 99% of people on this sub. 1200 puts me at a deficit of 100 kcal or less, so right now, it\u2019s pretty much maintenance for me. BUT I also know if I were more active or had more muscle mass my TDEE would increase and 1200 would be a significant deficit. \n\nI think this is really important though:\n     \u201cI don't want people to feel like something is wrong with them if they feel really crappy at that amount. Most people feel crappy eating 1200 a day, and that's normal. Even if you're not losing more weight at that level, it's normal to feel hungry, be easily triggered to binge, etc. at that amount.\u201d",

I definitely feel hungry day to day, but never feel guilty about that.\n\nI think irrational fear of hunger is the reason why there is an obesity epidemic currently. Hunger is not the end of the world, and losing weight without ever feeling hungry... I feel like its a strange goal. Not impossible, but riskier for those who struggle with BED.\n\nI understand there is also risks associated with eating too little, and would encourage anyone who ever feels light-headed while standing up to definitely reconsider their diet, but advising everyone to just \"eat more\" without consideration for *what* they are eating is also dangerous, if not more so. Not all calories are created equal. I find minimum calorie numbers as advice to be silly for this reason.",
