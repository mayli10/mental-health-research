This subreddit has really helped me see that eating disorders don\u2019t just manifest as one set illness\u2014people develop binging problems during restriction or after recovery, purging isn\u2019t just bulimia, etc. I always felt really weird about having EDNOS/\u201cdisordered eating\u201d because I have never been below a middle of healthy BMI weight. But it\u2019s a mental illness. And if you start fat (like I did) you can develop real health problems before you\u2019re underweight. So yeah AA is a useful label for treatment. People who don\u2019t have EDs and aren\u2019t mental health professionals don\u2019t get it",

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

For what it's worth, I was seething on here a while back about how much the world encourages thinness at all costs.\n\nAnd some cool person popped up and replied like - \"which people, though?\"\n\nAt the time, I was kinda like \"fucking everyone, probably, idfk\". But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

That's just not how fatpeoplehate 2.0 works.",

For what it's worth, I was seething on here a while back about how much the world encourages thinness at all costs.\n\nAnd some cool person popped up and replied like - \"which people, though?\"\n\nAt the time, I was kinda like \"fucking everyone, probably, idfk\". But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

For what it's worth, I was seething on here a while back about how much the world encourages thinness at all costs.\n\nAnd some cool person popped up and replied like - \"which people, though?\"\n\nAt the time, I was kinda like \"fucking everyone, probably, idfk\". But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

For what it's worth, I was seething on here a while back about how much the world encourages thinness at all costs.\n\nAnd some cool person popped up and replied like - \"which people, though?\"\n\nAt the time, I was kinda like \"fucking everyone, probably, idfk\". But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery. Not okay, and completely ignorant to how complicated eating disorders are.",

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars.

It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery. Not okay, and completely ignorant to how complicated eating disorders are.",

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

For what it's worth, I was seething on here a while back about how much the world encourages thinness at all costs.\n\nAnd some cool person popped up and replied like - \"which people, though?\"\n\nAt the time, I was kinda like \"fucking everyone, probably, idfk\". But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

For what it's worth, I was seething on here a while back about how much the world encourages thinness at all costs.\n\nAnd some cool person popped up and replied like - \"which people, though?\"\n\nAt the time, I was kinda like \"fucking everyone, probably, idfk\". But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

No one cared because I was fat. Even now people don\u2019t care and push me to lose weight. The only difference is they say to do it \u201chealthily\u201d and then proceed to give me some bullshit diet tips. I gained back almost half of what I lost in about 3 months of inpatient, so I always get the vibe that people think I was just faking it. That you can\u2019t be fat and also anorexic.

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery. Not okay, and completely ignorant to how complicated eating disorders are.",

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve.

Back when I followed the sub, I appreciated that they cut through all the noise and myth and misinformation that surrounds why the general public doesn't lose weight, because it comes down to what everyone in this sub knows better than anyone, even if we overuse it. Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery. Not okay, and completely ignorant to how complicated eating disorders are.",

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.

                "Text": "I'd like to clear some things up. Since I have a degree in nutrition and I'm studying for the national exam to become a dietitian, I thought I'd chime in here. \n\nI don't mean to invalidate anyone's legitimate health concerns coming from their eating disorder. Yes, it is absolutely possible to suffer the effects of malnutrition at any weight. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies (including electrolyte imbalances) can occur in anyone regardless of BMI or body fat percentage. Yes, those with eating disorders at any size may suffer severe mental and emotional torment. \nHowever, the severity scale for anorexia had and still has valid reasoning in terms of necessary level of treatment. Extremely low BMIs generally indicate *both* a dramatic loss of body fat and muscle tissue.  \n\nThese people are far more likely to be at risk for\n low bone density and osteoporosis, \nmajor organ failure including greater likelihood of GI damage (the stomach is made up of muscle tissue), possibly permanent infertility, a slowed heart rate and possible death from a weakened heart (loss of muscle can include cardiac muscle), and brain damage. \n\nMedical professionals pay special attention to eating disorder sufferers with very low body weight  because the focus is on getting the patient medically stabilized before beginning treatment. Regarding brain damage- as cognition becomes more impaired, the more difficult it is for the patient to engage in therapy, regulate emotions, and have the ability  to work out the root causes of the disorder. Black and white \"all or nothing\" thinking tends to get worse, too. \n\nYou DO NOT want to reach this point. The rate of successfully reaching a full recovery is unfortunately lower than those who begin treatment at a healthy weight range, overweight, or obese.",

But the response stuck with me, and I started looking at the people around me.\n\nDecent people still have their knee-jerk reactions, but most of them try to overcome that. And they're a lot kinder about my weight than I am towards myself. Just like they're probably harsher about their own weight than I would ever be.\n\nIt's easy to pay attention to the people who're cruel, and convince ourselves automatically that their kind counterparts are just well-meaning liars. But I think part of emotional health is working on accepting kindness at face value. And avoiding judgmental nastiness that we don't deserve. The people who do obsess over criticizing others' weight can keep on wasting their time and energy, while we learn to live and thrive.",

Less in, more out. \nBUT I left because I agree with your first point more: they were bullies as well, or rapidly becoming them, and their views on BED and AA were/probably still are fucked up. It enraged me that when a bulimic or anorexic (or really any of us with an ED that makes you look how they expect an ED-sufferer to look) spoke up about our illness, it was all hand-holding and sympathetic \"I hope you get the help you need \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\", but then talked about BED and AA with such scorn and derision and mockery.
