                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                            "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

I guess she is finally starting to lose weight after more than two decades, so I guess that's a good sign for her health. The way she eats there's no reason she should be so big though.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

Neither made it seem *too* awful though. Like maybe on rare occasions they might make a passing comment about it. My mom has problems with her thyroid and put on a bunch of weight during pregnancy because of it. I guess she is finally starting to lose weight after more than two decades, so I guess that's a good sign for her health. The way she eats there's no reason she should be so big though.",

                "Text": "TW: I felt like I should add a trigger warning here, Ive tried to only use releavant information as necessary. \n\nIm studying education psychology at uni (3rd yr) and I had to do a course on youth challenges and development. There was a whole 2 hour lecture on eating disorders that mortified me. Not because of the information, but some of the stereotyped answers given by the students. The moment Im about to talk about is something that legitimately made me realize that what Ive been doing since 13 isn't what people typically do. \n\nMy lecturer was discussing about how eating disorders are not about food, its about control and therefore lack of.  Im not going to discuss anymore than I have to for fear of triggering people but he went on to ask, when these kids feel they cant turn to their friends or parents to talk to about these things, where do they turn to?\n\nNo one in the class could fucking answer it. If there was anyone else in that class who suffered, I applaud them for hiding it so well. Everyone was baffled. A couple of people said, guidance counselors etc. But there was an awkward silence that lasted too long. Im sure at this point you've all guessed what the answer is, because I sure as fuck knew the moment he asked the question, because I do it every day. So I put my hand up, and just said \"online\". Boom. I swear to god, there was an audible \"ooooooooh\". He went on to talk about tumblr and another website that shall not be named. Point being, there is little actual factual information about EDs, so all these students in my class based all their knowledge on AN and BN on what the OP said from a single health class when they were 14.  \n\nIt felt so surreal that the things we do, that seem obvious to us, are not even considered by others.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

There is no romance or glamour here.\n* Binge eating is not the same as eating an extra serving or two of cake. Eating until you think your stomach might explode, while you lay on the bathroom floor covered in sweat, heart pounding out of your chest, wishing you could vomit and hoping that you die, is not fun.\n* Eating disorders are often secretive. Just because you didn't know someone was suffering doesn't mean it didn't happen. If someone opens up to you about their struggles, believe them.\n* Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders .\n* EDNOS is the most common eating disorder and most people don't fit neatly into an AN/BED/BN diagnosis. They still have a valid mental illness and need help.\n* Causes are complex and vary from person to person.\n* You don't have to be underweight to need help. In fact, most people would benefit from getting help far earlier. \n* Recovery is not linear, looks different for everyone, and takes longer than you think. Way longer.\n* Just because someone hates themselves at a certain size doesn't mean they hate other people for being that size or above.\n\nAlso, and I'm not sure how to work this into my list, but I wish people would just shut the fuck up about my physical appearance and what I'm choosing to eat or not eat.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

                        "Text": "Yes, the main issue is nutritional deficiencies, but if you're like me and take a buttload of supplements and focus on your macronutrient ratios then you can get away with eating much less before the physical side effects appear. Last year when I was at my old low weight and not so focused on nutrition I was doing awful. This year I'm just fine even though I'm at a lower weight. Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect. Anorexia is probably the deadliest mental illness there is, but that's not entirely because of people starving to death.",

Well, I did try to purge once after Thanksgiving dinner back in October, but that was mostly because I felt absolutely sick later that night. I just wanted the pain in my stomach to go away. I didn't succeed in purging. I don't seem to have a gag reflex and I think chugging baking soda in water might have actually settled my stomach instead of making me vomit like the Internet said it would. \n\nI have to say that I couldn't really care about my appearance at all.
