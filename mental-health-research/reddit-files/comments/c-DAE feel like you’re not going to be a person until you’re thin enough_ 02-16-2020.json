Then you can figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t, and have nice skin before you reach a point with your weight you\u2019re more comfy with. Healthy skin is not only important for your health, but is also very attractive. You\u2019ll also have at least a routine started so it\u2019ll be easier to continue and less stressful, and you won\u2019t have to deal with any initial peeling, irritation, flaky skin or breakouts as you are experimenting +/ your skin is getting used to it at the same time you\u2019re finally feeling at least a tiny bit better about your body. I\u2019m still not super comfortable with my body but I am more than I was, and having better skin has also made me feel a lot better about my appearance. It also provides some routine and structure, and is enjoyable :) \n\n(Ps if you wanna talk products I would love to hear about the ones you own or are interested !)",

Then you can figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t, and have nice skin before you reach a point with your weight you\u2019re more comfy with. Healthy skin is not only important for your health, but is also very attractive. You\u2019ll also have at least a routine started so it\u2019ll be easier to continue and less stressful, and you won\u2019t have to deal with any initial peeling, irritation, flaky skin or breakouts as you are experimenting +/ your skin is getting used to it at the same time you\u2019re finally feeling at least a tiny bit better about your body. I\u2019m still not super comfortable with my body but I am more than I was, and having better skin has also made me feel a lot better about my appearance. It also provides some routine and structure, and is enjoyable :) \n\n(Ps if you wanna talk products I would love to hear about the ones you own or are interested !)",

Then you can figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t, and have nice skin before you reach a point with your weight you\u2019re more comfy with. Healthy skin is not only important for your health, but is also very attractive. You\u2019ll also have at least a routine started so it\u2019ll be easier to continue and less stressful, and you won\u2019t have to deal with any initial peeling, irritation, flaky skin or breakouts as you are experimenting +/ your skin is getting used to it at the same time you\u2019re finally feeling at least a tiny bit better about your body. I\u2019m still not super comfortable with my body but I am more than I was, and having better skin has also made me feel a lot better about my appearance. It also provides some routine and structure, and is enjoyable :) \n\n(Ps if you wanna talk products I would love to hear about the ones you own or are interested !)",

Then you can figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t, and have nice skin before you reach a point with your weight you\u2019re more comfy with. Healthy skin is not only important for your health, but is also very attractive. You\u2019ll also have at least a routine started so it\u2019ll be easier to continue and less stressful, and you won\u2019t have to deal with any initial peeling, irritation, flaky skin or breakouts as you are experimenting +/ your skin is getting used to it at the same time you\u2019re finally feeling at least a tiny bit better about your body. I\u2019m still not super comfortable with my body but I am more than I was, and having better skin has also made me feel a lot better about my appearance. It also provides some routine and structure, and is enjoyable :) \n\n(Ps if you wanna talk products I would love to hear about the ones you own or are interested !)",

Then you can figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t, and have nice skin before you reach a point with your weight you\u2019re more comfy with. Healthy skin is not only important for your health, but is also very attractive. You\u2019ll also have at least a routine started so it\u2019ll be easier to continue and less stressful, and you won\u2019t have to deal with any initial peeling, irritation, flaky skin or breakouts as you are experimenting +/ your skin is getting used to it at the same time you\u2019re finally feeling at least a tiny bit better about your body. I\u2019m still not super comfortable with my body but I am more than I was, and having better skin has also made me feel a lot better about my appearance. It also provides some routine and structure, and is enjoyable :) \n\n(Ps if you wanna talk products I would love to hear about the ones you own or are interested !)",
