I'm relatively recovered and I still come on here every so often because I think it's crucial to know no one's journey is linear. I just want to help everyone out. ultimately no one is alone in this, it's very important to keep the dialogue going in every aspect of it; good and bad. take care of yourself, reader. <3",
