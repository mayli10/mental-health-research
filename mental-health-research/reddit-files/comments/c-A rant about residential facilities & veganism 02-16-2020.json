I don't eat like that normally it's way too heavy on my stomach. I prefer soups, oats if I have to with no additions, and maybe half a potato if there's no oil.

My meal plan was a lot of veggie burger with bun, toast in the morning with oats which is very heavy, lots of cereals with bread and jam and I swear they gave me potatoes with rice for every dinner or lunch meal. I don't eat like that normally it's way too heavy on my stomach. I prefer soups, oats if I have to with no additions, and maybe half a potato if there's no oil. I just generally speaking don't like eating and prefer to drink my calories which is why I was supplemented.",

I don't eat like that normally it's way too heavy on my stomach. I prefer soups, oats if I have to with no additions, and maybe half a potato if there's no oil.

I don't eat like that normally it's way too heavy on my stomach. I prefer soups, oats if I have to with no additions, and maybe half a potato if there's no oil.

My meal plan was a lot of veggie burger with bun, toast in the morning with oats which is very heavy, lots of cereals with bread and jam and I swear they gave me potatoes with rice for every dinner or lunch meal. I don't eat like that normally it's way too heavy on my stomach. I prefer soups, oats if I have to with no additions, and maybe half a potato if there's no oil. I just generally speaking don't like eating and prefer to drink my calories which is why I was supplemented.",

My meal plan was a lot of veggie burger with bun, toast in the morning with oats which is very heavy, lots of cereals with bread and jam and I swear they gave me potatoes with rice for every dinner or lunch meal. I don't eat like that normally it's way too heavy on my stomach. I prefer soups, oats if I have to with no additions, and maybe half a potato if there's no oil. I just generally speaking don't like eating and prefer to drink my calories which is why I was supplemented.",

Like you said lots of people with eating disorders try and stick to different diets to eat less/hide their disorder from families. You could say you\u2019ve been vegan since before the disorder, but in that case how are they to know that the disorder didn\u2019t stem from being vegan, or if you\u2019ve really been vegan for that long? In terms of trying to get you back up to a healthy weight, it would be more difficult using plant based materials, instead of calorie rich items like meat and cheese. I would maybe suggest trying to find a facility for vegetarianism instead? I know it\u2019s not the same and goes against your morals, but I think that it might be easier to find a clinic that would be more open to vegetarianism than going full vegan. ",

I don't eat like that normally it's way too heavy on my stomach. I prefer soups, oats if I have to with no additions, and maybe half a potato if there's no oil.

They do have your best interests at heart, (just not the best interests of animals).\n\nI\u2019m vegan too, and I truly do have strong ethical qualms regarding the environment and the treatment of animals that preceded my ED by several years. At the same time, I would be lying to myself if I were to say that I don\u2019t also heavily rely on and give additional emotional value to veganism for making restriction much easier and feeling like a way to be in control other than explicitly restricting calories. \n\nThat may not be the case for you at all, but my point is that the facilities are keeping patients like myself in mind because I and others in the same boat make up the majority within the group \u2018anorexic vegans\u2019 and you (assuming that for you it has absolutely nothing to do with calorie restriction or the feeling of control and is purely 100% ethical, which is a very hard distinction to make) would be the minority. \n\nAdditionally, it makes their job of helping you significantly more difficult if they can\u2019t replenish your body with certain nutrients that are found mostly in meat and dairy and if they can\u2019t weight restore you more quickly by feeding you any number of calorie dense and nutrient rich animal products. \n\nWere they to allow veganism, they would have to either:\na) Rely on a majority diet of higher calorie and denser processed vegan junk food (which could cause you to develop binge eating habits, defeating the purpose of treatment by trading one ED for another).\n\nor\n\nb) Feed you an absolutely massive volume of harder to digest + lower calorie vegan foods that would damage your (most likely) barely functioning digestive system.\n\nIn either case they would also have to feed you the same few meals over and over with little variation- which is in itself restrictive eating. If they did this, you would physically be healthier but leave treatment without fixing the underlying issues, essentially treating the symptoms and not the root cause. Then, when you ultimately relapse, as an organization they are liable for not doing their job properly and potentially open to negative public feedback, legal action, budget cuts, etc.\n\nDo you see the issue with claiming they don\u2019t allow it out of ignorance? It\u2019s definitely possible to remain vegan and weight restore yourself- and even to work toward a healthier mindset- but there is good reason that the facilities are making it hard for you to attempt it on their turf. \n\nYour best bet would be to find an outpatient therapist and nutritionist team who work with you and with one another, which is what I did when I quasi-recovered. Had I stuck with them for as long as I should have instead of quitting after gaining the bare minimum, I might not be in this subreddit anymore. \n\nHaving pre-prepared meals to the nutritionist\u2019s specifications delivered to my house by a meal service and knowing that I had to eat them or I would waste a ton of money and food helped me, because I can\u2019t stand to be wasteful. I think this is a commonality among many vegans but I don\u2019t know if it is applicable for you specifically.\n\nDM me if you want further suggestions, because I totally get why you wouldn\u2019t want to go against your morals and make yourself sick! I just don\u2019t think you will find many clinics willing to contend with the afore-mentioned serious problems it would raise.",

There is no deficiency syndrome for carbohydrates and the minimum required intake is likely zero.\n\nHumans are naturally carnivores (having eaten brain and offal of land animals and fish which are high in DHA and EPA for most of evolution - a non-lacto non-ovo vegetarian diet does not naturally contain any of this, nor does it contain much B12), and don't try to convince me otherwise.\n\nYour morals may be interfering with fixing malnutrition. I know not about you, but I'd rather put my health above some religious belief that animals are sacred.\n\nResidential apparently usually makes people higher DEB, so don't do that, please.\n\n#Option 1 - Break your morals\n\nGo out and rent a boat, and get a fishing license. Bring supplies like macadamia nuts, toasted soybeans, coconuts, FORTIFIED nutritional-yeast and so on. BRING SALT, AND WATER - YOU MAY END UP IN KETOSIS IF YOU RESTRICT CARBOHYDRATE (as I suggest) AND KETONES MAKE THE KIDNEYS WASTE SALT LIKE THE NOUVEAU RICHE.\n\nBring chickpeas if being low-carb means you can't eat enough to get a semblance of nutrition.\n\nPick some oblivious large fish up out of the water and put it in a tank on the boat. Then hit it across the neck with a goddamn ice scraper or something sharp enough to decapitate an animal.\n\n#Option 2 - Keep the morals.\n\nYou still need a boat and all the supplies I mentioned in Opt 1 (nuts, beans, coconut, fortified N-yeast for cobalamin), but this time it's to launch yourself off for diving (get a physician to clear you for this one). You're looking for algae, not fish.\n\nThat might be impractical. There are commercially available DHA/EPA supplements derived from microalgae, although I don't know what the prices would be and you'd need to megadose. If you go this route, you don't need a boat, but you DO still need all of the supplies (nuts, beans, coconut, FNY, chickpeas if you find low carb suppresses your appetite too much, salt and water). You'll very much want to add in \n\nYour brain needs nutrients after 15 years of veganism and 12 years of patent anorexia nervosa. You need to refeed slowly because chronic anorexia puts the body in a deeply fasted state, from which a huge bolus of carbs and protein could kill you.\n\nYou also need to live outside (if you successfully avoid omega-6 fats) so you get enough vitamin D3. I am not kidding about this. If you don't practically live outside in a UV-transparent tent, you will not get any cholecalciferol because you won't get any in a diet lacking meat, and cholecalciferol deficiency causes rickets. You don't want rickets on top of anorexia and managing a slow refeed.",
