There is silver lining in everything\n\n\n2) I am going through a similar situation right now:  got a break-up phone call on Wednesday night ( what's up with men unable to stand up and tell this shit to our faces?!?!).  I threw a \"hail mary\" speech and talked him out of it, but the relationship is super-tense right now and feels all sorts of unconfortable/unstable.  I am stressed out, heart-broken and miserable - not really hungry and cannot keep food down anyway. And yes, there is this part of me that just loves jumping on the scale every morning to see yet another 1/2 - 3/4 lbs gone overnight. ",
