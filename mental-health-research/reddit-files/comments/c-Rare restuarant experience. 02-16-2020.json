And then you sit by yourself and eat without a single verbal exchange. \n\nThat's my dream. If they opened one here, I would be the happiest person in the world. Social interactions and food are just too much sometimes! ",

Other people always find a way to ruin it. \n\n\n\nTonight I was trying to eat ONE fucking brownie bite, but my mom always asks me 50 fucking questions when my mouth is full. I give her the dirty look, point to my mouth cause she knows I can't fucking stand when she does that, and like a bitch she says \"oh I can't remember all your stupid food rules\"\nI don't have stupid goddamn food rules!!! I just don't want to be forced to talk with my fucking mouth full!!! Fuck this makes me madder than anything. I can't remember HER stupid fucking rules like keeping every single door shut cause she thinks my toddler is going to go drown herself in the toilet. \n\nSorry to rant on your post but I'm still so mad right now.
