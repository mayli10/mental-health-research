                            "Text": "Thank you so much for your comment! Ever since raising my calories to 1800 after doing 1300-1500 a day for so long while being very active (walking an average of 14k steps a day and going to the gym 4 days a week for a little over an hour with a focus on strength training) I've had a binge about once a week. The extra food definitely has me more lenient with myself, which is a positive thing.  I've been good for a few weeks to not restrict after my binges and to hit my 1800 calorie goal, despite so desperately wanting to fast track my weight resetting. I'm 5'8.5 and before Saturday's binge around 125lbs. This morning I was just under 130 and I almost never get that high so I feel like the binges are catching up to me since I'm not restricting. I know my body needs food though ): being this skinny has been really hard on me, but it's so hard to accept weight gain. I don't want to lose my abs as shallow as it is \ud83d\ude2d",

Ever since raising my calories to 1800 after doing 1300-1500 a day for so long while being very active (walking an average of 14k steps a day and going to the gym 4 days a week for a little over an hour with a focus on strength training) I've had a binge about once a week. The extra food definitely has me more lenient with myself, which is a positive thing.  I've been good for a few weeks to not restrict after my binges and to hit my 1800 calorie goal, despite so desperately wanting to fast track my weight resetting. I'm 5'8.5 and before Saturday's binge around 125lbs. This morning I was just under 130 and I almost never get that high so I feel like the binges are catching up to me since I'm not restricting. I know my body needs food though ): being this skinny has been really hard on me, but it's so hard to accept weight gain. I don't want to lose my abs as shallow as it is \ud83d\ude2d",
