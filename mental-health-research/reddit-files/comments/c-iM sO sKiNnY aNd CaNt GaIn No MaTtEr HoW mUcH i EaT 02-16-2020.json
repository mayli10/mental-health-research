You get a shiny new ride and if you push it to the max all the time it'll eventually give out and be put in the scrap yard.

It can happen to people who are even in good shape and that's what's scary about it. That's why older people worry about it. The pancreas has to be treated like an engine just like your heart. You get a shiny new ride and if you push it to the max all the time it'll eventually give out and be put in the scrap yard. But if you take it easy on the engine and keep it maintained, it'll last much longer.",
