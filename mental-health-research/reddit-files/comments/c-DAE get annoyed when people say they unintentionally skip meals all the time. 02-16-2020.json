For example, I'll definitely think about what I want to eat but then decide to paint my nails until I figure out what it is I want to eat. And we all know there is never such a thing as \"painting my nails real quick\". While painting my nails I get a \"lunch? :)\" text from my guy so I tell him about my current disability (wet nails) and say \"90 minutes from now work with you? Still have to get ready.\" 2 hours have passed since I first wanted to eat something. Now I'm in the passenger seat of my guys car. Neither of us know what we want to eat. He tells me \"I need to run to the post office real quick then to Walmart while we decide on what to eat.\" 3 hours have now passed. Then I get a text from my mom \"Can you pick up your sister today? Dr's appointment is taking longer than expected.\" So I go and get my sister and now it's been 5 hours. Lunch is in the past and dinner time is approaching. I've unintentionally skipped a meal.",
