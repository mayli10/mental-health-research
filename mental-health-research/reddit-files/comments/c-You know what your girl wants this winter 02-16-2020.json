I have to admit I didn\u2019t see the shitpost tag (that would\u2019ve changed the way I reacted to it, I wouldn\u2019t have probably commented at all) and I guess I\u2019m just feeling a bit overwhelmed with emotions today, that\u2019s why I reacted in a very intense way (also hormones, I\u2019m 8 months pregnant and on bed rest- but that\u2019s no excuse).\nThe intention of my post however was never to mock you or bring you down, I guess I kept my tone pretty firm because I consider it a serious matter. However I do apologise if I made you feel guilty or uncomfortable misunderstanding your post.

However I do apologise if I made you feel guilty or uncomfortable misunderstanding your post.

I have to admit I didn\u2019t see the shitpost tag (that would\u2019ve changed the way I reacted to it, I wouldn\u2019t have probably commented at all) and I guess I\u2019m just feeling a bit overwhelmed with emotions today, that\u2019s why I reacted in a very intense way (also hormones, I\u2019m 8 months pregnant and on bed rest- but that\u2019s no excuse).\nThe intention of my post however was never to mock you or bring you down, I guess I kept my tone pretty firm because I consider it a serious matter. However I do apologise if I made you feel guilty or uncomfortable misunderstanding your post. As I wrote in the last lines, you and every one of us is worth way more than that and hopefully we\u2019ll all soon realise it :)",

I have to admit I didn\u2019t see the shitpost tag (that would\u2019ve changed the way I reacted to it, I wouldn\u2019t have probably commented at all) and I guess I\u2019m just feeling a bit overwhelmed with emotions today, that\u2019s why I reacted in a very intense way (also hormones, I\u2019m 8 months pregnant and on bed rest- but that\u2019s no excuse).\nThe intention of my post however was never to mock you or bring you down, I guess I kept my tone pretty firm because I consider it a serious matter. However I do apologise if I made you feel guilty or uncomfortable misunderstanding your post.

However I do apologise if I made you feel guilty or uncomfortable misunderstanding your post. As I wrote in the last lines, you and every one of us is worth way more than that and hopefully we\u2019ll all soon realise it :)",
