I was the one people would jokingly ask out or who was used to tease their friend. \n\" I think DoggyDish likes you !\"\n\"EW! Anyone but them!!\"\n\nI honestly cannot go back to being fat. I'm treated so much better now. In school I was treated like garbage and to society I was invisible. It didn't matter how smart I was or what I could do. Now that I'm prettier people see me and hear me.  My opinions are respected more. I get job opportunities. People seek me out. I cannot go back to the nothingness of being unattractive.",

Copied what everyone else did as a teen (also developed an ED then unsurprisingly) & at some point I realised I was asked out by guys a lot more frequently than my peers (I convinced myself guys could tell I had low self-esteem & maybe thought I was \u2018easy\u2019, rather than believing I looked pretty to anyone). I was still bullied by horrible girls (that didn\u2019t end until college) & treated badly by guys (that never ends lol) but with 0 self-esteem I let it happen. I\u2019m 26 & just as insecure as I was 10 years ago even though I get compliments on my looks now & objectively know I look better (I\u2019m kind of repulsed by my younger self). Anyway... I relate to the idea of your past justifying your ED. It\u2019s like my perfectionism about myself/looks is fuelled by the fear of those past experiences.",

                "Text": "Yeah this definitely makes sense. I feel like when I was little little I was a cute kid then I just got awkward. I had this skin disorder that started in 2nd grade, they were like these tiny bumps on my face and hands?? No one really bothered me about them, then they got a little worse and 4th and 5th grade my \u201cfriends\u201d just constantly ragged on me for them. They would always say I had such bad acne, then just other things too. I grew up in a rich state, but never was as wealthy and didn\u2019t have as nice of things so that was always an issue too.\n\nMiddle school started, I pretty much dropped those \u201cfriends\u201d who killed on me, started hanging w weirder people, got ACTUAL acne, and became more of a social recluse and awkward. I was never bullied in the traditional sense but was always the weak one in a friend group. ED developed around 12/13, I did it to \u201ckeep me thin\u201d (was always low low avg) I blew up sophomore year from mainly binging and not being able to purge, worse acne lol. Got bullied and made fun of by lots of guys actually.\n\nJunior year my ED \u201ctruly developed\u201d IMO, lost a ton of weight, rode more horses, skin cleared up etc etc. I would say my \u201cglow up\u201d happened late teens early 20\u2019s. I am consistently told how pretty I am and how skinny I am- I\u2019m not just saying this to float my own boat. But I never believe it, and I think it\u2019s because of what I came from. I do think everyone goes through an awkward teenage phase, some worse than others. But my mind just goes, oh my ED made me look and feel better therefore without it I will be ignored and or killed on again. Need to maintain an \u201cideal and slim\u201d figure also while maintaining my overall appearance. Anyway I\u2019m 26 now and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever recover. Sorry for that ramble but I think a lot of what you said makes sense :-)",

                    "Text": " Not a ramble at all :) I love reading the longer heartfelt comments and posts. I relate to you so hard about being a cute kid and things going south. I went through a phase of hanging out with \u201cweird kids\u201d who I had nothing in common with because I didn\u2019t feel like anyone else would give me a chance.  I had a shit high school experience for the same reasons too, not necessarily bullied but self-isolated and always the underdog in a group. I felt like I was the odd one out, the least liked, because I was super quiet and low energy and couldn\u2019t keep up with people. \n \nAbout recovery: Imho, ED might as well be a hard drug. Whenever I read about the struggle of sobriety after experiencing that initial peak high, I think about the first time I put 2 and 2 together and realized people were treating me like a human because I was skinny. You can never unsee it, and it forever changes the way you see yourself and the world. You\u2019ll always be painfully aware that life could be that much easier. \n\nThank you for sharing!",

                    "Text": "Hey friend, \n\nI understand where you\u2019re coming from. When you\u2019re neck deep in an ED and unable to achieve your goal weight (which many people will never be able to do without causing serious damage, or worse) it can feel like you\u2019re failing at everything - because a lot of the time, it can feel like being thin IS everything: the gateway to happiness, intimacy, success, love. \n\nWe aren\u2019t all delusional: looks DO make a difference. It shouldn\u2019t be like that, but it is. It\u2019s undeniable - as proved by so many personal stories and experiences in the comment section - but so is the fact that nobody who will ever really love you will only love you for your body weight or bone structure. Beauty is a social fast pass valid only for the young and uncommitted, the value of your humanity is unconditional and permanent. \n\nEven at my lowest the thing that kept me from feeling like a useless, helpless, unlovable blob was knowing that one day it won\u2019t matter. I\u2019m going to get old, my metabolism is going to shut down, my skin is going to sag, and I\u2019ll probably end up with permanent fat deposits from childbearing, age or one of the many chronic conditions that come with late adulthood. So it everyone else. It\u2019s terrifying to think about. It makes me sick thinking about sometimes. \n\nBut then I remember my mom struggling to lose weight as a woman in her early fifties and how I loved her just as much 10 lbs heavier. I remember my sixty y/o therapist who is neither the thinnest nor the daintiest of women but who is a paramedic firefighter, little league coach, beloved wife, sister and mother, and how I catch myself thinking all the time: \u201cI wish I could be like her.\u201d I remember my uncle who struggles to avoid obesity due to an addiction to diet soda, and how no matter how many liters he brings to family trips I still find myself seeking out his incredible sense of humor and unconditional warmth. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you have a bad relationship with your family, if you can\u2019t recognize the non-aesthetic good qualities about yourself yet, or if you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to have people in your life that you truly love and who love you back, the point is this: \n\nLooks may make a huge difference when it comes to superficial affection from strangers, first impressions and opportunities, but every day that passes and every new experience you have brings your inherent worth as a human being closer to the surface. If everyone truly was worth only the measure of their attractiveness then even the prettiest college student might as well toss their life away at the first sign of wrinkles, because their only means of worth will inevitably expire. What\u2019s better: men holding doors open for you, inclusion and attention from strangers, or family tending to your every need as an old man/woman and the immeasurable love between friends who grow old together? Better yet, when it boils down to just beauty and humanity, which one truly carries more worth in the grand scheme of things? \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through such a hard time, but please know that no matter how often your ED mind and the world tells you that you aren\u2019t \u201cpretty\u201d or \u201cthin\u201d  enough the intrinsic value that every human being has will end up being your most precious trait. Physical attractiveness is just a temporary societal perk built upon the foundation of everything that makes you who you are; everything that makes your life irreplaceable. \nStick in there buddy!",

So, I first developed a problem with binging when I was like 8 years old which obviously lead me to gaining a ton of weight. \n\nThen, once I was going into middle school, I wanted to be skinny again, so I started purging. \n\nThen I started restricting on top of purging. \n\nAnd now I am so scared of being the fat kid again that I can\u2019t ever see myself not obsessing over food. Plus, I think being chubby as a kid made me 100x more critical of my body than I would\u2019ve been if I never gained weight in the first place. \n\nIf I only I could go back and tell my younger self that it doesn\u2019t matter how fat or \u201cugly\u201d you make yourself; people who prey on children aren\u2019t looking for beautiful children, they\u2019re looking for vulnerable ones.",

                "Text": "I\u2019m late to this post but, I can relate so much to this. It\u2019s both incredibly depressing and motivating (but like you said, not in a good way). It\u2019s definitely damaged how I view the world.\n\nWhen I was 13-16 and went from being a chubby preteen to being thin (and on/off struggling with an ED), the world suddenly became a completely different place. Including a flood of new male attention, from my peers but even more often from adult men. But hell even girls treated me very differently. Even my existing friends and family treated me very differently.\n\nIt\u2019s like I learned that the thinner and thinner I get, the more worth, acknowledgment, and love I\u2019ll finally attain from everyone. \n\nI gained it all back and then some when I was 17 (mostly due to some not great life stuff happening). Then when I was 20/21, I lost a massive amount of weight and it was like I suddenly existed again. \n\nI feel like growing up \u2018ugly\u2019 and \u2018growing out of it\u2019, not only leaves you somewhat jaded towards people, but makes you generally much more vulnerable and insecure.",

                "Text": "Crazy how so many of us can relate to this story. I was straight up the \u201cweird kid at school\u201d for most of my schooling experience. Cystic acne started in grade 5. Self harming started in grade 7. Was also always slightly chubbier than most girls until grade 11 which is when my ED gained full control. \n\nI had always felt like I had something wrong with me, and I think my ED gave me a way to mobilize that feeling - cos now I have a full time voice in my head constantly reminding me that I\u2019m not enough as well. \n\nIt changed my life around - I went from awkward and chubby to slim and elegant. People complimented me on my jaw line. Boys wanted to date me. Although only a few, I still had a really weird personality. I still do have a weird personality and I think to an extent that\u2019s kinda what saved me from being that \u201cpretty skinny popular girl\u201d, which I\u2019m glad I never became, because that would\u2019ve entailed me burying my entire personality and losing myself completely to my internal critic. \n\nIt\u2019s weird how other people see me so differently to how I see myself. A girl called me \u201ctiny\u201d 2 weeks ago, and I thought she was the tiny one. I thought I was the same size as my roommate (who is a very lovely and normal size) but then I tried on her pants and all of them were too big. Sometimes I look at my face in the bathroom mirror at uni and it\u2019s not the face I have in my mind. When I think of myself, I still think of a slightly chubby, spotty, awkward teen. Weird how the ED voice is so strong in my head that I can\u2019t even recognize myself.",

I'm at the lower end of healthy weight, my face gets thinner by the year (I'm 20 and lots of women experience facial changes in early 20s), I've got amazingly clear skin, super long naturally straight hair, and I've got a really good fashion sense.

While before i tried to make myself invisible in groups of strangers, now I assume people will accept me automatically (even if internally im still waiting for the rejection - self esteem doesn't fix itself even with weight loss).  I turned to restriction when I looked around and saw how the skinny pretty people were being treated and how free and comfortable they seemed in every situation. When I hit a low enough bmi I started acting like that was how I too would be treated, but I feel like my attitude and expectations changed and then it was just confirmation bias when I received different reactions from people or in situations. \n\nI don't know if that makes any sense but I'm trying to break the whole \"people only like you because you're skinny\" mentality in my head.",

If you\u2019re feeling miserable and withdrawing people aren\u2019t likely to seek you out, which, ontop of all the usual paranoia of being \u201ctoo big/ugly\u201d and unliked, really reinforces the belief that nobody wants to be around us when we\u2019re \u201cfat\u201d.  \n\nMaybe that\u2019s true, maybe it\u2019s not, but for sure nobody wants to be around misery. I\u2019m sure that some of the differences in the way people treat me when I\u2019m thinner vs heavier has to do with how I treat myself.",

I was always a chubby kid, and I continued to gain weight as I got older, despite being very athletic. The bullying and ridicule only got worse in middle and high school, and by the time I entered college I was regularly having panic attacks in public places. I've also struggled with disordered eating in some form since elementary school, but the restricting didn't get severe until I went away for school. I lost over half of my body weight (XXX lbs) in a couple of years because I basically stopped eating entirely and purged anything I did eat. \n\nWhen I was very ill (and thin for the first time in my life), people finally treated me like a human being. I noticed little changes to people's behavior--men holding doors open, store clerks asking me if I needed anything, people taking the seats next to me in crowded rooms--demonstrating that people didn't respect me unless I was thin. To this day, it's really painful when people compliment me on my appearance. If a friend points out that someone is flirting with me or hitting on me, I always get paranoid that they're all mocking me. My ED absolutely latches onto these painful memories because, in my mind, they're reality-based forms of evidence that I AM worthless without my illness. It's a way that my ED keeps me small and afraid.",

I've never had anyone treat me better or more nicely since, nor has anyone complimented me. When I originally was pretty, I was still treated like shit.\n\nI don't know if it's the culture of Europe vs. US, but that's why I like being online so much. In my hometown or even country, my neighbouring country where I am to study.. I'm kinda average height, weight and build. There isn't as much of a mold you need to shove yourself into, because the majority is born into the mold. On here all of a sudden, I'm tall. The distribution of body types is so different, it's more diverse, and I feel a bit more unique in my own skin.\n\nSometimes I just wish my girl friends commented on something. My boyfriend obviously notices and I don't need validation, but it's made me feel like my illness is normal and like I'm never pretty enough for it to outshine the parts of my personality I feel like everyone hates.\n\nI know it's probably a good thing, that my looks don't outshine my personality at all, it gives me the ability to make genuine friends and be myself, which is ultimately the most important to me. But sometimes, I wish myself was a little bit.. different. I wish my looks reflected my personality. I often don't feel like inside and outside are the same thing in me.",
