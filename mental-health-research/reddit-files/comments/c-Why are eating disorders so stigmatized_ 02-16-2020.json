If you are struggling with an eating disorder that is obviously causing thoughts that are disordered, instead of caring for you, the instant reply is, \"what about ME?\". No, my disorder is not about you, and I don't give a fuck if you want to be 600 pounds- do what makes you happy. It would be like if someone said, \"I feel like I am coming down with the flu\", and I replied, \"I know you feel sick, but how do you think I feel\". Generally, that teply would be considered narcissistic and rude.

Generally people are understanding though and it doesn\u2019t change you as a person.\n\nHowever - eating disorders are for some reason seen as very very taboo. There\u2019s often a weird hush when I let people know, they get very uncomfortable (even though I\u2019m usually very comfortable sharing when I do). They treat it like you\u2019ve been hiding this big secret from them, and now do not trust you to be able to handle yourself or ask for help with it if you needed it. \n\nLike, other mental disorders are just something you have to deal with - hell, you\u2019re even stronger for dealing with it. But eating disorders now mean you\u2019re a ticking time bomb of a person who will go off the rails any minute, and that is the most important thing about you.

We just have brains that are out to get us, and awful people who we have to deal with on the regular who make us think we are bad people just because we can't control our thoughts about *ourselves*.  \n\n\nA few years ago, during my last *really* bad bout with my ED (my ED was definitely winning at the time. She's a bitch, honestly), I tried to explain it to a friend who didn't understand, but \"wanted to\" in order to be a \"good friend\" and an ally who was \"in my corner.\" I said something to the effect of \"my ED makes me think that, ironically, the bigger I get, the more invisible I become. My opinions, my thoughts, my life, all mean less. Like the more room my body takes up, the less room my brain gets to have.\" She flipped, because she was overweight at the time, \"So you think I don't matter? My ideas, my life, doesn't matter?!\" She never talked to me again after that conversation, and wouldn't let me explain that this thought process only applied to ME. Because that's how f\\*cking EDs work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere will always be people in your life who will make YOUR mental illness about THEM. They were *never* your ally. **Ever**. No one who thinks like that was ever in your corner. But you'll find new allies, and they WILL be in your corner. They will love you, warts and all, and they'll fight the fight with you if you let them. Even when it gets bad, and even when you cry all day, and would rather die than eat a blueberry muffin (it's been a weird day for me, just go with it).   \n\n\nI just don't want you to ever think that there will be no one in your real life who will get you. It may take a while to find them, but it only takes ONE person in your real life who *gets* you to make the difference. To not push you into recovery, to not yell at you when you only order your safe food at a restaurant, to not judge you for drinking like 9 Monster Ultras when you have a group hangout with your friends. Never stop looking for your ally. It's an invaluable resource, and genuinely aids you - even if it's just an ear - with this shit ass disorder.",

                "Text": "I totally get the spirit of this post and it needed to be posted, but at the same time the number of times, even on here, that I've seen someone harshly judge someone else for being fat/big/heavy/overweight/obese/whatever kind of complicates it for me. \n\nThe fact is that fat people, and other people who don't fit \"The Norm\" are at best, underrepresented and at worst, outright hated. So much so that it's internalized by the very groups who are tortured by it. I mean, just take a look at /fatl*gic, where most of the people who post those awful things are fat and trying to lose weight. That's how they think of themselves, too. \n\nEven for those of us who aren't fat, it can be really hard sometimes to notice when our behavior and our words could hurt someone else who is, especially if we've never been fat and don't know what it's like and what even could be hurtful. I'd been a few pounds overweight for much of my childhood/adolescence and even then I could feel the judgement and often outright bullying, but a lot of that was also subconscious, seemingly harmless comments on other people's own bodies. I have no idea what it's like to be big, and I can't speak to that, but even at a high-healthy/just-over weight I was hyper conscious of other people's bodies and eating behaviors, and what they might think of mine. Which is why comments on your body, while totally about you, may make someone else reflect badly on theirs. Hell, I learned to hate my body as a child from my mom, who openly hated hers. Now I try my very hardest to not make ANY comments on myself, other people, or food if someone else is there, because you never know how someone listening might take it. I never want my problems to make someone else feel bad about themselves.\n\n\nNot to hijack your post, just offering another perspective as a person who's toed the line between healthy and fat.\n\n\nEdited because the body comments thing wasn't the whole point of your post and I really wanted to address the other parts too:\n\nIt's really interesting that there's so much stigma about ED's, but also that it varies depending on which one you're talking about. Anorexia is desirable, saintly. Bulimia is gross, out of control, but at least you're punishing yourself for it. BED is just worse. Orthorexia is healthy and fit, not even a real problem. EDNOS? Huh? ARFID, picky eaters. And the \"advice\" for how to \"cure\" them is all the same: just eat healthy most of the time and exercise!\n\nAnd then, like, how do those recovery warriors even do it? I feel like I've lost all sense of balance in just the last year, how do you regain and then maintain that for the rest of your life? While also putting yourself so far out there and making yourself so vulnerable? How do you \"love yourself\" and actually believe it?\n\nIdk if any of this rambling made sense at all. I hope you ended up getting some sleep! Thanks for posting.",

                "Text": "I hope it\u2019s okay if I offer my perspective, as someone who doesn\u2019t have an ED. I didn\u2019t really understand EDs much until I was in a long term mental health treatment facility and I met people with EDs and developed friendships with them, and saw how much they were suffering. They weren\u2019t all skinny people, as I\u2019d previously assumed, and they challenged my previously-held negative beliefs about people with EDs. If you wonder what I\u2019m doing on this sub, it\u2019s mostly to understand people with EDs better, and to understand my own, increasingly-disordered relationship with food (fasting, fad diets, etc).\n\nAll my life, I was never skinny, but never really \u201cfat\u201d either. For most of my adult life I maintained at about 135 lbs, which I was happy with. About five years ago I was prescribed antipsychotics to treat severe mental health issues. I can\u2019t really describe the hunger those meds cause - it\u2019s like you\u2019re burning with hunger 24/7, you could eat an entire buffet and you\u2019d still be burning with hunger. So my weight ended up ballooning. After a while I got my hunger under control, but at that point I\u2019d become a fully-fledged alcoholic. I\u2019d go days and days without eating because I was drinking a liquid diet, and I was still gaining weight. At my heaviest, I\u2019d gained 100 lbs.\n\nI started to experience life as a fat person for the first time. And I actually became jealous of people with EDs, as bad as that sounds. I\u2019d ask myself, \u201cOf all the mental illnesses I\u2019ve been cursed with, WHY couldn\u2019t I be cursed with one that makes me skinny?\u201d I realize, looking back on it, that it was a really shitty and selfish way of thinking. It didn\u2019t help that a lot of my friends got into this podcast with two anorexic hosts, and one of the hosts in particular is always bragging about how skinny she is and how it makes her better than all of us gross fat people. The more I think about it, the bragging is probably a coping mechanism, and I shouldn\u2019t judge her for it. But it increased the burning jealousy. \n\nThe short and simple answer is, a lot of the stigma surrounding EDs come from people who are bitter about their weight and have a poor self-image. I\u2019m definitely guilty of it, which is why I know what it comes from. I hate being fat so much. I hate it with every fiber of my being, and even now I still feel so jealous of skinny people. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that we\u2019re like that. I\u2019m sorry that we\u2019re so bitter. I\u2019m sorry that we tend to make other people\u2019s struggle with EDs all about ourselves. It\u2019s not right and it\u2019s something I\u2019m still struggling with. You all deserve so much better.",
