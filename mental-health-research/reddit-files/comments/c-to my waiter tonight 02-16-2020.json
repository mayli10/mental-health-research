Only one to order a water. Then he looked through the menu for a long time. Asked me some questions that I know I\u2019d be asking in that situation. Then decided to get nothing. His mom tried to coax him or suggest something small but he wasn\u2019t interested, she even n mmh entiende he hadn\u2019t had breakfast. It made me so sad to see someone so young and honestly saw myself a little in him, being a guy as well. I wanted to suggest a low calorie option or something but I also didn\u2019t want to be rude or out him, especially if I was wrong and he just wasn\u2019t hungry.
