I was telling a friend the other day, my eating disorder was my way of screaming when I was a kid. A lot of really fucked up shit was going on that I had no control over. I couldn't yell, I couldn't leave, I couldn't get help, where other people would slam and break things, I couldn't. I wanted to hurt things. I was angry and frustrated. I couldn't get away with anything. But I *could* get away with self harm etc. That's why I always think it's funny how many people will say that eds are for attention bc like yeah man I got away with it for like ... 6 some odd years? Don't you think I would have given up by that point if it was just about attention? It's coping. It's your safety blanket. It's your way of retaliating when there's no other options. And it's fucked up, but it is what it is. I think we can all relate to that a bit.",

In the middle of the conversation a spider crawled onto the table and instead of saving it and taking it outside like he \"usually\" does (probably just for show), he raised his hand into a fist and he slammed it down onto the spider and I just fucking lost it. Haven't eaten all day because FUCK HIM for doing that. So fucking messed up. I mean, I've killed bugs before, I don't necessarily freak out like that every time, but it was the way he did it, the whole context. Like he was trying to show us that he was god or something. Fuck, sorry for taking over your post, this just really upset me today.",
