Anxiety prevents you of giving yourself time, it forces you into feeling guilty which aggravates the ED.",

The looking at fat ladies part helped because I didn't saw obese women, or just fat like me, as ugly. I realized that I hated my body no matter what weight I was, that the same fat didn't seem to bother me if it was on other people, I even find it sexy!!\n\nThere's never specific steps you can take towards thar click moment, in the end, sometimes it's triggered by the stupidest things. For me a wake up call was seeing a twitter account that was from a girl with dysmorphia. She was so thin and pretty, got complimented all day long, yet she felt the need of bashing herself every day, calling herself fat and using fat as a shaming word.\n\nI found it utterly unhealthy and it seemed like she was struggling a lot. I then realized, I am just like that, minus the twitter account. I felt so embarassed for being like that, I didn't dare fat shame myself again haha",

I was close once, but things happened in my life (ex was obsessed with other girl) and the compulsive comparing myself with other women and self sabotage began again.\n\nA year has passed and in that process I just went back to binging, which is, essentially sabotage. I gained 10kg back without even realizing it, it was wrecking my mental health and ruining sexual relationships for me. I can't stand being naked in front of sexual partners without great shame.\n\nBut it's a journey, if I was doing well I wouldn't be in this sub, anyways.\nI'm trying to get these feelings out, which is a lot easier on reddit with strangers, than pouring my heart out to my loved ones (again).\n\nI think I will take erotica pictures this time, instead of just nudes. Nude pictures helped me see myself as a person, to give my body visibility, I just gazed at them and realized my body was normal, not deformed. The erotica part will help me sexualize myself again, when I feel bad about my body, I feel unatractive, and it cripples my confidence with everything else in my life. I hope seeing myself as a desirable sex object will improve my self esteem.\n\nAlso started going to therapy and this alone skyrocketted my well being.",
