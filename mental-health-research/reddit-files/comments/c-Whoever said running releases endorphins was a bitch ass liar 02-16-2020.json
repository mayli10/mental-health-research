I'm currently out of shape and fucking hate moving, but I can give my personal word that it does exist. \n\nAfter like 3 weeks of running 4 times/week I got the floaty nice runner's high thingy. Also had to cut my alcohol consumption to get it.\n\nAnyway, I think it's probably real, but it's no easy thing to master. \n\nCurrent mood is fuck exercise tho and I'm drinking while sitting on my couch so typing this is painful in itself lol",
