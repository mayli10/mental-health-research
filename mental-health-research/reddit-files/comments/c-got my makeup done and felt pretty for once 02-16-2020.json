I have my trial hair and makeup in a few weeks and I hope it goes as well as yours. I'm glad you felt beautiful, we all deserve to- especially on our wedding day (though every other day too!)",

I'm sure you'll look amazing <3   \nWeddings can be so stressful, and I know I was feeling really insecure about my weight when I got married, but once I was in the middle of everything I was so focused on the excitement of being married to a man that I loved, sharing our new life together, and the reception was a blast! I didn't think once about how I looked because I felt so in the moment-- I did my own makeup and you're so right about it effecting how you feel!   \n\n\nBest wishes for your marriage and I hope your day is everything you want it to be!",
