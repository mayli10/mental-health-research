You should know that you deserve it, because no one deserves something as horrible as an ed.\n\n\nIf you choose to eat the burger king you would end up with a calorie count just below what a \u201dnormal/average\u201d person needs. So no need to freak out after this meal. This day is a great step towards recovery or even just harm reduction. Know that this day doesn\u2019t have to mean that you need to go in to recovery, eat x amount of calories per day, or gain lots of weight. It\u2019s just a good opportunity for you to start recovery if you want to, and if you don\u2019t, you could just see this as a \u201dharm reduction\u201d or \u201dself care\u201d day.
