Your card has 10 or 12 swipes depending on your plan. You can only eat 10 or 12 times a week and it sounds very little but it's because our cafeteria is a buffet style. You only really need to eat once a day.\n\nEtc\n\nI also constantly drink zero cal drinks but nobody knows it's zero calories so I look more like I am a junk food eater. Zero cal coke, zero cal diet coke, zero cal monster, zero cal fruit juice.\n\nI eat tons of 5 or 10 cal cal candies in front of people so they don't catch on. \n\nI also have abdominal migraines so sometimes I pretend I have an attack so I don't have to eat for a couple days.",
