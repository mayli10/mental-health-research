Or what's the point, I've lost most of my back teeth from years of purging, and I can't even fit into my old clothes because years of \"recovery\" left me 30 pounds higher than my lw. I really wonder why I even bothered... I told myself I would regret it. That I would never be one of \"those\" people. Now, here I am. Left trying to pick up the pieces, my health is shit and I'm only 23, I'm depressed, have anxiety and ptsd (which of course led to the ed) but now I have no coping!! Except for eating... /: so I've just gotten bigger and bigger and bigger with nothing to really \"keep me in check\" because it seems that recovering to me is not doing restriction or exercise but eating an entire tub of ice cream and sitting in bed all day is perfectly acceptable.  :))) i hate myself lol",
