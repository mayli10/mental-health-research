I guess I'm hoping that eventually I'll get under a low enough weight that I'll be happy, and then I won't be so sick that I can't just eat semi-nornally, and I'll maintain under that low weight forever lmao\n\n...now that I read that back, it just sounds like normal dieting.

Maybe my \u201cnormal\u201d eating was a little on the health nut/macros side of things, but I would still be able to have noodles or sweets in moderation. I was able to maintain within 5-10 lbs of my low weight. The combination of birth control and mood stabilizers made \u201cnormal\u201d eating more like binging, and over the past few years I gained over 50 pounds, losing then gaining back the same 20 lbs while going through phases of eating whatever and restricting or orthorexia. \n\nBeing that way doesn\u2019t invalidate you or your disorder. \n\nI have bipolar disorder, which for me means that I have pretty long stretches of being pretty stable/asymptomatic. But then the Depression would creep on, usually be followed by mania, then a mixed state, and then I would level out for however long. Now that I\u2019m older I have more symptoms outside my mood cycles (memory issues, insomnia, some cognitive processing difficulties, impulsivity), but overall I seem normal to most people who haven\u2019t seen me during an episode. \n\nEDs are the same. It\u2019s not a constant struggle between restricting and binging for many people. You can eat normally, maybe with a few quirks (like I still like to eat with tiny plates/silverware and have some forever fear foods like fast food and non diet soda), but you aren\u2019t actively having an ED. You may bounce between normal eating and restricting, normal eating and binging, or a combination of all three.",

When I go out to eat with others or I visit family, I try to eat normally though because I don\u2019t want anyone to notice my my eating habits. I don\u2019t want people to worry about me but I fully intend on restricting again as soon as they aren\u2019t around. Sometimes I overeat a little bit when I am around others, but it\u2019s never really a binge because it\u2019s not out of control and I planned it. I have actually binged twice in my life and I felt so horrible afterwards that I could never do it again. It\u2019s part of why I don\u2019t do low restricting; I\u2019m afraid I will want to binge again because I know it will increase hunger much more. \n\nI think it\u2019s probably more common to be like this than than to have a more severe disorder. I think disordered eating probably falls on a spectrum of severity and it\u2019s more common to be sort of borderline in behavior. So you may not end up with the horrible physical effects you would get from very severely disordered habits but you can still have a lot of psychological turmoil. Since you don\u2019t really have the severe physical effects it makes it easier to rationalize your behavior and you can pretend that what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t unhealthy. But you probably will be malnourished over time and you probably will end up being more susceptible to getting sick and whatnot. I think probably a lot of successful models and actresses are borderline disordered.",
