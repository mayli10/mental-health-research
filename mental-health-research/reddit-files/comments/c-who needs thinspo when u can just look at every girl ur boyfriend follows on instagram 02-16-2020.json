I know I\u2019m overreacting because I like pictures of other guys and girls and it\u2019s no problem. This girl is someone that went to our high school. Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times. But my bf now isn\u2019t bad. I think it\u2019s kind of toxic if anyone to ask their boyfriend to unfollow all the girls they follow and stop liking other girls pictures because they\u2019re insecure.",

I know I\u2019m overreacting because I like pictures of other guys and girls and it\u2019s no problem. This girl is someone that went to our high school. Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times. But my bf now isn\u2019t bad. I think it\u2019s kind of toxic if anyone to ask their boyfriend to unfollow all the girls they follow and stop liking other girls pictures because they\u2019re insecure.",

Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times. But my bf now isn\u2019t bad. I think it\u2019s kind of toxic if anyone to ask their boyfriend to unfollow all the girls they follow and stop liking other girls pictures because they\u2019re insecure.",

And it sucks how so many people can relate to the stress. :(\n\nIs your boyfriend the single most societally-accepted-form-of-hot man in the world? Doubt it. But you still like/love him, yeah?\n\nDo you like him any less when you follow a more-muscular guy, or friend them, or see them walking by and think \"ooh damn\" for 2 seconds?\n\nSwitching roles up to figure out relationship crap helps me ground myself sometimes. No clue if it'd help you too, but here goes hope.\n\nSure, he could unfollow the women. But that could just end with you feeling like you have to compare yourself to the next group he's around. There's always going to be thinner women somewhere in the world, and hell...with the way disordered brains can be, for all any of us know, you might actually weigh less than they do. You should be able to trust that you're his one and only, and he wants to be with *you*, specifically - no matter who else he works with, or looks at, or jokes around with.\n\nGo ask him what he likes about you. Whether he likes the girls he follows more. Ask him how he feels about them, why he follows them, whatever. Wouldn't be surprised if the answers are a lot less you vs them than your brain wants you to have to worry about in silence. Distant hot people should be in the same bin as food porn - fun to look at when bored, but forgotten an hour later.\n\nAnd if the answers aren't reassuring, and this is a glaring issue that's everything you were worried about...at least you can talk it out or do something to end the situation? One way or another.",

Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times.

I think it\u2019s really unhealthy for you to ask your partner to unfollow girls and stop liking their pictures.

I think it would be inappropriate to link her account but seriously she's always wearing it. aaaand she's posted pics of her arm outstretched so it looks all bony and you can see the red bracelet dangling off her wrist.... Like there's just no way that's a coincidence lol\n\nedit: I'm sorry guys, I'm not going to tell you in a PM either \ud83d\ude2d I know that's annoying but I've been thinking it over for like 10 minutes and I just don't feel comfortable.

I know I\u2019m overreacting because I like pictures of other guys and girls and it\u2019s no problem. This girl is someone that went to our high school. Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times. But my bf now isn\u2019t bad. I think it\u2019s kind of toxic if anyone to ask their boyfriend to unfollow all the girls they follow and stop liking other girls pictures because they\u2019re insecure.",

I think it would be inappropriate to link her account but seriously she's always wearing it. aaaand she's posted pics of her arm outstretched so it looks all bony and you can see the red bracelet dangling off her wrist.... Like there's just no way that's a coincidence lol\n\nedit: I'm sorry guys, I'm not going to tell you in a PM either \ud83d\ude2d I know that's annoying but I've been thinking it over for like 10 minutes and I just don't feel comfortable.

I know I\u2019m overreacting because I like pictures of other guys and girls and it\u2019s no problem. This girl is someone that went to our high school. Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times. But my bf now isn\u2019t bad. I think it\u2019s kind of toxic if anyone to ask their boyfriend to unfollow all the girls they follow and stop liking other girls pictures because they\u2019re insecure.",

Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times.

Now my ex who would only follow girls, basically refused to follow guys and flirted with these girls is trash and was addicted to porn because he jerked off like 6 times a day and cheated on countless times.
