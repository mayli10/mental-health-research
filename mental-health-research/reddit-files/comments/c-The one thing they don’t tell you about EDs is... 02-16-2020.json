Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again.

Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again. It's also a lot less painful than stimulant lax, and you'll be a lot less likely to shit yourself!",

Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again.

                            "Text": "I\u2019m not sure why your comment got downvoted, using laxatives isn\u2019t bad at all if you use them very sparingly every once in a while if you\u2019re super backed up which most of us that have a super restrictive diet are. Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again. It's also a lot less painful than stimulant lax, and you'll be a lot less likely to shit yourself!",

Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again. It's also a lot less painful than stimulant lax, and you'll be a lot less likely to shit yourself!",

Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again.

Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again. It's also a lot less painful than stimulant lax, and you'll be a lot less likely to shit yourself!",

Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again. It's also a lot less painful than stimulant lax, and you'll be a lot less likely to shit yourself!",

Not producing a BM for too long can cause severe health risks and can even be fatal. Our colon absorbs all the water from bowels the longer they sit in us and the bowels become rock hard and dry making it difficult to pass and just stays and builds up. When it doesn\u2019t come out it can cause colorectal cancer and other issues. Just have to be careful not to use them as a weight loss method cause thats when people become addicted. It\u2019s only going to get rid of water and fecal matter, nothing else. I use this generic pink box you can get at any drugstore it says women\u2019s laxative stimulant and they\u2019re little pink ones. Don\u2019t take more than 1-2 at a time and don\u2019t take them but once every few months only for severe constipation. Not good for your organs to take them frequently. Best to avoid them as much as you can.",

You can't overdose on it and hurt yourself as it doesn't affect you electrolyte balance, but it's still very effective. It works by pulling water back into the colon to help get things moving again. It's also a lot less painful than stimulant lax, and you'll be a lot less likely to shit yourself!",

But then you do, and you keep eating more because you can't stop yourself, so you might as well give in and say 'fuck it' anyway. the cycle continues. it fucking sucks and you feel like you can't tell anyone because it's so embarrassing even tho you know you're psychologically fucked up and need help, and you're also killing your metabolism :/ been dealing with this a lot lately for whatever reason. I'm convinced that I've permanently ruined my stomach's ability to look flat because of years of binging, like it will never look 'normal' let alone flat, just soft and pudgy even though I've been low-normal weight/underweight the last two years. what if I need lipo or something to finally fix it? idk",
