I once drank a bottle of magnesium citrate (the label says it will cause a bowel movement in 30 min to a few hours). 12 hours later, still nothing but a lot of angry gurgling of my stomach. I once had to take one of those colonoscopy prep kits. It flushes your system to the point you are passing nothing but clear liquid. It took 6 DAYS for me to poo after that.
