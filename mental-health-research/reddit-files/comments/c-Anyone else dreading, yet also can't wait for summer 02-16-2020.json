I'm traveling to/with my SO this summer, and before that my city has our Pride march, my best friend/ex gf gets discharged after 2+ years, and I'm on track to hit my GW(*doubts in ED*) by then. \nOnly down side is a toxic relationship I had 5+ years ago always rekindles in summer and ends in sex, like clockwork, and it fucks with my head.
