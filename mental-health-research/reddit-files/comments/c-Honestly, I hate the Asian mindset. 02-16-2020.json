                "Text": "This is honestly why I hate the inevitable discourse of Asian mediums being white washed in America. Eventually there are people who fall back on aged historical premises that the value of having fair skin is a result of aristocracy without actually thinking about how beauty standards always evolve over time no matter the culture. You can't convince me that the push for anglo-saxon features in the Philippines or any Asian country for that matter, was a result of staying indoors. \n\nBeing skinny comes easier to some, and while Asian cultures promote this on a really unhealthy level, the added ideal of having white features makes ED and body dysphoria so much worse. These unrealistic expectations of beauty are a hybrid of Asian perfectionism and Western influence and eventually, even if you try to fit in, when you think about it where does your identity really come from? Arbitrary standards of \"perfect\" from your ethnic background on top of being subjugtated by foreign (western) ideals that have seeped into your culture that now feel as if they instrinsically belong there. My point being that the social and mental intricacies of being Asian are so hybrid it's hard to even find a mental health professional that understands the cultural problems surrounding this and I live in America. I could tell you about the countless professionals I've seen and discussed the abuse I've faced with my parents along with my ED/dysphoria only to have them brush it off as \"Well it's normal in your culture so why is it a problem with you?\" Word for word what I've been told at mental hospitals. We seriously need more POC mental health professionals who understand problems that come with being POC. We need more recognition about how Asians relate to their own bodies across the world because there are so many socio-historical nuances to them that we tend to get lumped together and have our experiences brushed off.",

I grew up in singapore and my mother was so incredibly controlling over what i hate, how i ate, giving me tips on how to eat and stay thin. Since i was her golden mixed child and was very light skinned and looked very european she favored me but her favor was more in making me just the best of all my siblings. Wanting me to be a great athlete, student, and above all thin and pretty. Its so common to see other asians raised in any country having intense ed issues. \n\nSince coming to the us its been a mixed bag..the sizing is better here. People dont openly give disordered eating advice or shame you for your body. And the intense heavy need to be thin is there, its much more shifted to fitness and having good musculature than just being small. Which i like it helps me make better decisions rather than to just restrict. So i can get myself to just, eat , more. \n\nBut unfortunately asian women especially feel that talkinf about your weight is appropriate. Regardless of if they know yoy. It makes me so paranoid every time i have to go home i starve for a month to avoid the comments.",

This lead to my mother getting those whitening shots and going to the gym (no \"bad eating\" habits thank god) . She complains about how she looks which resulting in me thinking that's okay. I already have a low self esteem in the first place but this made me look at each part more.

Like make up your minds. It just goes to show you can\u2019t win no matter what you do. Like yes I agree to some extent eating disorders are like in your mind / your mentality as all mental illnesses are, however people are surprised I developed it and looking back at my life I\u2019m not. As fucked as this is it makes sense given my upbringing that I developed this. My weight was always the first thing people mentioned even now. I honestly don\u2019t think I would have developed this if people hadn\u2019t been so focused on my weight. Like yes you can control how much things effect you but at the end of the day it\u2019s those experiences that also shape who you become ",

This lead to my mother getting those whitening shots and going to the gym (no \"bad eating\" habits thank god) . She complains about how she looks which resulting in me thinking that's okay. I already have a low self esteem in the first place but this made me look at each part more. I thought I'm just fat which gradually evolved into \"my eyes are not the same size\" \"my lips are too big and dont have a cupid's bow\"\n\nIm not just fat anymore.. I'm a monster hahah",
