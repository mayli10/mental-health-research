I fast all day so I get the mental benefits of fasting/heavy restricting, then eat a ton for dinner to make up the calories (not binging, just getting in my allotment for the day). I guarantee no nutritionist would support this model of recovery, but I can maintain my weight without binging and still feel the mental benefits of heavy restricting, so it's a win for me.

I work a customer service job and am so introverted/depressed that I started drinking at work to keep everything up. I would take three shots of vodka throughout the day (breakfast, lunch, dinner time ish) on an empty stomach. Obviously I stopped, but my commission has gone down. Customers tell me to smile more. I know it wasn\u2019t healthy or okay but I wish I could feel like that without being destructive. I\u2019m also more productive if I don\u2019t eat and fast instead. There\u2019s so much less on my mind and I don\u2019t feel gross or want to clean something as a distraction instead of eating. This cycle is hell. Even now after quitting drinking I started buying addy. ",

I keep meaning to see the doctor because it feels like textbook hypoglycemia//I\u2019ve had blood sugar issues before.\n\nI forgot about this though! I used to love working out fasted. I\u2019ll have to give this a try thank you so much!  \n\nEdit: also, the most unconventional things have been my primary sources of improvement (birth control helped my mood and binging a good deal, methylated folate was amazing for my chronic pain/physical health, etc. - and I am a fan of intermittent fasting for the benefits so why not). So as much as doctors are pros in their field, it doesn\u2019t mean something helpful isn\u2019t helpful for you - especially if there isn\u2019t much evidence on the topic/it\u2019s new!",
