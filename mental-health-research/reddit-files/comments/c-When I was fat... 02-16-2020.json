I was bullied my whole life over my weight, by both family and friends. Then I was suddenly worthy of talking to and hanging out with. It was perplexing and I was secretly very resentful for a while about it. Eventually people started to get concerned, but since my weight changed so dramatically in a year and a half, I felt no matter what I weighed, it wouldn't satisfy anyone. I'm never satisfied either though. The way I was treated so differently fucked with my head and still impacts me 8 years later. I am always nervous to see my family, because even when I'm barely a healthy BMI, they ALWAYS have to make some comment about my weight. I wish people could just focus on themselves. 99.9% of the time someone comments about my weight, they're overweight.",

I'm sorry to hear of how cruelly people treated you.\n\nLike 90% of the reason why I worked so hard to lose my freshman 15 (more like 25 lol) in just under 3 months was because I noticed such a harsh contrast in how I was treated. People, especially men, are so much nicer to me when I'm at the lower end of a 'healthy' bmi/slightly underweight. It's pretty gross. Also, it goes both ways: the thicker girls\u2013\u2013the girls who used to be so, so cruel to me\u2013\u2013were suddenly dying to be my friend after I gained 30 lb. It was weird to watch them suddenly accept me as human, as one of them.\n\nI lost the weight because I got fed up with how my family treated me. We're Korean, so it's typical for anyone with a slightly overweight\u2013\u2013or even mid-healthy\u2013\u2013bmi to be treated as sub-human. (Obviously not all Koreans are like this, but culturally it's pretty acceptable to be overtly 'fatphobic'.) They said they don't know where their beautiful girl went, and don't you hate yourself for being so overweight?\n\n(I wasn't. My bmi was twenty fucking one.)\n\nI don't know why I went on a tangent about me; the post is about you, so that wasn't my intention. I guess my point is that I really empathize with your experiences and understand how people are so cruelly superficial. Sending you a virtual hug, bb",

Fat is much preferentially stored as fat. Carbs are first stored as glycogen then fat, but a lot is lost as heat (look up dietary thermogenesis). \nAlso can't fully  understand what you're saying cuz you're clearly not a native English speaker. \n\nRead the China Study people. Why are Asians so much leaner than Americans? Cuz they eat a starch based diet. Tell me how rice is more fattening than ice cream cuz it's more carb heavy?\n\nMight also want to look up calories per gram for protein, carbs and fat. Spoiler: fat has twice the calorie density. Carbs and protein are equal. Are you scared of protein too?",
