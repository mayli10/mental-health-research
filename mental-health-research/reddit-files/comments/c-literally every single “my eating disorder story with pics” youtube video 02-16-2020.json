There\u2019s so much obsessing that goes into it and it is a lifestyle thing that takes over every facet of your life. Why do we glamorize it so much? Literally I had a more forgiving diet when I had anorexia than when I went paleo and started working out. At least back then I was allowed to have Parmesan cheese. As someone in recovery who shifted from anorexic to \u201cI work out daily and only eat bird food\u201d I have to say...I see no difference other than people\u2019s acceptance of this lifestyle as opposed to my previous one. Still obsessing over food/diet/exercise. Still filled with self-loathing. Still body dysmorphic. Only difference is I have an ass now. Wtf.",
