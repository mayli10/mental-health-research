I didn\u2019t work out, but I did move around a lot without even being aware. Fidgeting, playing outside with my dogs, etc. it adds up :) \n\nPlus when you\u2019re really full, you tend to eat less without being aware of it. Eg; thanksgiving.

Like, if there's a picture of a skinny person from the front, I imagine that their thighs *might* look much fatter from the side and only thin from the front (I have that myself) but when I see a thin person IRL and I see that their legs are thin all around, it triggers me like crazy.\n\nLike, there are are actually people whose legs hardly spill out at all when they sit, or there's hardly any hanging mass when they lift up their legs. Timothee Chalamet has that for example. Like... How?! \ud83d\ude31",

I didn\u2019t work out, but I did move around a lot without even being aware. Fidgeting, playing outside with my dogs, etc. it adds up :) \n\nPlus when you\u2019re really full, you tend to eat less without being aware of it. Eg; thanksgiving. I ate only 1 meal and I was full all night til the next morning around 10am \n\n",

Eating disorders, BDD, and disordered eating are nearly ubiquitous here.\n\nAlso, this is why Asian men and women with EDs fly under the radar so often and are underdiagnosed. Even if we have a BMI of 16, people think we're \"just naturally like that\". This is compounded by the stigma against mental healthcare in many Asian cultures.",

I didn\u2019t work out, but I did move around a lot without even being aware. Fidgeting, playing outside with my dogs, etc. it adds up :) \n\nPlus when you\u2019re really full, you tend to eat less without being aware of it. Eg; thanksgiving. I ate only 1 meal and I was full all night til the next morning around 10am \n\n",
