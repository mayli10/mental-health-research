I was so thin and elegant looking. \n\nNow I look at myself in exactly the same way as I did when I had what turns out was a pretty nice body, looking back. I'm up 45 lbs from the birth control I was on for the past 5 years. Everyone still calls me \"skinny\"; I look in the mirror and see a fat piece of shit.

I actually photoshopped my body to be skinny back at my highest weight to fantasize about what it would be like (and how happy I'd be), but now I look even skinnier than those photoshopped pictures. Yet all I focus on is my stomach not being perfectly flat and still dislike my body.\n\nTo my past self it would sound insane and almost insulting that I now see nothing but missing hipbones and a waist not small enough in the pictures I saw as perfection back then.

She and my dad won't tell me what she weighs because they know it won't do any good (I used to ask obsessively when I was younger, and when I would get mad at her I would always somehow work in the fact that she is thinner than me yet I'm the one with the problem).
