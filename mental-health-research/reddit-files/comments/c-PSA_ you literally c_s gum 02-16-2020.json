                        "Text": "I have a semi-scientific hypothesis that c/s is essentially useless for foods that are sugar-based, and only half-effective for carb-based.  \n(depends on how long you chew for too obv, since if you chew anything for 0.01s before spitting then clearly you won't absorb much)\n\nBut yeah, I gathered this since we learned in high school bio that you have enzymes in your spit that start the breakdown of carbs into sugars. But there's no such enzyme for proteins & fats until they get to the stomach.   \nIt was a pretty neat & quick experiment actually that you can try rn.   \nYou just chew a Pringle for 2 minutes without swallowing, then test the amount of sugar in the chewed up chip vs how much it had initially. You can actually taste the chip turning sweet after chewing it for that long, since the carbs are being broken down into sugars.\n\nSo idk the exact percent of carbs that you might avoid using c/s, but I reckon that you can eliminate nearly 100% of the calories in something like a chicken wing or a steak, so long as you're prudent about not swallowing the oil.",
