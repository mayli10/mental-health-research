Get to work, coffee, ECA stack #2. Eat my 300 Calorie lunch I meal prepped on Sunday. ECA stack #3. Go home. Microwave and eat stir fry veggies and a can of soup.

It's entirely possible to just reply to them nicely while educating them as well, which would ultimately cease any further comments from them about your 'fast metabolism'. Reply to them nicely and with respect and you won't come off as a bitch; I doubt the people that make comments like that are intentionally trying to irritate you.",

They're just in denial that you have to put in the effort to expend more energy than you consume. People are happier under the guise that I'm ~~skinny~~ healthy because of lucky fast metabolism, and they're not because of unlucky slow metabolism.\n\nThe denial is so deep. I'm frequently reminded of the time I ate a calzone last month, while they refuse to acknowledge that I've eaten salad every day since.",
