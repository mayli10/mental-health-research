You are not alone and you aren\u2019t disgusting, it won\u2019t last forever I promise. The binge eating is your body\u2019s natural response to the starvation, hence why so many people who have had restrictive EDs go on to develop some form of BED. Again, it won\u2019t last forever though and you are not alone \ud83d\udc96",

I think obsessing over food so long & depriving myself for so long I just gave in, and now it\u2019s become just as much of a problem as the restricting was. I hope it won\u2019t last forever, no matter how much I try to make myself fall back into restricting again I always end up back here in a cycle of binge eating. It developed because I gained a lot of weight due to problems with alcohol (literally went from underweight to the higher end of being a \u201chealthy\u201d weight) & since then I\u2019ve kinda given up on everything really.",

I think most people tend to get stuck in cycles of binge eating and restricting before eventually re-learning how to eat a healthy amount and eventually develop a healthy relationship with food (ugh, goals).

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too. Hope u can break out of this cycle at some point\ud83d\udc96",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too. Hope u can break out of this cycle at some point\ud83d\udc96",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too. Hope u can break out of this cycle at some point\ud83d\udc96",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

For me the hardest part was the reaction from family, friends, coworkers, etc. When I was underweight I got the concerned comments, when I ballooned up past 200 pounds I got SILENCE, then when I began losing through healthy eating, I got compliments that triggered me into wanting to lose faster and go back to unhealthy restrictive behaviors. I am in a healthy weight range now but I feel disgusting. It also sucks having a closet ranging in sizes from xxs to xl and size 2 from size 18 pants. I just can't part with the smallest sized clothing because I keep thinking I can get back to those sizes in a healthy way. Good luck, I know exactly how hard this is.",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

After I graduated I gained an insane amount of weight because my diet habits went all over the place. I've been out of highschool for 4 years now. Most of the weight gain was in the last two and a half years. I've been losing again now.  I have a really hard time eating healthy though. I have days where I end up restricting pretty low for myself, and I end up wanting to eat an unhealthily low amount of food when I try to eat healthy, and I eventually end up bingeing and eating insane amounts of food after which defeats the purpose. To the point that I feel sick. Rinse. Repeat. I feel trapped in my body, and not like myself.",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",

When I was 15, I lost weight through diet alone (mostly). 3 weeks before my holiday in 2015, I practically starved myself because I was so scared I wasn't going to fit into the roller coasters and other rides there. I lost weight rapidly. \n\n5 years on, I gained all the weight and even more and now I have binge eating disorder quite badly. I honestly don't feel like I have an eating disorder because I'm so fat; it's like obese people can't get eating disorders. I do feel feel like it's about my lack of control, but it really isn't . It's just my faulty brain!",

I\u2019m glad to hear the atmosphere has chilled out a bit more now. When I was on there I felt like there was a level of competitiveness to some extent (but that\u2019s to be expected I suppose). But yeah I might go back, even if it\u2019s just for the nostalgia haha. & yeah that\u2019s what I was hoping for at first! I was *trying* to recover, literally because it got to the point that my hair was falling out. That was the final straw for me. But alcoholism & recovery was not a good mix haha. Hopefully one day I will be normal. It does suck balls tho, knowing that you\u2019ve undone months/years of progress, hard work & misery. All for nothing :/ good luck to u too.

We really want to stop, but can't!\n\nI was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.\n\nThen I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, \"bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!\" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.\n\nI had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.\n\nOne doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.\n\n**FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",
