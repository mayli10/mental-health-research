Then I got into this terrible relationship which caused the spiral and started restricting heavily but occasionally stuffing my face in my car and at night with all the junk I could get my hands on. Still lost quickly then got out of the relationship and put half the weight back on just bingeing. Slowly got back up to my current weight which I'm still trying to lose...\n\nOk that turned into a bit of a rant but long story short I've been stuck in a binge/restrict cycle for 2+ years and I mourn the days when I would eat like a normie aka overeat slightly and call it a \"binge lol\" and cancel it with a quick run the next day.",

Been on both sides of the fence; one feels like a crazed obsession, if I eat one calorie over I'm a disgusting failure who should just kill themselves immediately, complete inability to function rationally when it comes to food. The other feels like a chaotic, unpredictable hell state of constant disappointment and self-hatred, where I'm a fat disgusting failure who should just kill themselves immediately because I can't stop fucking eating/puking/whatever.\n\nHonestly I doubt anyone's trying to brag when they say stuff like that. It legit feels like the end of the world sometimes. I convinced myself I was gaining on 1000 kcal a day when I was really sick last year and had to \"recover\". Now I'm like...way over that and staying pretty steady somehow, so clearly I was wrong, but it didn't FEEL wrong. Reason has very little to do with it. I also get how competitive EDs can be though, and it can feel like people are trying to one-up each other sometimes. I don't think most people are though. Everyone feels like hell.",
