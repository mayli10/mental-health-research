She just seemed to be in a lot of denial about it and the video was kind of pointless. \n\nI think it would be great to see a video of her being super upfront and honest about it, but I don't expect that. It's her life, her mental health and her recovery. She doesn't owe the public and her viewers anything.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

You may not like him personally but him and Eugenia are friends and Shane is a nice person. She chose to do the video, whether she was actually ok or not was on her, point is she agreed to it. And I think he was making jokes about his own body because he was trying to diffuse the situation or make it less tense, because it was a serious topic. I don\u2019t remember him saying she looked healthy but again, not everyone has the mindset of someone with an ED so he was just saying what he thought was normal",

                        "Text": "Well, from the Jake Paul video, I don\u2019t find Kati to be very professional at all. And yeah Shane is very naive and made multiple off the wall comments. Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

Combine Shane and Eugenia\u2019s huge followings and that\u2019s a huge number of viewers, many of whom might be struggling with an ED or their body image.\n\nOutside of whether or not they were making a video, Shane\u2019s potentially triggering comments on his appearance to someone recovering from an ED were really lacking some basic situational and self-awareness...especially after an in-depth conversation beforehand to ensure he didn\u2019t trigger Eugenia.\n\nShane has come a really long way with his content, and I\u2019m proud of his progress. That being said, it\u2019s disappointing to see him completely miss that this situation and video was not the time for those specific jokes.\n\nEdit: wording.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated.

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

She genuinely seems to want to help and give him to the followers she knows she has that are also disordered but...yeah. The mental side of her recovery is still in a very early stage. Perhaps too early for this particular video but I do get why she might want to reach out and it has, at least as far as I have seen. earned her some positive public image points and good will from the general internet public who largely want to see her keep up her recovery. I have even noticed people avoiding saying she looks great/healthy in comments and focusing on other things. An effort from both her and Shane to garner support for her is a fairly valid goal, and I do think that was at least part of Shane's motivations.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated.

You may not like him personally but him and Eugenia are friends and Shane is a nice person. She chose to do the video, whether she was actually ok or not was on her, point is she agreed to it. And I think he was making jokes about his own body because he was trying to diffuse the situation or make it less tense, because it was a serious topic. I don\u2019t remember him saying she looked healthy but again, not everyone has the mindset of someone with an ED so he was just saying what he thought was normal",

                        "Text": "Well, from the Jake Paul video, I don\u2019t find Kati to be very professional at all. And yeah Shane is very naive and made multiple off the wall comments. Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

In both her video and Shane's she seemed super awkward although there were a few tiny moments when she seemed to kinda let her walls down, but not for long. Shane kind of annoyed me because he really made a lot of the video about himself BUT I do appreciate that he didn't push her and asked if any questions were off limits. Like girl was talkin bout \"I didn't notice I was emaciated\" and he didn't press her on that.\n\nFrom the outside this whole thing gives me vertigo because I feel like I wouldn't be ready to come back if I were her but I sincerely don't know what's going on inside her head and maybe she's ready to come back and leave this ED behind, maybe her recovery is still fragile. Bottom line is we have no idea and she has no obligation to tell us. It's cool that Shane gave her an opportunity to say what she wanted to say, even if she didn't say everything. But it still makes you wonder whether she did it for herself and others who may be suffering, or to appease the mass of people who think they have a right to know the details about her private life.\n\nPS: Shane joking about wishing he could to rehab to get his phone taken away from him and be given lots of food........... That was a bit tone deaf luv x",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

You may not like him personally but him and Eugenia are friends and Shane is a nice person. She chose to do the video, whether she was actually ok or not was on her, point is she agreed to it. And I think he was making jokes about his own body because he was trying to diffuse the situation or make it less tense, because it was a serious topic. I don\u2019t remember him saying she looked healthy but again, not everyone has the mindset of someone with an ED so he was just saying what he thought was normal",

                        "Text": "Well, from the Jake Paul video, I don\u2019t find Kati to be very professional at all. And yeah Shane is very naive and made multiple off the wall comments. Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

                        "Text": "Well, from the Jake Paul video, I don\u2019t find Kati to be very professional at all. And yeah Shane is very naive and made multiple off the wall comments. Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

She didn't go into details about how bad things were or could have been. In my opinion (and I don't say this meanly) it almost does the opposite, like at one point when she points out how her hair stayed so healthy. To me it low-key gave off the vibe that \"nothing bad happens\" and to someone who would be beginning to develop an eating disorder, it almost feels like \"proof\" that you're not always in a hospital, on the verge of dying and some people are \"just fine\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow we really have no idea what goes on behind the scenes. She blows it all off casually as if she didn't even realize she was anorexic or had an eating disorder and one day just realized it ... Maybe this is true, maybe not. That's none of my business. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just think that if they were going to do a video, it should have been a \"powerful\" one. This 1hr video could have been all said and done in 10-15 minutes, and didn't bring anything really \"positive\" or helpful to those suffering with eating disorders.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

                        "Text": "Well, from the Jake Paul video, I don\u2019t find Kati to be very professional at all. And yeah Shane is very naive and made multiple off the wall comments. Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

The video portrays her very favourably: as a really nice girl who is kinda funny and quirky, who was bullied in school and held onto that pain both in a very negative way (unhealthy coping mechanisms) and a less negative way (or at least an admirable way that has positive and negative sides in her absolute avoidance of confrontation, people-pleasing attitude and genuinely never wanting to cause pain or discomfort to others)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think it was a great video and Shane's attempts to lighten the tone and crack jokes were often inappropriate or outright misguided, and she was clearly not ready to discuss the reality of her ED and still is a degree of denial about it, but I don't think it was a total mess. She's been painted as this heartless anorexic who posts her body checks online and doesn't care about triggering her young audience for years. I think the video took a step towards showing her in a far more sympathetic light, probably a lot better than she could achieve on her own.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated.

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

Kati specifically said it wasn\u2019t a good idea to ask her how she was able to do so much, and he pretty much did anyway. He asked her if the people in the inpatient program were surprised by her energy level and everything. No one is perfect, and he was probably a little nervous and slipped up. But saying it was \u201ciconic\u201d for him to be in her room (basically joking that they are extreme opposites as he thinks of himself as large and she was very thin) and then saying he is the big hero 6 character, that was all ridiculous. I think Shane messed up a few times, but I don\u2019t expect him to be a professional interviewer or anything. He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

It\u2019s good to support people where they are at but to pretend like recovery is a discrete \u201cevent\u201d is really misguided and I feel that\u2019s how this has been treated. I think it needed to be talked about and it\u2019s a step in the right direction but missed the mark of offering realistic solutions to future scenarios which are going to occur, and that\u2019s what a responsible documentary ends with in my opinion.",

He\u2019s a YouTuber and all the people he does these documentaries on are also youtubers so it just seems to me like they get it. Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

My perspective is, she wanted to come back to YouTube and address things but still keep them private. Maybe the thing with Shane just made her more comfortable because she was able to address it and sort of answer questions, but not be the only focus of the video. I think she would have been overwhelmed by a million comments if she just made a video about some clothes and didn\u2019t address it at all. Her \u201cI\u2019m back\u201d video was short and people still would have asked. I think Shane\u2019s video was helpful because you had Kati in the beginning telling him not to say she looks good. She kind of explained how an ED patient would hear those sort of compliments. So while it wasn\u2019t perfect, and I think Shane could have done a lot of things better, I didn\u2019t completely hate it.\n\nEdited to add: I know when I want to do something, my therapist will sometimes suggest that I do it with a friend. It helps break the ice. That\u2019s just what this seems like to me. She probably thought returning to making videos would be productive and good for her because she enjoys them. She wanted to get back into it. So to do that, she helped someone break the ice to return.",

Especially since Shane and Eugenia has prior contact even before her getting help, even if it wasn\u2019t much. \nAs for her being disordered, she has an eating disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean she is completely incapable of consenting to anything. If that were the case, I\u2019d assume her mother would be there because that would mean Eugenia is thought to not be capable of making any medical or legal decisions for herself. And Eugenia\u2019s lawyer was there. We also don\u2019t know if she is still seeing a therapist regularly, which I assume she is, who discussed this with her. Eugenia was going to return to YouTube with or without the Shane documentary whether it was too soon or not. And only Eugenia and her team can say if it is too soon or not.",

                "Text": "Agree with you on all counts.\n\nI don't follow Shane, didn't watch his video, might never do. But I would like to watch hers anyway at some point, when I'm in a better place mentally.\n\nSo, I'm not talking about those videos specifically, I'm talking about the whole YouTube community reaction to her situation.\n\nAnd, about that, the one thing I would like to add, that I think you were already implying anyway, is that if any of these people really are concerned about her and wish her well, they shouldn't be putting out content about her.\n\nNot even positive content. Not now, or anytime soon anyway. Recovery is  hard, needs a lot of work and can be *very* fragile, sometimes even for people who are months and years into it. Any comment about her appearance that she can read can be potentially detrimental to her recovery. Multiply that by youtube numbers. Not good. \n\nOf course, she probably shouldn't be watching those videos or reading those comments in the first place, but you never know. And free speech obviously exists, and they can say and write whatever they want, but they should be aware that that makes it about them, their feelings, their impressions etc. They're making it about themselves, not her. Cause, again, if they had her best interest in mind 99% of those people \u2014 who don't really know her \u2014 should just shut the fuck up, gossip about her in the privacy of their group chats or whatever, and leave her alone.\n\nIf you're a fan, were genuinely concerned, are happy she's back etc. a short comment or message of well wishes WITHOUT MENTIONING HER CURRENT OR PAST APPEARANCE is enough to let her know she is loved and appreciated.\n\nNot only she doesn't owe anything to anyone, but if you claim to care about Eugenia you owe it to her to be very mindful of what you say about her and her story.\n\nEdit: spelling",
