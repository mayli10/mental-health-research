I'm constantly paranoid my household scale is wrong because there's no way in hell i can be the weight I supposedly am and look like i do.

My average for the last week has been about 1200 (not including exercise) and today was one of the only days i've restricted under 600 in the last 3 weeks. I'm 5'1 and i get so fucking jealous that tall people have such higher TDEEs. \n\nI get triggered on this sub and by other ed content but it's still not enough. I still fucking eat, i just hate myself exponentially more afterwards. And it's not like i've ever been able to purge either, just exercise until my lazy ass gives up after tonight's pitiful 70 minutes of jumping jacks.\n\nI feel like a fucking fraud even posting here. I'm not even skinny. I can barely see my collar bones and i'd be lucky to catch a *glimpse* of a shadow of my rib cage with perfect lighting from above.
