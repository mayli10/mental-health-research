Even if you begin without the predisposition, if you drink enough or starve enough, *you will induce symptoms anyways.*\n\nIf staff in relevant groups cracked down on shit like \"yay I didn't eat for a month\" and \"let's compete to see longest fasts\", that'd be one thing.

It makes me fucking scared for them and super pissed off at the people who (so defensively!!!!) insist that NOT EATING FOR CONSECUTIVE WEEKS ISN'T SO EXTREMELY DISORDERED THAT IT BORDERS ON SATIRE.\n\nThat's the kind of lifestyle that dumbasses expect when they get surprised that someone with an eating disorder still eats so they don't fall into gradual linear death. I thought nobody actually *had* that lifestyle for more than brief period(s) of rock bottom during their life, since that tends to end before long in hospitalization - for a rainbow of reasons, but there's also communities online that drink their own piss and call it medicine, so here we are I guess.\n\nBlack salve. Anti-vaccination. People can get away with so much life-endangering, permanent-damage-causing, glorified-with-pseudoscience crap nowadays if they claim it's for \"self-improvement\". Or \"health\", and by \"health\" we mean \"thin\" or \"cured from the illness that's made you so desperate that you're willing to try anything\".\n\nThe very nature of these communities preys on vulnerable, insecure people who would probably cut pieces of themselves off with scissors instead of starvation if it would guarantee them feeling okay again.\n\nThey should be learning how and why to accept the people they already are, not just skipping meals and losing as much muscle as fat. Or trying to escape death then dying from the wounds that caused, re:holistic \"medicine\".\n\nI think that's why I genuinely hate cults of false hope. Some communities are like...okay, you're garbage, but you'll always exist so it might as well be under a rock. NAMBLA? Yeah, sure, let pedos out themselves so we can know who to avoid like herpes.\n\n *This* shit needs to lose its fucking publicity.\n\nPro-anorexia. Literally just pro-anorexia that doesn't admit it's pro-anorexia because pro-anorexia is bad.",

I wonder how many pursue too much fasting/too long, attain some of it, get results because basic CICO, and then walk around crowing about how great it was to pursue the original goal.\n\nIf they are disordered, I genuinely feel for them a whole lot more. I'm here. It's not like I haven't ended up hooked on my own baited hooks. But I know a wriggling worm at this point when I see one.",

A beer here or there, and then one night of going out drinking. In a night we might consume the same number of drinks, but it's a different behavior.\n\nIn the same way, fasters may fast for a month and then switch to 16:8 to maintain. That month was extreme, but might not be disordered. \n\nThe thing is, it's not my place to worry or judge. I think \"normal\" eaters are just as bad. At some point we need to be taught about calories and portion control, but the obsession some people have with food on the 1200 subs rivals me at my absolute worst with my ED. So it sucks we are self aware and call a spade a spade whereas other groups can't do the same, but I guess it doesn't bother me at all anymore. I don't worry about them I try to be encouraging when there aren't huge ED-thought red flags. I have a complicated relationship with food (why I'm on this sub and fasting subs), and I always will, maybe these people are like me.",

Yes. Verbatim. Willpower.\n\nDon't tell me that wasn't the most classic fucking mindset at work.\n\nMaybe some people somewhere can carefully use overhyped moderate restriction to just skip meals once in a while. Sure. Of course, every slippery slope has a peak, and for those reasons, they might as well try veganism. Or anything else that boils down to the simple benefit of \"cut out some food, lose some weight\".\n\nWorth mentioning that EDs have an increasingly documented genetic link, like alcoholism, that can theoretically be triggered by a catalyst from a dormant predisposition...like purposeful restriction in a non-disordered person.\n\nAnd let's not even start with the amount of people who know they have disorders, but still step into those groups....and don't stick out much.\n\nThe Minnesota Starvation Experiment alone justifies not trusting \"it's a mental disorder\" to protect *even genuinely non-disordered people* from developing symptoms *as a response* if they go too far anyways.

A beer here or there, and then one night of going out drinking. In a night we might consume the same number of drinks, but it's a different behavior.\n\nIn the same way, fasters may fast for a month and then switch to 16:8 to maintain. That month was extreme, but might not be disordered. \n\nThe thing is, it's not my place to worry or judge. I think \"normal\" eaters are just as bad. At some point we need to be taught about calories and portion control, but the obsession some people have with food on the 1200 subs rivals me at my absolute worst with my ED. So it sucks we are self aware and call a spade a spade whereas other groups can't do the same, but I guess it doesn't bother me at all anymore. I don't worry about them I try to be encouraging when there aren't huge ED-thought red flags. I have a complicated relationship with food (why I'm on this sub and fasting subs), and I always will, maybe these people are like me.",

Fat people are lazy! I'd kms if I was like that again, but thank god I have control over the situation now. Anyways, what do you guys do when you get dizzy?

Yes. Verbatim. Willpower.\n\nDon't tell me that wasn't the most classic fucking mindset at work.\n\nMaybe some people somewhere can carefully use overhyped moderate restriction to just skip meals once in a while. Sure. Of course, every slippery slope has a peak, and for those reasons, they might as well try veganism. Or anything else that boils down to the simple benefit of \"cut out some food, lose some weight\".\n\nWorth mentioning that EDs have an increasingly documented genetic link, like alcoholism, that can theoretically be triggered by a catalyst from a dormant predisposition...like purposeful restriction in a non-disordered person.\n\nAnd let's not even start with the amount of people who know they have disorders, but still step into those groups....and don't stick out much.\n\nThe Minnesota Starvation Experiment alone justifies not trusting \"it's a mental disorder\" to protect *even genuinely non-disordered people* from developing symptoms *as a response* if they go too far anyways.

Nobody is saying that everyone who diets must have disordered eating, or that wanting to follow a certain diet is the same as having an ED, they're saying that there are lots and lots of people within dieting communities for whom the only difference between their eating habits and an eating disorder is a formal diagnosis.\n\nIn short, yes, of course there is a difference between having an eating disorder, having disordered eating, and merely following a diet (even if the diet is extreme), but people can still have eating disorders/disordered eating without identifying it as such.",
