I struggle in the exact same ways, though my vyvanse is prescribed for treatment resistant depression as well, which means that when I come off of it for ED reasons, my ED is intensified by ten because of the depression (but no one seems to listen to me when I tell them that). For me, attention issues related to ADHD and depression get way way WAY worse when I\u2019m restricting. I feel like it\u2019s a really confusing catch-22, though. When I\u2019m not medicated, I get depressed and fall deeper into ED, but the meds also help me to restrict when I\u2019m in that state of mind. My opinion is that no one who is properly medicated for a legitimate problem should have their meds suddenly ripped away just because of an ED unless the ED only exists because of the adderall/vyvanse/whatever, or in severe cases as a short-term solution. I think we have to just learn to be honest with ourselves and our treatment teams about how meds affect us and learn to cope with those urges. No one can save us but ourselves, but we have to be properly medicated.",
