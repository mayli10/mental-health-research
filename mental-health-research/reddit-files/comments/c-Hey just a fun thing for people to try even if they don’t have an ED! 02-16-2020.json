Like if I say 'I'm gonna eat something' he'll say 'I'm not hungry' and it's like OK first I didn't ask you and we don't share a stomach, but also now I feel guilty and fat about being hungry and wanting to eat. And yesterday I went to get my 2 bites of leftovers from the night before and he tried to convince me to wait until dinner, like why are you encouraging me to skip meals and ignore my hunger signals when you know I'm trying to recover from a restrictive eating disorder??? I know why, it's because I'm fat now.",
