I mean sure plenty of people may be able to fast and maintain a healthier mindset about their bodies, but I also think a lot of people are so desperate to lose weight quickly that they will do anything and get dysphoric if they mess up. Half the time I can't tell the difference between 1200isplenty and the ED subs. People talk about extreme guilt from going over their calorie limits, thoughts of purging, fasting or exercising for hours to make up for going over their limit, fear of binging. I'm not sure about other people here, but that's the kind of mindset and behavior that led me to develop an ED. Fifteen years later, and I still have a fucked up relationship with food and my body. I can't even diet in a \"healthy\" way without having a breakdown over food when things go wrong.",

In our last meeting someone brought up how no one rags on normies who go 20 hours without food and then pound a whole day\u2019s food in a single meal.  The dietitian and the therapist were both like, no, that\u2019s not really a good idea for most non-ED people either, it puts them at risk of developing an ED.\n\nSo, like, the people with the double standard are the ones putting their fingers in their ears and straight out denying that there\u2019s any risks to their behaviour.  It\u2019s pure denialism and I don\u2019t take them seriously.  They have as many irrational beliefs about food and body as we do, but less self-awareness",

That being said, I struggle with disordered eating and use IF to reduce calories to 1000 or less per day so it\u2019s not technically \u201cokay\u201d the way I do it, but it\u2019s fine for people who track their calories to a T to maintain weight or gain muscle.",
