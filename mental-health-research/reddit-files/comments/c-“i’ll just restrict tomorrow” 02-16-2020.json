Allowed me to continue using the act of grazing as a way to distract myself when I was bored or upset or whatever\n\n2. Gave me a good visual of how much I would eat when I was \"just grazing\"\n\n3. I almost never actually wanted to eat it the next morning\n\n4. When I did eat it, it was usually in days I had designated as binge days, and it was already a perfect mix of everything I'd been craving or wanting, so just eating the whole bowl would be incredibly satisfying and I think resulted in me eating less than if I had started the binge on a clean slate of \"okay what do I want\"\n\nBut then I moved home and I couldn't just leave a bowl of food I'm actively not eating in the kitchen at my parents' house lol",
