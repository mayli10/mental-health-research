It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change.

With an eating disorder its not only that you're physically smaller on the outside but you're lacking the vital nutrients for survival on the inside. So theres barely any energy to spare for anything other than just staying alive. And on top of that it's a mental disorder so your mind is constantly on food. When you ate, how much you ate, when will you eat next, how much will you eat, what exercise will you do to burn it off, when will you do that exercise, etc. It's a miserable life.",

It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis.

I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha.

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

Because \"fruit has carbs so it's bad for you\" is the one diet hill I WILL die on. Anyone who says that in front of me is liable to get eaten",

I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking.

It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis.

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha.

I know some people interpret it like you, \"Do I want to eat this calorific food that will feel good temporarily but set back my weight loss/maintenance, or would I rather stay on track?\", but a lot of people (especially people with EDs) internalise it as \"I *can't* enjoy a balance of tasty food because I feel guilty for eating anything over XX calories in case it interrupts my weight loss, because being/staying skinny is more important than ever enjoying food.\"\n\nLike... that's the disordered part of an eating disorder. I know exactly why some people would take meaning and inspiration from the quote (I won't lie, I do too sometimes when I'm staring down the barrel of a binge) and still manage a healthy balance with enjoying food, but it's also a highly exploitable quote for impressionable and scared people.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking. My dream is to be a fit 135, but going to the gym causes me so much dread.\n\nI was all over the place. Lots of fasting or aiming for 500 calories, with some normal days, and lots of bping. It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis. I still eat everything I want to, but I lack a lot of intuition as far as moderation goes.",

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",

I know some people interpret it like you, \"Do I want to eat this calorific food that will feel good temporarily but set back my weight loss/maintenance, or would I rather stay on track?\", but a lot of people (especially people with EDs) internalise it as \"I *can't* enjoy a balance of tasty food because I feel guilty for eating anything over XX calories in case it interrupts my weight loss, because being/staying skinny is more important than ever enjoying food.\"\n\nLike... that's the disordered part of an eating disorder. I know exactly why some people would take meaning and inspiration from the quote (I won't lie, I do too sometimes when I'm staring down the barrel of a binge) and still manage a healthy balance with enjoying food, but it's also a highly exploitable quote for impressionable and scared people.",

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL.

It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge.

It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices.

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha.

                "Text": "I think there are a few moments after/during weight loss where you feel amazing, mostly because of a brief sense of value and achievement in society's eyes. But the process of becoming and staying skinny rarely ever feels good. Health issues aside, I feel miserable all the time, even if I don't feel actively hungry. I am moodier and angrier and less pleasant to be around, even if I'm more pleasant to look at.\n\nI don't think skinny really feels good, especially not \"skinny\" the way we understand it. What feels good is the value other people place on that skinniness and how we internalise it.\n\nDidn't Kate Moss herself say she really regrets ever saying that?",

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

It doesn't seem to matter what it is - you get one camp of so-called experts decrying it as the worst substance you can possibly consume and another camp touting it as the most amazing thing you can do for your body.

Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis.

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha.

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

Glad to hear that you eat intuitively and haven't BPd for a year :) I'm not sure I'll ever be comfortable eating intuitively and doing so without gaining a lot of weight. I can pack away a good amount of food. Especially now with being so lean, if I go on a binge it can get gross. Luckily I have those under control 98% of the time. For me, if it's on the plate I'll eat it and after being overweight for so long the thought of going back there is the scariest thing.",

I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking. My dream is to be a fit 135, but going to the gym causes me so much dread.\n\nI was all over the place. Lots of fasting or aiming for 500 calories, with some normal days, and lots of bping. It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis. I still eat everything I want to, but I lack a lot of intuition as far as moderation goes.",

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",

Then there would be food at the party which would take 50% of my mental effort to avoid, so I couldn't socialize properly. And if I snapped and ate food, my look would be \"ruined\" by my protruding stomach.\n\nNow I just go to parties and wear whatever, and have fun conversations and sometimes drink a little too much, and if there's food I might have some, but it's barely a passing thought because I'm not starving and food-obsessed.

But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change.

I'm always cold so I layer up, but otherwise I don't think my arma/shoulders/chest look scary, but when I'm lifting damn I see how lean I've become and exactly how much muscle I've developed, which is a good thing, but I wonder how much more muscle I could have developed after 2 years of consistent training.\n\nHow were you maintaining at 125? Glad to hear that you eat intuitively and haven't BPd for a year :) I'm not sure I'll ever be comfortable eating intuitively and doing so without gaining a lot of weight. I can pack away a good amount of food. Especially now with being so lean, if I go on a binge it can get gross. Luckily I have those under control 98% of the time. For me, if it's on the plate I'll eat it and after being overweight for so long the thought of going back there is the scariest thing.",

I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking. My dream is to be a fit 135, but going to the gym causes me so much dread.\n\nI was all over the place. Lots of fasting or aiming for 500 calories, with some normal days, and lots of bping. It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis. I still eat everything I want to, but I lack a lot of intuition as far as moderation goes.",

                            "Text": "Thanks :) I want my focus to be on what my body can do rather than how it looks. I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices.

                            "Text": "Thanks :) I want my focus to be on what my body can do rather than how it looks. I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change.

It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices.

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha.

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change.

It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis.

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha.

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL.

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

                        "Text": "That's awesome that you're gaining muscle! I have gone through kicks of taking exercise seriously, but kind of fell off. I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking. My dream is to be a fit 135, but going to the gym causes me so much dread.\n\nI was all over the place. Lots of fasting or aiming for 500 calories, with some normal days, and lots of bping. It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis. I still eat everything I want to, but I lack a lot of intuition as far as moderation goes.",

                            "Text": "Thanks :) I want my focus to be on what my body can do rather than how it looks. I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices.

I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

I'm always cold so I layer up, but otherwise I don't think my arma/shoulders/chest look scary, but when I'm lifting damn I see how lean I've become and exactly how much muscle I've developed, which is a good thing, but I wonder how much more muscle I could have developed after 2 years of consistent training.\n\nHow were you maintaining at 125? Glad to hear that you eat intuitively and haven't BPd for a year :) I'm not sure I'll ever be comfortable eating intuitively and doing so without gaining a lot of weight. I can pack away a good amount of food. Especially now with being so lean, if I go on a binge it can get gross. Luckily I have those under control 98% of the time. For me, if it's on the plate I'll eat it and after being overweight for so long the thought of going back there is the scariest thing.",

I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking. My dream is to be a fit 135, but going to the gym causes me so much dread.\n\nI was all over the place. Lots of fasting or aiming for 500 calories, with some normal days, and lots of bping. It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis. I still eat everything I want to, but I lack a lot of intuition as far as moderation goes.",

                            "Text": "Thanks :) I want my focus to be on what my body can do rather than how it looks. I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",

It's hard to find a good balance between the toxic aspects of diet culture (e.g. the OG quote) but still acknowledging that there are lots of benefits to analysing what and how we eat and whether it's actually serving us. Like, I don't necessarily think it's good or helpful to beat myself up for eating food that's \"too calorific\" or whatever. But I also know that I have a lot of unhealthy fixations with foods and I use food as a crutch for other emotional issues, and fixing the root cause of the problem and being able to self-talk like \"am I hungry or just bored?\", \"am I really craving this specific thing or am I craving something it contains that could be satisfied some other way?\", or \"do I really want this food or do I just feel anxious about the concept of it being 'taken away' from me?\" is ultimately healthier for me.\n\nLike, I know that diet culture leads really easily into EDs, but BED is also an ED and refusing to encourage any work to minimise binges or reframe my eating is basically refusing to treat an ED...\n\nSorry that was a tangent LOL. I like your quote a lot though because boredom eating, or emotional eating, are both really big problems that I think would be a lot more effective for weight loss than scaremongering.",

My face is definitely sunken and gaunt looking, but tbh I love the cheekbones I've developed and that dark shadow on my cheeks. I am most fearful of losing my sculpted face if I gain weight lol. For about a week now I've been taking an omega 3 supplement and eating more healthy fats (since my diet has been very low fat for a while) in hopes that it will help my energy levels, and give more of a glow to my skin. Since June I've increased my calories to 1800 too. I still feel pretty dead even eating 1800, probably because I'm so active. I haven't noticed any weight gain either but have been consistently around 126 rather than seeing dumb fluctuations from as low as 122 to as high as 128. What were you maintaining on?",

It's hard to leave because when it feels good, it feels REALLY good, and you kid yourself into thinking it can be like that all the time if you can just change. But the reality that you can see once you step back a bit from that abusive relationship is that you can achieve those same highs elsewhere without all the crushing, devastating lows that used to be your norm.\n\nCongrats on maintaining at a place that does you good!!",

I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking. My dream is to be a fit 135, but going to the gym causes me so much dread.\n\nI was all over the place. Lots of fasting or aiming for 500 calories, with some normal days, and lots of bping. It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.\n\nI've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis. I still eat everything I want to, but I lack a lot of intuition as far as moderation goes.",

                            "Text": "Thanks :) I want my focus to be on what my body can do rather than how it looks. I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.\n\nI'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.\n\nSometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.\n\nI used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",
