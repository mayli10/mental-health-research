I accidentally bought regular strength recently because the bottle was twice as big (so more than twice the volume) for twice the cost, but when I realized it wasn't Extra Strength I did the math and you only get 5 extra doses and pay twice as much for it.

                "Text": "Dude any cough syrup where you have to take 10ml for a dose is a scam. You'll pay the same price for something that's 3x or 6x as effective. Also my favourite cough syrup, Dimetapp Extra Strength, is sweetened with sorbitol which means it's far less calorie-dense while also only being 5ml per dose. And I find that it works a lot better than most cough syrups I've tried. The only caveat is that it doesn't help with chest congestion. It's great for runny nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion, but if you've been experiencing post-nasal drip you'll probably want something else like Robitussin which is better for coughing and chest congestion. Robitussin doesn't come in grape flavour though. I find it doesn't help as much with sinus congestion too. I don't know what non-medicinal ingredients are in Robitussin though. I just know that it's more concentrated which means less syrup and more medicine. Less syrup typically means fewer calories too.",

Apparently it's hard to find in some places because one time I got sick while visiting my dad and he couldn't find some anywhere and ended up picking up some Tylenol cough syrup that was like 5.5 doses per bottle. It was 30ml per dose, tasted awful, and didn't do anything to help me. I do specifically recommend Dimetapp Extra Strength though. I accidentally bought regular strength recently because the bottle was twice as big (so more than twice the volume) for twice the cost, but when I realized it wasn't Extra Strength I did the math and you only get 5 extra doses and pay twice as much for it. (*20 doses of ES to 25 of regular.*)\n\nBut yeah I get sick a lot, so I kinda need to know what work for me. :l",

Apparently it's hard to find in some places because one time I got sick while visiting my dad and he couldn't find some anywhere and ended up picking up some Tylenol cough syrup that was like 5.5 doses per bottle. It was 30ml per dose, tasted awful, and didn't do anything to help me. I do specifically recommend Dimetapp Extra Strength though. I accidentally bought regular strength recently because the bottle was twice as big (so more than twice the volume) for twice the cost, but when I realized it wasn't Extra Strength I did the math and you only get 5 extra doses and pay twice as much for it. (*20 doses of ES to 25 of regular.*)\n\nBut yeah I get sick a lot, so I kinda need to know what work for me. :l",

Tasting good and making you feel way better is a bad combo for over the counter medicine, especially for someone with allergies like mine because that means it will always be helpful even if I'm not sick. I do my best to only take it when I really need it. The child-proof cap definitely helps with that. There have been times I needed it and didn't take it because I couldn't get it open...",
