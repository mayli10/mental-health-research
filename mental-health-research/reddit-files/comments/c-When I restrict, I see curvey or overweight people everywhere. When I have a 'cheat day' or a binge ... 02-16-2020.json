I obviously don't voice these opinions or express them in any way shape or form because I realize they're toxic, but I get triggered by curvier people.

I gained back all the weight I lost through a heavy restriction period in the winter and I am so uncomfortable in my own skin and desperate to get back to my thinner self.
