Edgelords are a dime a dozen.\n\nI like the sincerity here. And the lack of one-upmanship. We're all just doing our best, getting by, and reaching out for advice/jokes/commiseration. Good stuff.",

That comment was again, in defense of sex changes, saying people should be able to whatever they want with their bodies. The \u201clizard person\u201d was in reference to a man who literally got plastic surgery to look like a lizard. \n\n\u201cYoung trans people\u201d and children under 12 are slightly different things and the decision should be left to a medical professional to determine if the patient has gender dysphoria. \n\nYou think glorifying gender dysphoria is a good thing? Im talking about that the same way people say dont glorify EDs. Its not a \u201cfun trendy thing\u201d\n\n\nDo you really not understand context?",
