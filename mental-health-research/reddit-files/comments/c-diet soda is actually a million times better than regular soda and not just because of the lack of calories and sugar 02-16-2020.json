The US limits the amount of sugar that is allowed to be sold by US producers and puts a high tax/tariff on sugar imports. \n\nWe are literally paying corn farmers with our taxes to grow shitty crops (inedible to humans!) that we have to turn into a highly processed syrup in order to use while artificially raising the price of sugar. That\u2019s also part of why our meat quality is so shit: *over 40%* of low quality corn in the US goes to animal feed.",

The US limits the amount of sugar that is allowed to be sold by US producers and puts a high tax/tariff on sugar imports. \n\nWe are literally paying corn farmers with our taxes to grow shitty crops (inedible to humans!) that we have to turn into a highly processed syrup in order to use while artificially raising the price of sugar. That\u2019s also part of why our meat quality is so shit: *over 40%* of low quality corn in the US goes to animal feed.",
