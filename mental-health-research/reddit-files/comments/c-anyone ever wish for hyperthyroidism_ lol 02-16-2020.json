When my graves was at its worst I was not allowed to exercise at all because I was in real danger of a heart attack.\n\nAlthough I've had my thyroid removed so I'm hypothyroid now I have horrible lasting issues from too much thyroid hormone 6 years post op. You can get protruding eyes like me, and once you have them there is nothing that can be done to reduce it except a risky eye surgery that is only done when you can't close your eyes anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention that i was actually going insane because I was so anxious all the time with my heart beating so fast that i was supper paranoid about everything. Also my thyroid swelled up to like 10x the normal size and my neck looked disgusting even my mom cringed when I wasn't wearing a scarf and my surgeon said I had the biggest thyroid he's ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts like all cons honestly",
