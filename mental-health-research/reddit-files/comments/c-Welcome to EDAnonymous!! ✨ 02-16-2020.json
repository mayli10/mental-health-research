Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

I'm an Internet Old Person (late 30s) but this is literally the only place in real life or virtually where I can find other people that are battling their ED demons. There is nothing else like the support that this community provides and I truly think it's saved lives (and mental marbles!) among those of us that are fighting ED monsters every day. Doesn't matter how big/small/old etc, everyone's got their private battles and this seems like the only place where many of us can take a breath and let out the anxiety, the pain, the fear, the frustration, to a group of people who actually GET IT.  \n\n&#x200B;",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Where the fuck am I going to talk about feeling proud of myself for NOT throwing up that Impromptu brunch? Where the fuck am I going to talk about therapists and food fears and weight concerns. Where the fuck am I going to talk about feeling safe in my skinnier body but also wanting to not be afraid of food. What the fucking fuck. Who else is going to understand me? My fucking therapist sure doesn't. None of my friends do. Not even my partner truly gets it. And I don't want to run over to that overly proana mpa site because frankly I'm a goddamn adult and I don't want to hear the \"ermagher please teach me to purgee\" bullshit I had to listen to back when I was a teenager.

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

This prob includes sharing thinspo or bonespo :/\n\n- emphasise that we\u2019re about harm minimisation and supporting the person not the disorder\n\n- keep controversial topics on the relative downlow so we don\u2019t get brigaded by non-ED folk who stumble across the sub.

I just found so much comfort in reading everyone\u2019s posts every day. I felt like a part of the community, even though I was still too shy to speak up before it disappeared. I found everyone to be so smart, witty, supportive, and very focused on harm reduction and emotional support. Even though we\u2019re all coping with a mental illness, it helped to have a place to feel less alone and share the daily struggles. Other mental disorders still have active subs.

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

Almost every post was about how someone hated their lives and didn't see the point in anything, and all the comments were people throwing out their own stories of how they hated their lives more. Nobody really seemed to care or listen to anyone else and I guess that just comes with the territory of being depressed but it still felt really wrong. At least in proed when you ranted about why life sucked, there'd be a ton of supporting voices that made you not feel so alone and sad. ",

I felt so alone and wanted to cry at work but I couldn't. I have no one else around me that really truly understands what I'm going through. I haven't even told my therapist because I'm scared. My boyfriend knows I struggle with disordered eating but doesnt know that I am relapsing.

Because you can go on about how important recovery is, but if people are pressured into it when they aren't ready, that's just setting them up for a relapse.\n\nanyway rant over i guess??? lmfao. either way I'm super glad to see this, like I said in the beginning rofl",
