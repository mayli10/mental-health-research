                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

                        "Text": "Textbooks and professors arent always right. For instance you also have the statement that fasting reduces BMR. Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

While I actually was right about a lot of things, I soon realized that the obsessive nature of my EDs distorted the facts and made a lot of different health claims far more exaggerated. I would cling to and fixate on the tiniest bits of insignificant evidence because it satisfied my obsessive compulsive tendencies and rituals. I suppose the silver lining in having experienced this is that I can understand the psychology of consumer-driven behavior in diet and exercise marketing, and why it can be so hard to accept professional advice.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

                            "Text": "But the thing is, people can seem healthy for years while eating quite a lot of unhealthy foods. If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

                        "Text": "Textbooks and professors arent always right. For instance you also have the statement that fasting reduces BMR. Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

While I actually was right about a lot of things, I soon realized that the obsessive nature of my EDs distorted the facts and made a lot of different health claims far more exaggerated. I would cling to and fixate on the tiniest bits of insignificant evidence because it satisfied my obsessive compulsive tendencies and rituals. I suppose the silver lining in having experienced this is that I can understand the psychology of consumer-driven behavior in diet and exercise marketing, and why it can be so hard to accept professional advice.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

                            "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not.

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

                            "Text": "But the thing is, people can seem healthy for years while eating quite a lot of unhealthy foods. If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

While I actually was right about a lot of things, I soon realized that the obsessive nature of my EDs distorted the facts and made a lot of different health claims far more exaggerated. I would cling to and fixate on the tiniest bits of insignificant evidence because it satisfied my obsessive compulsive tendencies and rituals. I suppose the silver lining in having experienced this is that I can understand the psychology of consumer-driven behavior in diet and exercise marketing, and why it can be so hard to accept professional advice.",

                            "Text": "But the thing is, people can seem healthy for years while eating quite a lot of unhealthy foods. If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

I actually did follow her diet for about 6 weeks and gained 15 lbs.\n\nAnyway, just remember that, although the scientific method is what we aspire to use perfectly to find truths about our world, a science textbook is just written by a guy or two who had strong enough feelings about a subject to write a book about it. And nutrition is a very young and imperfect science. It's not just chemistry or thermodynamics where you can exclude all the conflicting variables and say definitively that a gram of carbon is this many atoms.\n\n We are, for instance, just starting to put 2 and 2 together about how your gut bacteria affects your weight, health, and even mental health. People who studied that 30 years ago were snickered at for being old fashioned or a little bit whackjob. \n\nMy advice is to focus on the core science in the book (as much as it has lol) for yourself and research further from the bibliography.

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

                        "Text": "Textbooks and professors arent always right. For instance you also have the statement that fasting reduces BMR. Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

While I actually was right about a lot of things, I soon realized that the obsessive nature of my EDs distorted the facts and made a lot of different health claims far more exaggerated. I would cling to and fixate on the tiniest bits of insignificant evidence because it satisfied my obsessive compulsive tendencies and rituals. I suppose the silver lining in having experienced this is that I can understand the psychology of consumer-driven behavior in diet and exercise marketing, and why it can be so hard to accept professional advice.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

                        "Text": "Textbooks and professors arent always right. For instance you also have the statement that fasting reduces BMR. Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

                            "Text": "But the thing is, people can seem healthy for years while eating quite a lot of unhealthy foods. If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

While I actually was right about a lot of things, I soon realized that the obsessive nature of my EDs distorted the facts and made a lot of different health claims far more exaggerated. I would cling to and fixate on the tiniest bits of insignificant evidence because it satisfied my obsessive compulsive tendencies and rituals. I suppose the silver lining in having experienced this is that I can understand the psychology of consumer-driven behavior in diet and exercise marketing, and why it can be so hard to accept professional advice.",

                            "Text": "But the thing is, people can seem healthy for years while eating quite a lot of unhealthy foods. If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

While I actually was right about a lot of things, I soon realized that the obsessive nature of my EDs distorted the facts and made a lot of different health claims far more exaggerated. I would cling to and fixate on the tiniest bits of insignificant evidence because it satisfied my obsessive compulsive tendencies and rituals. I suppose the silver lining in having experienced this is that I can understand the psychology of consumer-driven behavior in diet and exercise marketing, and why it can be so hard to accept professional advice.",

                        "Text": "But the thing is, people can seem healthy for years while eating quite a lot of unhealthy foods. If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

                        "Text": "Yeah for sure! My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.\n\nJokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting. \n\nI only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being \"healthy\". \n\nNothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah. It's a weird dynamic in the nutrition arena. Take everything with a grain of salt (lol)",

                        "Text": "Textbooks and professors arent always right. For instance you also have the statement that fasting reduces BMR. Most research has been pointing to the opposite until you crest the 72 hour mark.\n\nAnother easily debatable statement is how it was said that dietary fat is easily transformed into body fat. Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.\n\nOne of the more interesting things to me that i made a big deal about in class was that metabolizing from glycogen took one less glucose input than metabolizing from dietary glucose. My professor couldnt understand why i so persistent on clarifying that.",

I would cling to and fixate on the tiniest bits of insignificant evidence because it satisfied my obsessive compulsive tendencies and rituals. I suppose the silver lining in having experienced this is that I can understand the psychology of consumer-driven behavior in diet and exercise marketing, and why it can be so hard to accept professional advice.",

If you\u2019re active and not overweight and you don\u2019t have other unhealthy habits, then you are not doing as much damage as a lot of other people. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t still doi nog damage. The damage is incremental and takes years to actually kill you. If she was over 65 and had been eating that way her whole life and she had been tested for many health issues, well then that might mean something. But I think you could attribute that to her personal genetics having a protective effect rather than her diet being \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nAlso, just because her autoimmune disease were \u201ccured\u201d by her diet doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t come back. It could also be partly the placebo effect making her think that her symptoms aren\u2019t as bad. Particularly for her depression, there are a lot of reasons why that could go away that are not related to dietary changes, and again, there is the placebo effect, which you can\u2019t discount when you are talking about 1 person. There are so many explanations and variables that can\u2019t be discounted, that you really can\u2019t say that her story \u201cdisproves\u201d all conventional nutritional science. \n\nReally, if you\u2019re a biochemist as you claim, then you should know better that you can\u2019t make claims like that. It\u2019s never as simple as you want it to be. Sure, there may be a lot of bias in research, but is ALL research biased?? No, certainly not. You can look up many current studies and look at conflicts of interest if you don\u2019t believe me. The world isn\u2019t all a huge conspiracy.",

U talk shit abt nutrition science being funded by corportation, as if your influencer doesnt have conflict of interest.    \n   \nAt least nutrition science has some actual scientist behind it and not just some middle aged unemployed lady/housewive trying to guilt you into buying her diet. Were you one of those people who sold herbalife?   \n  \nIf you know anything abt the science of biology, you would have more respect to it.",
