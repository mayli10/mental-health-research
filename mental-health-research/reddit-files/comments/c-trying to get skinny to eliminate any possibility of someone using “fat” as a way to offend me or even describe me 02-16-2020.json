I was constantly being called fat, a cow, people would make fun of what I was eating and ask if 'I really needed it' etc. Usually just random people, sometimes strangers, trying to make their friends laugh. This was at least once a week.\n\nHaving spent my formative years wondering whether someone was going to randomly going to laugh at me, draw attention to my biggest insecurity, embarrass me in front of others or just generally be cruel for no reason really fucked me up honestly in a lot of ways.\n\nIt's been years and I can't remember the last time anything like that happened.
