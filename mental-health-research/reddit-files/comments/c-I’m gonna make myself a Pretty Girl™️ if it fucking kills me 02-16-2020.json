The incel part pertains to the idea that if one is an incel, unlike more attractive people, one would be more likely to settle for a less attractive partner (yes, I am aware that physical attraction doesn't/shouldn't make the entire relationship, but it does enhance *certain* aspects of the relationship, so understand that \"settle\" is just used for lack of a better word). I'm also willing to bet that most incels wouldn't mind being treated \"like a ~~queen~~ king\" even if \"(they) know that they love (them) only for how great (they) look so the connection might fizzle out.\" The point being that if/when girls lose weight, they can get more attention, but for guys it tends to take more than just weight loss to become more attractive to/get attention from the opposite sex.",

The incel part pertains to the idea that if one is an incel, unlike more attractive people, one would be more likely to settle for a less attractive partner (yes, I am aware that physical attraction doesn't/shouldn't make the entire relationship, but it does enhance *certain* aspects of the relationship, so understand that \"settle\" is just used for lack of a better word). I'm also willing to bet that most incels wouldn't mind being treated \"like a ~~queen~~ king\" even if \"(they) know that they love (them) only for how great (they) look so the connection might fizzle out.\" The point being that if/when girls lose weight, they can get more attention, but for guys it tends to take more than just weight loss to become more attractive to/get attention from the opposite sex.",

The incel part pertains to the idea that if one is an incel, unlike more attractive people, one would be more likely to settle for a less attractive partner (yes, I am aware that physical attraction doesn't/shouldn't make the entire relationship, but it does enhance *certain* aspects of the relationship, so understand that \"settle\" is just used for lack of a better word). I'm also willing to bet that most incels wouldn't mind being treated \"like a ~~queen~~ king\" even if \"(they) know that they love (them) only for how great (they) look so the connection might fizzle out.\" The point being that if/when girls lose weight, they can get more attention, but for guys it tends to take more than just weight loss to become more attractive to/get attention from the opposite sex.",

The incel part pertains to the idea that if one is an incel, unlike more attractive people, one would be more likely to settle for a less attractive partner (yes, I am aware that physical attraction doesn't/shouldn't make the entire relationship, but it does enhance *certain* aspects of the relationship, so understand that \"settle\" is just used for lack of a better word). I'm also willing to bet that most incels wouldn't mind being treated \"like a ~~queen~~ king\" even if \"(they) know that they love (them) only for how great (they) look so the connection might fizzle out.\" The point being that if/when girls lose weight, they can get more attention, but for guys it tends to take more than just weight loss to become more attractive to/get attention from the opposite sex.",

The incel part pertains to the idea that if one is an incel, unlike more attractive people, one would be more likely to settle for a less attractive partner (yes, I am aware that physical attraction doesn't/shouldn't make the entire relationship, but it does enhance *certain* aspects of the relationship, so understand that \"settle\" is just used for lack of a better word). I'm also willing to bet that most incels wouldn't mind being treated \"like a ~~queen~~ king\" even if \"(they) know that they love (them) only for how great (they) look so the connection might fizzle out.\" The point being that if/when girls lose weight, they can get more attention, but for guys it tends to take more than just weight loss to become more attractive to/get attention from the opposite sex.",

Anyway I appreciated the way you phrased things in your post OP. \n\nWell described! when I notice ppl/interations like this I usually am simultaneously crushing on/attracted to/ am objectifying... the joys of my closeted sexuality BAHAH. anyway now I have the hots for the girl you described XD\n\n-------\n\nI'm a pretty thin tall and \"fashionable\". I do feel people looking at me and enjoying looking at me and talking to me... especially when I am wearing revealing clothes and/or heavy makeup.  I do feel like I get attention and privilege because of it, however I don't really get a lot of \"extra's\"... in general most people avoid approaching me (intimidated/not into my personality? I'm not sure)... I don't usually have anyone (except people I am on dates with) buy me drinks or approach me randomly (a pick-up) etc. etc. despite being out and about in a major city for ~10 years. \nI do feel like a have a bit of an edge in conversations. It's a bit of a buffer to know that if I didn't manage to be charming at least I might have managed to be pretty. \n\nbut I also feel a lot of weird dislike and jealousy/derision.... quite a bit of it.

Her looks won't last and then what?  With an eating disorder you won't even have friends because going out to eat is what people do to socialise and you won't be able to.  Your personality shines through with your words.  You'll still be more interesting when she loses her looks. Who knows, maybe she's not happy with herself in some way.  It's like when I see what I think is a perfect face yet the face owner goes and gets some cosmetic surgery.  I don't even know if anyone's happy with how they look.  Don't compare yourself to someone else, it really gets you nowhere and whatever you think, there's going to be something about you that somebody else envies. x",

The incel part pertains to the idea that if one is an incel, unlike more attractive people, one would be more likely to settle for a less attractive partner (yes, I am aware that physical attraction doesn't/shouldn't make the entire relationship, but it does enhance *certain* aspects of the relationship, so understand that \"settle\" is just used for lack of a better word). I'm also willing to bet that most incels wouldn't mind being treated \"like a ~~queen~~ king\" even if \"(they) know that they love (them) only for how great (they) look so the connection might fizzle out.\" The point being that if/when girls lose weight, they can get more attention, but for guys it tends to take more than just weight loss to become more attractive to/get attention from the opposite sex.",

If a woman isn't already decent looking without makeup, she can:\n\n- Get some nice makeup \n\nand will be easily much better looking. If she wasn't getting attention from the opposite sex before, she is now.\n\nOther things it tends to take, **for men**, if they aren't already good looking:\n\n- Do gym\n\n- Improve looks (haircut, acne, skin, etc.)\n\n- Improve social skills/personality\n\n- Become very rich\n\nUpon making these **changes for the long-term**, the guy is now also competing with similar other good looking guys.",
