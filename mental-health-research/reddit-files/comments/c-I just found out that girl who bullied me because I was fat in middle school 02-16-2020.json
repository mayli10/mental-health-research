It's gruelling work - you'll miss a lot of sleep and you'll spend the entire day going to casting after casting. Some guys are in the business to take advantage of girls and this is commonplace as well. Also doing photoshoots when you're cold, wet, tired and just want to go home. There's also the massive pressure to lose weight unhealthily and to maintain an extremely underweight BMI. It's super taxing on your mental health, and I doubt she's happy.",
