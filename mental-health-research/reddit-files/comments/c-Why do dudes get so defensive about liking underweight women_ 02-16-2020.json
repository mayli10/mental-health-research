Literally just guess the exorbitant amount of money companies pushing diet products, makeup, etc. make in a year.\n\nThe standard being an unhealthy body is KEY to the profitability of the diet (and pretty much the whole beauty) industry. Because it ensures that even if an overweight women were to slim down to a healthy weight, like a BMI 22,  which she could maintain sustainibly and naturally, she will NEVER match the bodies of the models in magazines and TV.\n\n Ads encourage women to demonize the natural features of a healthy body that are completely benign, like thighs that touch in some places or belly pooches, all the while claiming that \"just being healthy and exercising\" will give them a model's body, that models are just lucky; the result of a fast metabolism or good genetics or what have you. \"Buy our products and you can look like this too!\" - A disgusting, dirty lie, bc the real answer is *starve.*\n\nwhew /rant over. I hope this actually makes sense lol. Feels good to get it out.",

But he always said I was too big and needed to lose weight. Oh, but he just wanted me to be healthy of course! He was sooooo concerned about my health. At a healthy BMI, with a mostly healthy diet and plenty of exercise. I even dragged him to one of my doctor\u2019s appointments with me so he could hear a medical doctor say I was at a healthy weight. Made no difference. \n\nLike, dude, just admit the truth. You don\u2019t give a shit about my health. You have an aesthetic preference for underweight women. Your preference is for an unhealthy body type. Just in the opposite direction of the men who have a \u201cfat fetish\u201d. Just admit that it\u2019s not about my health and is about your personal preferences.

Straight guys act like their dicks are health experts. \"I'm a heterosexual male and I want to have sex with her, so she must be healthy.\" \n\nIt's the same evopsych bullshit all over Reddit and guys just don't want to admit that their preferences for women are just as influenced by societal beauty ideals as women's own ideals! I don't blame them, but just I wish they'd just admit it ffs. Maybe then we could have a meaningful discussion about why the extremely thin ideal is damaging to women. \n\nBut no, if you even dare to criticize it you get insulted and told you are probably fat (as if that would take away from my credibility??). I feel so strongly about this exactly *because* I have starved myself and become underweight and had the same BMI as these celebrities and therefore know how hard it is to force your body to stay that way, and that this doesn't come natural for most of the women who claim to be naturally underweight.",

Women also aren't the ones who fight about the steroids thing, in my experience? Mostly dudes battle over whether its natty or not lmao. And there's so much more variety in attractive male physiques compared to women. Like, if men don't only think that the underweight big tits lady is hot, he's literally given labels. Chubby chaser. Or he 'likes amazonians' or 'death by snu snu' and shit like that. Idk I'm tired and ranting. Sweet dreams lol",

If they could be completely honest, I feel like many men are attracted to underweight women because they look younger and so much weaker. I grew up with a lot of dude friends and wanting to be the macho caveman with a tiny, frail partner has NOT gone out of style.  \nBut they know that it would make them sound gross to admit that they want a partner who is small, frail, and young, so they hyperfixate on the idea that skinny = healthy because it's \"just natural to be attracted to health\" when, evolutionarily speaking, a good breeding partner would be one with plenty of muscle, a little bit of fat for food scarcity, and enough energy to bear children. Like if you are really going to try and argue the paleo approach, it's not \"natural/biologically wired\" to be more attracted to women who look like they wouldn't survive pregnancy.\n\nNot saying it's wrong. My inspo insta feed is full of them. But it's got zero to do with health.",
