Also, if you have serious vitamin deficiency, ask your doctor about perhaps upping the dose (most of these have a limit of 1 per day, but if you're very low on what they provide it might not be too bad to take more for a short time- again, ask a professional about it)\n\nGood luck!!

Also, if you have serious vitamin deficiency, ask your doctor about perhaps upping the dose (most of these have a limit of 1 per day, but if you're very low on what they provide it might not be too bad to take more for a short time- again, ask a professional about it)\n\nGood luck!!

Our MLS has already been working on new coming soon rules so it can be a status in our MLS, so this will fit perfectly. Now, the coming soon will work like it is supposed to, which is to build some anticipation and perhaps a very quick sale. Right now, it doesn't serve the client well due to lack of larger exposure to the market and is really just a ploy by the listing agent to get both sides of the transaction.

Also, if you have serious vitamin deficiency, ask your doctor about perhaps upping the dose (most of these have a limit of 1 per day, but if you're very low on what they provide it might not be too bad to take more for a short time- again, ask a professional about it)\n\nGood luck!!

Also, if you have serious vitamin deficiency, ask your doctor about perhaps upping the dose (most of these have a limit of 1 per day, but if you're very low on what they provide it might not be too bad to take more for a short time- again, ask a professional about it)\n\nGood luck!!

Also, if you have serious vitamin deficiency, ask your doctor about perhaps upping the dose (most of these have a limit of 1 per day, but if you're very low on what they provide it might not be too bad to take more for a short time- again, ask a professional about it)\n\nGood luck!!
