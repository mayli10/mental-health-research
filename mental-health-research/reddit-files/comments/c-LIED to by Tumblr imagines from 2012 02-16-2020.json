I\u2019m usually an in between size due to my bust but I usually size down 1-2 sizes from the size chart because my waist isn\u2019t large compared to my bust. I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain. Everyone\u2019s body shape is so different so size charts just really don\u2019t work amazingly.\n\nBra size charts piss me off the most tho.

I\u2019m usually an in between size due to my bust but I usually size down 1-2 sizes from the size chart because my waist isn\u2019t large compared to my bust. I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain. Everyone\u2019s body shape is so different so size charts just really don\u2019t work amazingly.\n\nBra size charts piss me off the most tho.

I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain.

I\u2019m usually an in between size due to my bust but I usually size down 1-2 sizes from the size chart because my waist isn\u2019t large compared to my bust. I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain. Everyone\u2019s body shape is so different so size charts just really don\u2019t work amazingly.\n\nBra size charts piss me off the most tho.

I\u2019m usually an in between size due to my bust but I usually size down 1-2 sizes from the size chart because my waist isn\u2019t large compared to my bust. I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain. Everyone\u2019s body shape is so different so size charts just really don\u2019t work amazingly.\n\nBra size charts piss me off the most tho.

I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain.

I\u2019m usually an in between size due to my bust but I usually size down 1-2 sizes from the size chart because my waist isn\u2019t large compared to my bust. I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain. Everyone\u2019s body shape is so different so size charts just really don\u2019t work amazingly.\n\nBra size charts piss me off the most tho.

I\u2019m usually an in between size due to my bust but I usually size down 1-2 sizes from the size chart because my waist isn\u2019t large compared to my bust. I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain. Everyone\u2019s body shape is so different so size charts just really don\u2019t work amazingly.\n\nBra size charts piss me off the most tho.

I can usually size down for a better fit, but that depends on the material and how I like things to fit. I hate anything that\u2019s too form fitting  (especially on the sleeves) but some materials simply do not allow for me to size down at all because there\u2019s no give in it for the bust or shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s a pain.
