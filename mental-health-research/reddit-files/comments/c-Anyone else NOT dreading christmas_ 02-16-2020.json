The guilt comes later. But on the day at least EVERYONE is eating to excess so for one shining moment I don\u2019t feel like a hopeless disgusting fatty I feel NORMAL and FULL\n\nLast year really messed me up though, I got stuck in a binge rut for weeks/months. This year I\u2019m gonna practice more mindful eating so that I don\u2019t fully \u201close control\u201d and spiral",

I\u2019ll feel guilty the next day but it\u2019s one day where I won\u2019t be judged for eating thousands of calories over what I should. \n\nI\u2019m too big for people to think my eating in excess is cute or whatever. \n\nI\u2019m worried about that too, but my mother is visiting in January so I want her to see I\u2019m not obese anymore so I can\u2019t spiral into binge eating for weeks at a time :/ we\u2019ll see \n\nGood luck for the holidays!",

Reminds me about the times I would allow myself to eat whatever with my family on Christmas Day and not feel guilty. In recent years I\u2019ve developed an insane fear of eating in front of people who are not my boyfriend though and I\u2019ve started bringing my own food to my mother\u2019s on Christmas as well (steamed veggies, some steamed rice). This year I\u2019ll probably still be on bed rest so maybe I won\u2019t have to think about it? Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to celebrate with everyone else around the table soon again, I mean it.",

I started restricting again and I was able to slowly get back to a deficit. \n\nI\u2019ve written about it before so if you go through my posts you\u2019ll find a longer thing but some tips:\n\n-\tDon\u2019t try and compensate for your binges; focus on getting back to \u201cnormal\u201d, not restricting. Set your goal to maintenance for now. Trying to restrict too fast will just lead to more binges when you go over your goal. \n-\tTrack everything, even if you\u2019re still binging. My binges were at their worst and longest when I stopped tracking because I\u2019d literally forget foods. \n-\tDon\u2019t fight it. Work with it. Don\u2019t deny that you want to binge; see if you can work on a compromise with yourself. \n\nBasically, just focus on getting control over your eating, not how much you eat. Prioritise making conscious decisions, even if you have to choose to overeat at first. \n\nGood luck, it\u2019s hard but completely doable.",

I started restricting again and I was able to slowly get back to a deficit. \n\nI\u2019ve written about it before so if you go through my posts you\u2019ll find a longer thing but some tips:\n\n-\tDon\u2019t try and compensate for your binges; focus on getting back to \u201cnormal\u201d, not restricting. Set your goal to maintenance for now. Trying to restrict too fast will just lead to more binges when you go over your goal. \n-\tTrack everything, even if you\u2019re still binging. My binges were at their worst and longest when I stopped tracking because I\u2019d literally forget foods. \n-\tDon\u2019t fight it. Work with it. Don\u2019t deny that you want to binge; see if you can work on a compromise with yourself. \n\nBasically, just focus on getting control over your eating, not how much you eat. Prioritise making conscious decisions, even if you have to choose to overeat at first. \n\nGood luck, it\u2019s hard but completely doable.",
