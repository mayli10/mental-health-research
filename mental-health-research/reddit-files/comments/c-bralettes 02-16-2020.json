People complimented me and it really helped me see that maybe I\u2019m not totally hideous. I still struggle with my boobs and my body image A LOT and think about getting my boobs done, but it\u2019s baby steps :) \n  \nSpeaking of which, I ordered some bras and undies from Rihanna\u2019s line and I can\u2019t wait to try them on later! \n\nupdate: I ordered two bras in the same size and one is too big and one is too small \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f also i read the reviews for underwear and got one in s and one in m because it supposedly ran super tiny and they look the same wtf lol??
