(ETA: at least they did this 6 yrs ago when I was there, don\u2019t know what drugs are commonly prescribed now.) Between Remeron, Seroquel, and Gabapentin they were making a killing off recovering addicts\u2019 insurance. I don\u2019t think I met a single person that wasn\u2019t on at least one of them. I stopped taking it as soon as I was out of rehab and had the authority to refuse meds at my halfway house, they didn\u2019t help and had side effects that were way worse than what they supposedly \u201chelped.\u201d",

I stopped taking it as soon as I was out of rehab and had the authority to refuse meds at my halfway house, they didn\u2019t help and had side effects that were way worse than what they supposedly \u201chelped.\u201d",

Even still, I was no where near how bad I was mentally when I got to a healthy weight. \n\nI gained probably 30 lbs in a short period of time after I got clean from heroin and even though I was still well within my \u201chealthy weight range\u201d and nowhere near over weight my ED thoughts were so bad that I thought I was basically a monster to those around me. And as I lost the weight, those thoughts got quieter again, though obviously they never were muted. \n\nWhen you\u2019ve had an ED ruled by weight loss for so long and then you gain weight I think there is something to be said about how even more skewed than \u201cnormal\u201d your perception can become. I think it can sometimes be even more detrimental to your mental health than your ED originally was because you have lost all semblance of self when you identify with your ED and lose that \u201cidentity.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m in recovery now and it\u2019s been several years so my ED thoughts are much much quieter now. I still have a ways to go and sometimes old habits die hard, especially in times of stress, but it\u2019s no longer a conscious decision and I try to correct the behavior. Which is why I no longer even own a scale, because the numbers consume me. But something I think about sometimes is if I would still be doing as well now if I wasn\u2019t still quite thin. And sadly, I think the answer would most likely be no, I wouldn\u2019t. Like I said, I still have a ways to go before I think I can get there, if I ever can.",

(ETA: at least they did this 6 yrs ago when I was there, don\u2019t know what drugs are commonly prescribed now.) Between Remeron, Seroquel, and Gabapentin they were making a killing off recovering addicts\u2019 insurance. I don\u2019t think I met a single person that wasn\u2019t on at least one of them. I stopped taking it as soon as I was out of rehab and had the authority to refuse meds at my halfway house, they didn\u2019t help and had side effects that were way worse than what they supposedly \u201chelped.\u201d",

I found out later that it can cause weight gain which wasn\u2019t helpful as a newly clean heroin addict struggling with an ED simultaneously. \n\nBut then again the whole \u201cRehab Industry\u201d in Florida is a fucking mess and they prescribed pretty much everyone a cocktail of the same 4-5 drugs that (surprise) don\u2019t work for everyone. (ETA: at least they did this 6 yrs ago when I was there, don\u2019t know what drugs are commonly prescribed now.) Between Remeron, Seroquel, and Gabapentin they were making a killing off recovering addicts\u2019 insurance. I don\u2019t think I met a single person that wasn\u2019t on at least one of them. I stopped taking it as soon as I was out of rehab and had the authority to refuse meds at my halfway house, they didn\u2019t help and had side effects that were way worse than what they supposedly \u201chelped.\u201d",

                "Text": "I hate it so much. It's the reason why I never got into treatment for an eating disorder. I am formally diagnosed with BED, but my health care provider at the time marked it down as \"not the focus of therapy\" because I wasn't in a dangerous area with my weight. I also lied about struggling with eating because I felt like they wouldn't believe me if I told them I was still going through cycles of binge eating, restricting and bingeing/purging ALL THE TIME.\n\nLast year my restricting/anorexic behaviours came back with full force. I lost a lot of weight in a pretty short period of time and everyone congratulated me because I'm overweight. Then I had a breakdown earlier this year and tried to stop, but now I'm back in the same hellscape. Your brain doesn't stop with this bullshit just because you are no longer underweight. Not eating enough, not getting the nutrients you need, is dangerous, even if you are overweight. What I'm doing to myself is a nightmare and I'm still not ready to get help because I feel like I don't \"deserve\" it and nobody will take me seriously because I'm not emaciated. To be honest, I really want to recover, but my brain keeps spinning that into \"Well, I guess we really need to buckle down and starve ourselves so we can be severely underweight and get the treatment we need\".",
