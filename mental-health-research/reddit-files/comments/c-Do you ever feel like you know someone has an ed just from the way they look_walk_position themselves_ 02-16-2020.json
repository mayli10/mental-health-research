Drank diet coke religiously, always a small lunch of soup or something else that was very low in caloric density, habitual smoker, extremely gaunt. I think we both kind of watched each other at work and *knew*. \n\nWe were outside for a smoke break and its frigid outside. In the area were designated to smoke at there was a dumpster that was just far away enough from the wall that a very thin person could slip through and hide. I jokingly said that I was just gonna slip back behind the dumpster and smoke to stay warm. She laughed and said, good thing your so thin! We chuckled together and had this odd moment of unspoken ED solidarity. \n\nNever saw her again after that day. I think about her sometimes.",
