If someone was cutting their arms or bloodletting etc, you\u2019d expect someone to care. Same thing. You wear your torment on your body, it worries people. Plus, your professors have a duty of care. Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re fulfilling that and articulating their concern and offering advice or if they\u2019re just making statements on how you look (I hope not the latter). I think in your situation I would just be honest; tell them yes, you are sick but you don\u2019t want help or you\u2019re getting help, whatever, just be direct about it and they\u2019ll quickly find out what they\u2019re role is or isn\u2019t.

You could also try denying it and do the \"thanks for your concern, I'm just naturally skinny\" or \"thanks for the concern, unfortunately there are lots of health issues that cause people to be thin\" or \"I find comments on my body inappropriate\".",

I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

She was experiencing tough times and despite already being small, she just stopped eating.  She experienced heart failure at home and no one discovered her for 4 or 5 days.  I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re fulfilling that and articulating their concern and offering advice or if they\u2019re just making statements on how you look (I hope not the latter). I think in your situation I would just be honest; tell them yes, you are sick but you don\u2019t want help or you\u2019re getting help, whatever, just be direct about it and they\u2019ll quickly find out what they\u2019re role is or isn\u2019t.

I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

She was experiencing tough times and despite already being small, she just stopped eating.  She experienced heart failure at home and no one discovered her for 4 or 5 days.  I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

It's important (again, for me at least) to realize I can't just passively let this rule my life and hope it'll pass. If I want to get better, I gotta try hard and kick its butt. Easier said that done of course :( as today was definitely not progress in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, I believe all of us have the chance to one day be in a much healthier place, and the support of this community is so lovely for all of us, no matter what stage we may be in.",

Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re fulfilling that and articulating their concern and offering advice or if they\u2019re just making statements on how you look (I hope not the latter). I think in your situation I would just be honest; tell them yes, you are sick but you don\u2019t want help or you\u2019re getting help, whatever, just be direct about it and they\u2019ll quickly find out what they\u2019re role is or isn\u2019t.

Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re fulfilling that and articulating their concern and offering advice or if they\u2019re just making statements on how you look (I hope not the latter). I think in your situation I would just be honest; tell them yes, you are sick but you don\u2019t want help or you\u2019re getting help, whatever, just be direct about it and they\u2019ll quickly find out what they\u2019re role is or isn\u2019t.

She was experiencing tough times and despite already being small, she just stopped eating.  She experienced heart failure at home and no one discovered her for 4 or 5 days.  I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re fulfilling that and articulating their concern and offering advice or if they\u2019re just making statements on how you look (I hope not the latter). I think in your situation I would just be honest; tell them yes, you are sick but you don\u2019t want help or you\u2019re getting help, whatever, just be direct about it and they\u2019ll quickly find out what they\u2019re role is or isn\u2019t.

She was experiencing tough times and despite already being small, she just stopped eating.  She experienced heart failure at home and no one discovered her for 4 or 5 days.  I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

If someone was cutting their arms or bloodletting etc, you\u2019d expect someone to care. Same thing. You wear your torment on your body, it worries people. Plus, your professors have a duty of care. Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re fulfilling that and articulating their concern and offering advice or if they\u2019re just making statements on how you look (I hope not the latter). I think in your situation I would just be honest; tell them yes, you are sick but you don\u2019t want help or you\u2019re getting help, whatever, just be direct about it and they\u2019ll quickly find out what they\u2019re role is or isn\u2019t.

I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

If someone was cutting their arms or bloodletting etc, you\u2019d expect someone to care. Same thing. You wear your torment on your body, it worries people. Plus, your professors have a duty of care. Don\u2019t know if they\u2019re fulfilling that and articulating their concern and offering advice or if they\u2019re just making statements on how you look (I hope not the latter). I think in your situation I would just be honest; tell them yes, you are sick but you don\u2019t want help or you\u2019re getting help, whatever, just be direct about it and they\u2019ll quickly find out what they\u2019re role is or isn\u2019t.

You're right, it's absolutely not their place and \"you look anorexic\" isn't an appropriate way to approach it, anyway. Does that sound doable (the \"not willing to talk about it?\"). You could also try denying it and do the \"thanks for your concern, I'm just naturally skinny\" or \"thanks for the concern, unfortunately there are lots of health issues that cause people to be thin\" or \"I find comments on my body inappropriate\".",

I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",

So be kind to yourself, be selfish and love yourself today and every day. Don\u2019t waste a minute or a tear on the thoughts that might stop you from seeking your place in the world. Accept and find help if you can from your Family, Friends and Peers. Never forget there is only one you and you are amazing. Completely uniquely irreplaceable. Let go of you self-reflective inward thinking and share your thoughts and share your life ED and all.\n\nTake it from someone with a few more years\u2019 of experience on both sides of the apprehensive, angst, tear filled, self-destructive and self-reflective line.  \n\nHope my sharing helped.

When you said when you get very depressed, you stop eating, I thought it might be the former. Neither is less or more, just different in approach to recovery. I wish I could offer some kind of inspiration but I can\u2019t. You have responsibilities, you know what\u2019s at stake. I\u2019m so terribly sorry that you\u2019re still struggling. It must break your heart. Are your children young enough that they haven\u2019t noticed yet? If it would be of help, I am happy to pass on what got me in to recovery (it\u2019s nothing magical).

She was experiencing tough times and despite already being small, she just stopped eating.  She experienced heart failure at home and no one discovered her for 4 or 5 days.  I have a spouse and kids so hopefully someone will be around to notice if something happened to me, but it\u2019s scary to think that I could face a similar fate if I fell into a severe depression (which is when I stop eating entirely as well.)\n\nThankfully you are on the right path and will have a lot more joy in your life by pursuing a career you love.",
