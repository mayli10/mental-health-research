                "Text": "It must be really frustrating that when you're already planning and looping around in your mind so much about your next-move for an eating decision, that someone else comes in and confuses the whole thing with even more options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOthers don't know what immense amounts of options and future paths ED suffers play through in their minds before deciding to eat something. It's chess with yourself, where you have to think through your own possible move, and then the consequences, and then the next ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTons of criteria -- sometimes explainable to others, sometimes not -- calories, safeness, time-of-eating, colour, craving, speed, texture, bloating, recovery-thoughts, financial cost, have to be accounted for. And every ED voice is different. And worse, sometimes these criteria change from situation to situation. So queen-doesn't-always-take-pawn. The rules of your own game just change sometimes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty impossible, even to another ED sufferer, to communicate how much mental and emotional energy that any particular ED-chess-game costs. Even if you happen to also be a ED-chess Grand Master.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, when someone else sits over your shoulder and looks at the chess board and starts spitballing possible moves so much that you can't think about or stick to your own, this is infuriating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven worse when this person is someone that for the beginning years of your life, when you were shitting yourself and and couldn't walk or make a sentence, was essentially a superhero genius. I mean, of course they're not. We know this. They're just a human being, who is also probably by now less tapped-in-to the other human beings in this world than you are. So you're more evolved. You're more exposed to other people playing their own mind-chess-games against themselves, and against others. Sometimes dumb school or work politics, sometimes an ED chess game, sometimes anxiety. You can understand and respect others mental-chess-game-moves more easily because you're more connected to the world. We know this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, no matter that *we know this*, somewhere in our baby mind, we think parents should know better than us. And maybe even know *us* better than us. Because that's the first thing in life you learn. Our very first memories are of them knowing *everything*, especially about our needs, with some magic psychic connection. They know, all without us being able to speak, or know ourselves, when we need to have our diaper changed, when we need to burp, when we need a nap, when we need to put on a little baby sweater, when we need a cuddle. And I am sure it's super frustrating that now that you *can* speak for yourself, *after* you have come to a conclusion about the best ED-chess-move to make, this once-omnipotent person is spitballing things that don't make sense. Frustrating that they do it in the first place, frustrating that they seem to think they know best about us, frustrating that they don't listen because \"Ma, I can actually speak what I need now !\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut as well as talk now, you can also choose. You have control over your food-moves. But that is a different topic. In this case, you have to choose to be gentle with her. Or it's just going to get confusing and frustrating for you that someone who once-knew-everything is telling you how to play your very fucking complicated ED-chess-game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if she knows about your ED. If not, you can't expect her to understand choosing noodles is *your choice* and wasn't necessarily an easy one. Even if she does know about your ED, however, this is going to make her even more overwhelmed and confused and panicky because she surely wants to care for you, but can't follow the rules of your current chess game. It's probably hard for you to even know what the best move is. How can she ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I think the best way to give yourself and her some peace is make her stop. Gently. *Soooooo* *gently*. By acknowledgement of what she is thinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Mom, you're offering me a lot of food options ! Hug ! You want to take care of me. I see that. You want to help me think through many choices. You want to show me ones I might not have known were there. You want me to be satisfied and happy. Thank you. Don't worry : I am happy and satisfied because I choose noodles. I know I can count on you to give me more food options if I need. Thank you.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVoil\u00e0. She feels heard and acknowledged. And she remembers that you have a voice now, too, and she doesn't have to read your screaming baby mind to find out what the fuck is wrong (sick ? hungry ? poop? hospital? cold? warm? doesn't like beards?). And then you can play your chess game in -- relative -- peace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's this one quite from DFW that I really like that reminds me of situations like these...\n\n\"How odd I can have all this inside me and to you it\u2019s just words.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you much strength and peace and courage.",
