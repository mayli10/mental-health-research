The foods they picked, the way they chewed, whether they were eating more or less than me or faster or slower. I could accurately tell you anyone's size just by looking at them. It was a constant calculation in my head of other people's weight, height, and clothing size. It was maddening and I couldn't stop.\n\nNowadays I can look at people and not obsessively think these things about them. I don't obsessively take my measurements or weigh myself either. I no longer take \"progress\" pictures and check the mirror every 20 minutes in fear that I've miraculously gained 50 pounds.\n\nMy life isn't fueled by fear and judgment anymore. Fat people don't bother me anymore, because it's not my life and it doesn't affect me, and all that judgment ever did was make me miserable. I'm not 100% better but I'm better, and if I could get better, even though I was so severely obsessed and messed up, you can too. x",

But then after working in a store with a grocery section, I understand that its because its what they can afford. Its like buy a pack of Oreos for 4 dollars which can last about a week depends on how many people eat them or spend 3 dollars on a head of broccoli which can last one or two meals. Like I said depends on how many are in a family. It's sad to be honest that you can afford all the junk food out there from grocery to fast food but pay 2 or 3 times more for a salad. But there are days when I will see a meal that is so disgusting to look at. Like a huge burger with two cheeses and bacon and ham and god knows what else. I want a burger not a heart attack.",

Anytime I go to the restroom I end up staring in the mirror at myself for long periods of time-- especially in the college bathrooms because the mirrors are so much larger.  I check my upper arms, thighs, stomach, everything.  If someone is in there with me I try to play cool and play it off but I fucking can't.  I have to stare myself down and belittle myself and look at skinner people just to trigger myself.\n\nWhat I hate even more is looking at people who are larger than me and thinking \"Oh, good, I am skinner\" because I INSTANTLY have to get onto myself.  I don't know their life.  They could have metabolism problems.  They could be poor and only afford food that isn't the healthiest.  Hell, I spend most of my time at my boyfriend's house and they have no fruits or any vegetables I can eat unless it is something for dinner.  Fruits just aren't there period.  They don't have money for it because it is too expensive.\n\nI don't enjoy judging everyone around me and I hate myself for it, so I seriously feel you :/",

The transition between healthy and in a relapse felt like jarring a crowbar into a big machine to get it to stop. My identity was tied up w/ being a hysterical weight loss phobic recovery-centred person and I loathed actively EDed people\n\nI had to reprogram myself and then I used the highs (drugs my brain produced) to turn it around.
