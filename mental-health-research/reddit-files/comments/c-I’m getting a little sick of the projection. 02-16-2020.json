I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to see other people with a few of our habits and slam them with a disorder title, acting as if we know them better than they know themselves. i never said they aren\u2019t contributing to an environment that could foster an ED in people with the potential to develop one. I just said we shouldn\u2019t be saying that they have one ourselves. I\u2019ve seen too many girls on YouTube or on twitter have to show pictures of their parents or them as a kid or otherwise explain why they are thin bc people keep harassing them and there are plenty of people that do a juice cleanse bc of Beyonc\u00e9 or whatever and then just go back to normal.\n\nI\u2019m glad u like my analogy and I like where u ran with it but u definitely misinterpreted a lot of what I was trying to say lmao.

Most people I know who're into fitness don't have EDs (afaik), but out of the people that come clean to me, every single one had that \"fitness stage\". Find me an alcoholic who went to college, and they drank too. Not every bug's an insect, but if you catch a bunch of bugs, you'll get a whole lot of insects. It's hardly \"projection\" to start suspecting that insects that act like bugs may be bugs.",

It's one thing to worry about someone, but it's a whole other thing to diagnose people from across a keyboard. That's just invasive even if the diagnosis is right, let alone if it's wrong.\n\nMost people online aren't even qualified to diagnose illnesses in the first place. God knows some doctors shouldn't be either, but at least they have access to more info about the full story.\n\nThanks for clarifying!

It sounds dumb, but I always thought that having a small frame would be an advantage, but then not understand why I looked so fat at the high end of a healthy weight when bigger boned friends looked slimmer at the same or even a higher weight. Of course, height is a factor too, and at 5'1 I really do feel I've lost the genetic lottery... it's like I only look good when my weight is at the low end of healthy. Otherwise I literally look a bit chubby even right in the middle of a healthy weight.\n\n\nEdit: a small frame other than my childbearing hips and big knees. What's especially disappointing is that my big hips can make people think I'm thicc... then I turn to the side and have no butt and it's like nvm, just cursed with somehow looking too fat and too skinny at the same time.",

I get that it comes from a place of experience where we would just starve ourselves for days and claim it was fasting, but starving and fasting are very different.\n\nThe average person engaging in discussion on a fasting-specific board or something will almost certainly know how to safely and appropriately do it - and that goes for any specialised diet. I just think it's a little harsh to throw the \"mentally ill\" label at people, especially when it's coming from a place of ignorance and in actuality they know far better about the subject.",

                "Text": "\"Crash diets aren't indicative of a problem\" uhh. Starving yourself for weeks, denying yourself any pleasure, and other such crash diet parameters are, in fact, a problem. Diet culture is a huge problem in the world today. \n\nI don't think dieting to lose weight is unhealthy, on the the contrary, losing weight for health is a great thing! But once you get into the self-loathing mindset and start pushing yourself too hard, which is very easy for dieters to spiral into, well, that's when it gets unhealthy. A lot of people who practice disordered eating start off as healthy dieters but fuck up their relationship with food, and start relying on the praise they got from weight loss, not realizing how far they slip until it's too late. And this isn't me projecting- the NEDA reports that about a quarter of all \"normal dieters\" develop an eating disorder. And in a culture that praises unhealthy thinness and there's whole diet sub-cultures of putting food into \"bad\" categories, you'd be surprised at the amount of  disordered eating habits that start becoming normalized- and even praised. Eating disorders are INCREDIBLY common, chances are you know quite a few people who struggle, just like you or me. \n\nSo if someone, especially someone very thin, is showing signs of disordered eating, people reaching out showing concern isn't a problem, it's being careful in this culture that villifies anyone who isn't thin.",

While not everyone will move from that to full blown eating disorder which he defines as a second stage where there is an intense fear of weight gain and fat, people can absolutely be on that precipice. I don't believe long term fasting (unless maybe for religious purposes??) is healthy. I know there are health benefits, but it can be a trigger that moves someone to disordered eating. Likewise, some of the posts on 1200isplenty are absolutely triggering and clearly represent some issues with food. \n\nWhile I agree we can't be armchair psychologists and diagnose others, diet culture normalizes unhealthy relationships with food. People can have disordered eating but label it a \"diet\". It's not. And it's important to call that shit out.",

Can I give a friendly reminder that even if they currently lack a raging eating disorder, for people who haven't been disordered for as long as they can remember, pre-disorder crash-dieting is almost a rule more than an exception?\n\nNot sure the most frequent problem with fitness culture is people assuming that diets *are* unhealthy. More like \"assuming that everyone is Just Fine as long as they don't say the d word, even if they brag about not eating for nearly a month, or overexercise to purge oops meals a-la lesser-known bulimia, or...\".\n\nI'm not saying everyone with dubious public habits has an ED, but man, everyone who goes \"wow, that seems disordered but ok\" isn't just \"\"\"\"projecting\"\"\"\".\n\nAnd it feels an awful lot like saying (or implying?) so is weaponizing peoples' disorders to override their viewpoints in a way that bypasses the real crux of whether their suspicions are actually well-founded.",

                "Text": "It\u2019s a spectrum and I think a lot of posta here seem to forget that; on one end is binge eating, in the middle is a normal diet, the other end restrictive eating disorders. Somewhere between normal eating and dieting exists dieting, crash dieting, etc. they are disordered behaviors but not inherently an eating disorder. Most people throughout their life, especially if they have a health crisis or attempt to find that healthy medium with eating, end up under-eating for a bit. It\u2019s a journey to find a dietary pattern that works for you. \n\nDiets are becoming more and more common, as are as campaigns trying to profit off of insecurity and being body conscious- id argue that having self esteem and body image issues are the norm now in society. \n\nWhen these things become pathologies is when they begin to risk somebody\u2019s health/wellbeing, impact their ability to function, or impact their ability to have normal stable reactions. So as online users we cannot alone determine if somebody underweight and dieting has an eating disorder, no more than we can determine if somebody who we see have a drink in a bar is a alcoholic. \n\nYes - sometimes it\u2019s most likely beyond a reasonable doubt somebody with an eating disorder in denial - I\u2019ve thought that about many girls I\u2019ve seen post online. But does that they (1) surely have an ED or (2) that it\u2019s my place to say something? No. Because it\u2019s none of my business unless they want to talk about it, and it\u2019s very easy to simply take a diet too far. \n\nI\u2019ve commented before about this, as every time a celebrity talks about having body image issues and dieting people here assume that it\u2019s an ED. Could it be? Yes. Is there a high probability l that it\u2019s an ED? Yes. Should we assume it\u2019s one because of that information alone? No. \n\nThere definitely is an element of projection, but I also think that being forced to be hyper aware of food, we also become hyper aware of others intakes, the things society suggests, and the ways in which dieting occurs. I think being sensitive is a more accurate description but merely my experience. :)",

Whoa, that's so far removed from reality. What a strange hypothetical situation.\n\nSure, fast-n-restrict crash dieting fitness isn't inherently a disorder, just like alcohol abuse isn't the same as alcoholism...but #1 is fertilizer for #2, marinating in the environment will help bolster symptoms as those symptoms are encouraged, and the audience overlaps by a mile.\n\nOne culture praises being able to never eat, or \"eat anything and never gain weight\", as long as nobody asks and nobody tells about how that skill was cultivated. The other praises being able to always drink, or drink a lot, as long as nobody asks and nobody tells about how that skill was cultivated.\n\nNot linking fitness culture with eating disorders, or college binge-drinking with alcoholism, is being more willfully blind than if we claimed they were synonymous.\n\nActually, this is a really good analogy, the more I think about it.

It's one thing to worry about someone, but it's a whole other thing to diagnose people from across a keyboard. That's just invasive even if the diagnosis is right, let alone if it's wrong.\n\nMost people online aren't even qualified to diagnose illnesses in the first place. God knows some doctors shouldn't be either, but at least they have access to more info about the full story.\n\nThanks for clarifying! And yeah, oops, I usually end up editing posts a lot and just kinda...hope the other person doesn't check their notifications too fast.",

It sounds dumb, but I always thought that having a small frame would be an advantage, but then not understand why I looked so fat at the high end of a healthy weight when bigger boned friends looked slimmer at the same or even a higher weight. Of course, height is a factor too, and at 5'1 I really do feel I've lost the genetic lottery... it's like I only look good when my weight is at the low end of healthy. Otherwise I literally look a bit chubby even right in the middle of a healthy weight.\n\n\nEdit: a small frame other than my childbearing hips and big knees. What's especially disappointing is that my big hips can make people think I'm thicc... then I turn to the side and have no butt and it's like nvm, just cursed with somehow looking too fat and too skinny at the same time.",

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to see other people with a few of our habits and slam them with a disorder title, acting as if we know them better than they know themselves. i never said they aren\u2019t contributing to an environment that could foster an ED in people with the potential to develop one. I just said we shouldn\u2019t be saying that they have one ourselves. I\u2019ve seen too many girls on YouTube or on twitter have to show pictures of their parents or them as a kid or otherwise explain why they are thin bc people keep harassing them and there are plenty of people that do a juice cleanse bc of Beyonc\u00e9 or whatever and then just go back to normal.\n\nI\u2019m glad u like my analogy and I like where u ran with it but u definitely misinterpreted a lot of what I was trying to say lmao.

Most people I know who're into fitness don't have EDs (afaik), but out of the people that come clean to me, every single one had that \"fitness stage\". Find me an alcoholic who went to college, and they drank too. Not every bug's an insect, but if you catch a bunch of bugs, you'll get a whole lot of insects. It's hardly \"projection\" to start suspecting that insects that act like bugs may be bugs.",

It's one thing to worry about someone, but it's a whole other thing to diagnose people from across a keyboard. That's just invasive even if the diagnosis is right, let alone if it's wrong.\n\nMost people online aren't even qualified to diagnose illnesses in the first place. God knows some doctors shouldn't be either, but at least they have access to more info about the full story.\n\nThanks for clarifying!

It sounds dumb, but I always thought that having a small frame would be an advantage, but then not understand why I looked so fat at the high end of a healthy weight when bigger boned friends looked slimmer at the same or even a higher weight. Of course, height is a factor too, and at 5'1 I really do feel I've lost the genetic lottery... it's like I only look good when my weight is at the low end of healthy. Otherwise I literally look a bit chubby even right in the middle of a healthy weight.\n\n\nEdit: a small frame other than my childbearing hips and big knees. What's especially disappointing is that my big hips can make people think I'm thicc... then I turn to the side and have no butt and it's like nvm, just cursed with somehow looking too fat and too skinny at the same time.",

The behavior isn\u2019t healthy and in some it could develop into a real problem but for the vast majority of people it remains an occasional unhealthy habit. In the case of American drinking culture, for many it remains a \u201cphase\u201d in college \n\nI like ur fertilizer analogy and agree but the topic at hand is diagnosing other people. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to see other people with a few of our habits and slam them with a disorder title, acting as if we know them better than they know themselves. i never said they aren\u2019t contributing to an environment that could foster an ED in people with the potential to develop one. I just said we shouldn\u2019t be saying that they have one ourselves. I\u2019ve seen too many girls on YouTube or on twitter have to show pictures of their parents or them as a kid or otherwise explain why they are thin bc people keep harassing them and there are plenty of people that do a juice cleanse bc of Beyonc\u00e9 or whatever and then just go back to normal.\n\nI\u2019m glad u like my analogy and I like where u ran with it but u definitely misinterpreted a lot of what I was trying to say lmao.

Most people I know who're into fitness don't have EDs (afaik), but out of the people that come clean to me, every single one had that \"fitness stage\". Find me an alcoholic who went to college, and they drank too. Not every bug's an insect, but if you catch a bunch of bugs, you'll get a whole lot of insects. It's hardly \"projection\" to start suspecting that insects that act like bugs may be bugs.",

It's one thing to worry about someone, but it's a whole other thing to diagnose people from across a keyboard. That's just invasive even if the diagnosis is right, let alone if it's wrong.\n\nMost people online aren't even qualified to diagnose illnesses in the first place. God knows some doctors shouldn't be either, but at least they have access to more info about the full story.\n\nThanks for clarifying!

It sounds dumb, but I always thought that having a small frame would be an advantage, but then not understand why I looked so fat at the high end of a healthy weight when bigger boned friends looked slimmer at the same or even a higher weight. Of course, height is a factor too, and at 5'1 I really do feel I've lost the genetic lottery... it's like I only look good when my weight is at the low end of healthy. Otherwise I literally look a bit chubby even right in the middle of a healthy weight.\n\n\nEdit: a small frame other than my childbearing hips and big knees. What's especially disappointing is that my big hips can make people think I'm thicc... then I turn to the side and have no butt and it's like nvm, just cursed with somehow looking too fat and too skinny at the same time.",
