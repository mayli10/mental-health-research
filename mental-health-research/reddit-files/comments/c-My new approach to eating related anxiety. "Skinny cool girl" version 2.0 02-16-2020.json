It is.. unconscious I think.. I don't know if it will work for me.. but well the other day I was able to wear a top showing my shoulders thinking of her attitude. I sometimes think of my friends attitude too. I have a lot of (what they call) a normal weight friends who simply don't care about what they wear. They like the feeling, so they wear the clothes. I would like to be confident about my image. Why are they confident? Maybe it's just a question of attitude. I'll keep playing this role",

The body is a vessel that she preens and looks after as she wishes but she is not limited to the body.",
