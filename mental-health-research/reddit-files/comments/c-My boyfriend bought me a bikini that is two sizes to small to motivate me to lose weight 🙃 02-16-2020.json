I need you to remove yourself and your feelings for your relationship and disassociate for a few minutes. \n\nForget this ever happened to you and imagine that you\u2019re reading this post from someone else on this sub, or maybe someone you love and care for. What advice would you give this person? Would you think that this sounds like a loving and healthy relationship? Does it sound like something you\u2019d want for your friend to suffer through? Imagine the future for this girl if she doesn\u2019t make a change ASAP.\n\nHere, I\u2019ll help... \n\nclose your eyes, take a breath, clear your head, and read my post to you below. \n\n hey Pasta-la-vista-bby! Love you\u2019re username! I\u2019m having a hard time right now and I really hope that you could help me with something. \nEven though my boyfriend knows that I\u2019ve struggled with an eating disorder, he decided that it would be ok for him to do something (FOR MY BIRTHDAY) that would really hurt me, make me feel ashamed of myself, and humiliate me. He bought me a bikini that was knowingly**way** too small and then asked me to try it on and take pictures of myself. Those pictures on my phone **make me want to die**. He knows that I\u2019ve been having a really hard time lately, so why would he do that to me? Why would he buy me a bikini **in December** in the first place? What message was he trying to send to me? Did he even think about that? If so, why would he put something so superficial like the size of my body above my own physical and emotional health? He knew that this wouldn\u2019t make me feel good, so how could he do that to me? **WHY** would he do that to me? And who the fuck needs a bikini in December\u203d\u203d\u203d \n\nI love my boyfriend, but he intentionally did something hurtful for his own gain without any regard for my feelings or my health. If he truly loved me, why wouldn\u2019t he have done something that made me feel loved? Why does he care more about the way I look than how healthy I am? Don\u2019t I deserve more than this? \n\nWhat should I do?",
