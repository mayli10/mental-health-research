In pictures from Christmas I look anywhere from average to heifer. So I can't even use photos as a reference when my dysmorphia is bad like fuck me lol\n\n",

I had a girl at college tell me I am tiny (I am 156 pounds and 5'1\") but I know I am not.  An AVERAGE weight for me should be, at the highest, around 130.  I was shocked when she said that because I know I am overweight; I barely eat, too (anywhere between not eating for days to 500ish calories if I do not binge).  I am losing weight very quickly but...how am I tiny?  Tiny would be so, so much less than I am...like 90 pounds...I feel so fat even if people say I am tiny because I know I am overweight...then I feel like she just told me I am tiny to make me feel better but it just triggered me even more",

I used to feel attractive at a healthy weight and did a bunch of nude modeling/men\u2019s magazine lingerie type work... now I look back at my old photos that I was once so incredibly proud of and I\u2019m horrified at how huge I look (and also horrified that anyone can Google me and see my body like that). My BDD has gotten so bad that I haven\u2019t left my house THIS YEAR even though I\u2019m almost at my LW. I don\u2019t know what I look like. Some mirrors make me look thin; others make me look wide. I don\u2019t trust other people to tell me the truth; I sure as fuck don\u2019t trust myself. Ugh.",
