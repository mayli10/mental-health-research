They ain't going anywhere. But when you lose fat, the fat empties out of the cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the fat feel squishier than usual. Then after a while you lose the water in those cells and they shrink. Thus your fat stores shrink, but you aren't losing the cells themselves. Which is fine. That is how our bodies work. So we can store fat when needed.  But also use it for energy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit to add: So since I know this, I know when my fat gets smooshy, to keep going because shit is working and I've lost some actual fat.

                            "Text": "I don't think we can link outside atricles, but go to the popular science site and search \"When you lose weight, your fat cells don't just let go of fat\"\n\nBasically, you have fat cells all the time. They ain't going anywhere. But when you lose fat, the fat empties out of the cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the fat feel squishier than usual. Then after a while you lose the water in those cells and they shrink. Thus your fat stores shrink, but you aren't losing the cells themselves. Which is fine. That is how our bodies work. So we can store fat when needed.  But also use it for energy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit to add: So since I know this, I know when my fat gets smooshy, to keep going because shit is working and I've lost some actual fat.

They ain't going anywhere. But when you lose fat, the fat empties out of the cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the fat feel squishier than usual. Then after a while you lose the water in those cells and they shrink. Thus your fat stores shrink, but you aren't losing the cells themselves. Which is fine. That is how our bodies work. So we can store fat when needed.  But also use it for energy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit to add: So since I know this, I know when my fat gets smooshy, to keep going because shit is working and I've lost some actual fat.

They ain't going anywhere. But when you lose fat, the fat empties out of the cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the fat feel squishier than usual. Then after a while you lose the water in those cells and they shrink. Thus your fat stores shrink, but you aren't losing the cells themselves. Which is fine. That is how our bodies work. So we can store fat when needed.  But also use it for energy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit to add: So since I know this, I know when my fat gets smooshy, to keep going because shit is working and I've lost some actual fat.

They ain't going anywhere. But when you lose fat, the fat empties out of the cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the fat feel squishier than usual. Then after a while you lose the water in those cells and they shrink. Thus your fat stores shrink, but you aren't losing the cells themselves. Which is fine. That is how our bodies work. So we can store fat when needed.  But also use it for energy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit to add: So since I know this, I know when my fat gets smooshy, to keep going because shit is working and I've lost some actual fat.

They ain't going anywhere. But when you lose fat, the fat empties out of the cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the fat feel squishier than usual. Then after a while you lose the water in those cells and they shrink. Thus your fat stores shrink, but you aren't losing the cells themselves. Which is fine. That is how our bodies work. So we can store fat when needed.  But also use it for energy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit to add: So since I know this, I know when my fat gets smooshy, to keep going because shit is working and I've lost some actual fat.

They ain't going anywhere. But when you lose fat, the fat empties out of the cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the fat feel squishier than usual. Then after a while you lose the water in those cells and they shrink. Thus your fat stores shrink, but you aren't losing the cells themselves. Which is fine. That is how our bodies work. So we can store fat when needed.  But also use it for energy.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit to add: So since I know this, I know when my fat gets smooshy, to keep going because shit is working and I've lost some actual fat.
