I got tired of eating all the time, tired of feeling ugly (I was very ugly). I never thought I'd feel hot, ever. This goes for more than developing an ED, but its possible to get there, not just through starving, but in a healthy way too. Dont give up, guys. After a lifetime of ridicule, it feels just absolutely amazing to be considered conventionally attractive. Literally all of us are capable of changing. \n\nI had no idea what I was missing either, but look, we made it!",

                "Text": "Yup. I was always the chubby girl growing up. Puberty made it even worse. Being 80lbs at age 12, and then 130lbs at age 13? \n\nBy the time I was 14 I was at 150, maxing out at 155. I always remember having a stomach. I would sneak spoonfuls of peanut butter at night, or make myself baked potatoes loaded with mayo and butter. I remember just eating because I was hungry and not thinking about calories. My mom was always on me about my weight so it shamed me into eating less. She would never keep sweets around, so the little sweet stuff that was around, I\u2019d binge. \n\nBy the time I was 17, I managed to be 125lbs and 5\u20194. This was me being left to eat to my own devices. I was active too, walking everywhere. Then I got my first boyfriend, and suddenly all the restricted foods like pop, McDonald\u2019s, cookies and chocolate were just at my fingertips. I went ham. Shot up to 175lbs but I had some sort of body dysmorphia where I didn\u2019t see the weight gain. My size 4 jeans not fitting anymore? Whatever; just buy a bigger size! Back then I didn\u2019t care about weight gain!\n\nBroke up with the guy about a year later. Still overweight, but still got attention from guys so I didn\u2019t see a problem. But I remember seeing a photo of me at the amusement park. Wow. I was actually fat and I saw it. So I started losing weight the natural way, just eat less and exercise more. I lost about 10lbs in a month and people noticed. They were happy for me. \n\nThe moment my ED clicked in me was being made fun of, publicly for finally realizing how fat I was. Having your crush go upto you and pinch your arm fat in a huge group of guys? And congratulate you for \u201cfinally losing some god damn weight\u201d ? Fuck I cried for ages. I felt like I was humiliating myself by being fat. And I vowed to never be considered fat by anyone ever again. \n\nThat\u2019s how my first round of ED, I lost 50lbs in 3 months. Had a relapse where work stressed me out too much so I lost another 20lbs. And now I\u2019m at the weight where I\u2019m at now. Losing weight made me feel amazing. I felt powerful when I was able to fast for 4 days at a time and only eat on weekends. I was the \u201cskinny girl who ate real food\u201d stereotypes on the weekends.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m underweight, still see the fat girl and chasing that dragon. People honestly treat me better now that I\u2019m skinny. People actually want to hang out with me and be my friend. They care about my feelings. I never want to let go",
