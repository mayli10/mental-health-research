I take lax mainly as a form of self punishment, and a bit for quick water weight loss/to empty my bowels because if my stomach can't be empty, SOMETHING has to be. I use a lax tea mainly.

I lack self-compassion / I feel I cannot stop / I don't know what to do instead / etc.\" \n\nI hope we support each other enough to fill in the missing pieces after providing awareness",
