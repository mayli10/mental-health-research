She needed to learn her lesson somehow, so I think she deserved it in this case. Like, she literally went into your bedroom to steal the only food you can eat instead of just taking stuff from the kitchen. That's pretty low and she has no excuse for it.",

I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

I had laxatives in my bedroom (which she had to pop the lock to get in by the way), marked not to be eaten, after asking her not to eat anything in my bedroom. She poisoned herself by being a selfish pig.\n\n\nYou are being intellectually dishonest. You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                        "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

                        "Text": "A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ON FOOD WASN'T A WAKE UP CALL ALREADY!? You can feed a whole family for a month with under a quarter that amount! How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured.

She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured.

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured.

It's a soluble fiber called inulin, and like Metamucil, can kinda go either way on your GI tract, but something's going to happen.  LOL i have some at home that I add to baked goods since I cut the carbs.\n\nAnyway, I stopped looking, but I bet other products have sugar alcohols like maltitol or sorbitol, which also stmulate the gut.

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

Also depending on the culture eating a like that is not rare. I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants. We can't do more when the person doesn't want to be help, I guess we understand that feeling right?",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

                        "Text": ">I didn\u2019t dose her food. I had laxatives in my bedroom (which she had to pop the lock to get in by the way), marked not to be eaten, after asking her not to eat anything in my bedroom. She poisoned herself by being a selfish pig.\n\n\nYou are being intellectually dishonest. You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured. Civil court, though? Barriers of entry and burden of proof are lower. If OP is located in the US, hospital visits are very, very expensive and would easily outstrip the cost of stolen food.",

It's a soluble fiber called inulin, and like Metamucil, can kinda go either way on your GI tract, but something's going to happen.  LOL i have some at home that I add to baked goods since I cut the carbs.\n\nAnyway, I stopped looking, but I bet other products have sugar alcohols like maltitol or sorbitol, which also stmulate the gut.

I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured. Civil court, though? Barriers of entry and burden of proof are lower. If OP is located in the US, hospital visits are very, very expensive and would easily outstrip the cost of stolen food.",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

She views me as this spoiled little princess (despite the fact that she\u2019s WAY more spoiled than I am, and I\u2019ve worked so much harder in life than she ever has) because my family is well off and hers is dirt poor. She baby trapped my brother because she wanted to marry into our wealthy family and continued to crank out kids to ensure her position, and it worked, but she very overtly doesn\u2019t like being a mother. I\u2019m child free and it drives her crazy that I have that option when she thinks she had no other option to get and stay in a wealthy family other than having kids.  \n\nShe\u2019s also very resentful of the fact that I graduated college and she flunked out her first semester. She blames it on being a mom, but she had a full time live in nanny and a ton of help from family.\n\nMore recent, and food related, resentment has stemmed from a shift in our \u201cranking\u201d(I hate to say it like that) as women. She was the hot skinny little cheerleader in high school and I was a chubby little kid. Then I was a boney anorexic teenager, and then an obese college student (my first experience with in patient was awful, and caused me develop BED). She was very happy and comfortable always knowing she was the \u201chot one\u201d in our family (we are the only two non-menopausal women). She bragged about it and liked to rub it in my face. Recently, I\u2019ve lost a lot of weight, gotten healthier, put on muscle, and the baby face that made me so awkward looking as a teen makes me look very young for my mid-twenties. She has gained a ton of weight, looks 15 years older than she is, has no muscle mass, and is losing her hair. It KILLS her that on family outings men now approach and talk to me and she\u2019s the invisible one. \n\nShe just generally hates me, and has since I was in elementary school and she was a teenager. It\u2019s ridiculous that she\u2019s held that resentment for so long, and I can\u2019t believe I never lashed back at her before now. ",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

It's a soluble fiber called inulin, and like Metamucil, can kinda go either way on your GI tract, but something's going to happen.  LOL i have some at home that I add to baked goods since I cut the carbs.\n\nAnyway, I stopped looking, but I bet other products have sugar alcohols like maltitol or sorbitol, which also stmulate the gut.

Also depending on the culture eating a like that is not rare. I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants. We can't do more when the person doesn't want to be help, I guess we understand that feeling right?",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

I had laxatives in my bedroom (which she had to pop the lock to get in by the way), marked not to be eaten, after asking her not to eat anything in my bedroom. She poisoned herself by being a selfish pig.\n\n\nYou are being intellectually dishonest. You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons.

She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

LOL i have some at home that I add to baked goods since I cut the carbs.\n\nAnyway, I stopped looking, but I bet other products have sugar alcohols like maltitol or sorbitol, which also stmulate the gut.

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

In the US it's clear. Booby trapping/poisoning food is illegal. Laxatives have killed people. They can cause severe dehydration and internal organ damage. This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured. Civil court, though? Barriers of entry and burden of proof are lower. If OP is located in the US, hospital visits are very, very expensive and would easily outstrip the cost of stolen food.",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

It's a soluble fiber called inulin, and like Metamucil, can kinda go either way on your GI tract, but something's going to happen.  LOL i have some at home that I add to baked goods since I cut the carbs.\n\nAnyway, I stopped looking, but I bet other products have sugar alcohols like maltitol or sorbitol, which also stmulate the gut.

Also depending on the culture eating a like that is not rare. I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants. We can't do more when the person doesn't want to be help, I guess we understand that feeling right?",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

I had laxatives in my bedroom (which she had to pop the lock to get in by the way), marked not to be eaten, after asking her not to eat anything in my bedroom. She poisoned herself by being a selfish pig.\n\n\nYou are being intellectually dishonest. You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

It's a soluble fiber called inulin, and like Metamucil, can kinda go either way on your GI tract, but something's going to happen.  LOL i have some at home that I add to baked goods since I cut the carbs.\n\nAnyway, I stopped looking, but I bet other products have sugar alcohols like maltitol or sorbitol, which also stmulate the gut.

I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons.

She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured. Civil court, though? Barriers of entry and burden of proof are lower. If OP is located in the US, hospital visits are very, very expensive and would easily outstrip the cost of stolen food.",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

LOL i have some at home that I add to baked goods since I cut the carbs.\n\nAnyway, I stopped looking, but I bet other products have sugar alcohols like maltitol or sorbitol, which also stmulate the gut.

I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

                        "Text": "A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH ON FOOD WASN'T A WAKE UP CALL ALREADY!? You can feed a whole family for a month with under a quarter that amount! How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

In the US it's clear. Booby trapping/poisoning food is illegal. Laxatives have killed people. They can cause severe dehydration and internal organ damage. This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured. Civil court, though? Barriers of entry and burden of proof are lower. If OP is located in the US, hospital visits are very, very expensive and would easily outstrip the cost of stolen food.",

She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured. Civil court, though? Barriers of entry and burden of proof are lower. If OP is located in the US, hospital visits are very, very expensive and would easily outstrip the cost of stolen food.",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe.

She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions?

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons.

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

Also depending on the culture eating a like that is not rare. I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants. We can't do more when the person doesn't want to be help, I guess we understand that feeling right?",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured.

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

                            "Text": "Yikes, must\u2019ve been removed by a mod then \n\nThis is what I said: \nFor all those worried about my SIL, she\u2019s physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

Also depending on the culture eating a like that is not rare. I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants. We can't do more when the person doesn't want to be help, I guess we understand that feeling right?",

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

I had laxatives in my bedroom (which she had to pop the lock to get in by the way), marked not to be eaten, after asking her not to eat anything in my bedroom. She poisoned herself by being a selfish pig.\n\n\nYou are being intellectually dishonest. You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize. (I'm not saying that it is ed related but from what you describe it seems some sort of emotional/impulse regulations are off) Instead you used it against her.\n\n>laxative chocolate (I\u2019m not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily\u2019s and bakery items.\n\nThis- you **knew** she would ignore the warning signs. You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

                            "Text": "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but also my relationship with her is much more complicated than I was able to convey via writing. For many years she was extremely abusive towards me and has continued to carry on a pattern of disrespect towards me even now but we\u2019re both adults. Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

You put chocolate lax which is a medication in a plastic baggie and mixed it with regular food to camouflage it.\n\nYou bought a safe. Why did it not end there? You set her up maliciously and intentionally. It sounds like your SIL does need help, and as someone with their own mental illness one would think you could empathize.

You reasonably could deduct she would assume they were the other chocolate. Not to mention, you say it was labeled but you took it out of its medical packaging, so was it still labeled as a laxative with dose instructions? Or did it appear to be a chocolate bar in a baggie? \n\n>I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn\u2019t be too conspicuous of a trap.\n\nYou had the power to end the issue by buying a safe, but you escalated the situation because you think your SIL is a \u201cpig\u201d",

She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\nTo those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I\u2019ve asked her to not eat my food I\u2019m pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother\u2019s support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. \n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

I thing you were super nice and brave to try to help her, and I am sorry you had such a response, every-time I tried to approach my brother he would react violently, both verbal and physically. However when he needs me I am here and he reaches to me maybe once a year, on his terms, so that is as far as I can do, just be here for when he wants.

I also binge eat, so considered maybe that's the issues with SIL, but my broke teenage self would go out of my way to buy as much binge food as I could (cheap dollar store bulk cookies and snacks) just so I wouldn't eat everything in the house. I often made myself sick when I binged food at home, because I would have a little bit of everything instead of eating all of one thing. I tried really hard not to eat too much not only so I wouldn't get caught, but because I thought it was selfish of me. \n\nWhat makes me agree more is how its only OPs food, like that's just targetting bullshit. Then the lying through her teeth afterwards...reading this made me think \"is she having mental health issues or is she just manipulative and selfish?\"\n\nI feel like OP can't be blamed without everyone acknowledging that the SIL eats all her food and lies about it, so hopefully they all wise up and start holding her responsible for all the time and money OP has to spend because of her.",

Food is not the only thing she has stolen from me, my parents, or our other siblings. Nor is theft the only offense she has made. This woman has sabotaged my medication because she was \u201c just wanted to see if I really needed it\u201d. She\u2019s been allowed to get away with years of truly horrible behavior with no consequences because she\u2019s always been either pregnant or a new mom. Her food addiction has been a relatively new development, and at first I did sympathize with her a lot, I approached her waving the white flag, and offering support in anyway she needed it. She responded to this by laughing in my face, telling me I was imagining things, saying that she would always be prettier than me and that I\u2019d be a fat cow in my coffin even if I starved to death, telling me my boyfriend was only with me for the family money, and then accusing me to my family of injuring one of her kids and suggesting I be disinherited. The idea to plant laxatives in food I knew she\u2019d eat was born out of years of her being an absolute terror to me with no consequences because of her motherhood status (she was a teenage mom, essentially baby trapped my brother). \n\nIn any case, whether or not you take issue with my actions, they have lead to a good outcome I think. \n\nShe is physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She\u2019ll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. \n\n\nI had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  \u201cdon\u2019t tell me if I\u2019m right, because I don\u2019t want to know, but I just want you to know I\u2019m on your side here and I\u2019m not mad\u201d). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she\u2019s been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can\u2019t keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She\u2019s also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. \n\nMy brother has decided that he\u2019s going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he\u2019s going to seek a separation until she does. She\u2019s deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can\u2019t comprehend the that she\u2019s now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she\u2019s a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. \n\nI hope she\u2019ll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she\u2019s too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently. \n",

How could he ever let her get so out of control? That's absolutely ridiculous! Like if I were in his shoes I would be super worried about my wife. Not even because of the weight gain. Just because of how unhealthy that kind of behaviour is. Like, I'm completely certain that she must have extremely high sodium at a minimum. I would doubt that she's overdoing it in at least 6 other nutrients as well. And then there's also the financial damage her behaviour caused. That money could have been saved for the future or invested in their kids, but instead they spent it on letting her eat way more than any human needs. It was upsetting here about her behaviour before, but now I don't even know how to feel. She definitely has a problem, but at the same time no responsible parent should have ever let a personal problem like that get to such an extent. I seriously hope she gets better, if not for her own health at least to set a better example for her kids. Hopefully they're young enough that they don't learn anything from her before she starts getting better.",

                            "Text": "Yeah, I was blown away as well! Thats enough to feed me and my boyfriend for months! \n\nA little context: My family is quite well off, and my brother makes a lot of money on top of that. SIL has been completely spoiled ever since she stopped taking her birth control at 16 and got knocked up with my brothers kid (I\u2019m 200% sure she did it on purpose in order to baby trap him, she\u2019s all but admitted it). She\u2019s always spent a lot of money, my brother gives her a significant \u201callowance\u201d. Recently she\u2019s stopped spending that allowance on things the family needs, and has spent it almost exclusively on junk food and take out. \n\nTheir oldest kid is 19 and in college (she despises her mother almost as much as I do, she and I are only 7 years apart in age so we\u2019re close and we commiserate on how awful her mom is all the time. She was delighted when I told her what happened last night.) She\u2019s got two more teenagers, and 3 kids under the age 10. My brother only wanted 2 kids, but she kept \u201cforgetting\u201d take her birth control, I think because she was afraid my brother would leave her or she would at least lose her \u201cmother of a baby\u201d immunity status in the family. She doesn\u2019t mother her children very well and never has. She dumps them with my parents or one of my other siblings every weekend, and they have a nanny every single work day, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t work. With her last kid, 5 years ago, there was some issue and she\u2019s infertile now, her youngest being 5 has made her a little less immune to familial criticisms of her behavior and she\u2019s been FREAKING OUT over it. I personally think that\u2019s part of where the eating disorder came from. I felt a bit of sympathy for her when I noticed her massive weight gain and binging but she\u2019s still so vile, I can\u2019t sustain that empathy for long. ",

In the US it's clear. Booby trapping/poisoning food is illegal. Laxatives have killed people. They can cause severe dehydration and internal organ damage. This post makes it OP's intent to harm her SIL clear. Putting a note not to eat the poisoned food makes no difference -- if anything, makes it worse, because it shows OP assumed SIL would likely steal her food. \n\nI'm not condoning food theft, but OP solved the issue by getting a food safe. If she really wanted to harm her SIL, she could have done it in a way that would not cause her material bodily harm -- like baking a cake with salt instead of sugar, or a glitterbomb, or public shaming, or billing her for the cost of all the stolen food.",

Whereas one could reasonably assume that chocolate laxatives are normal chocolates, especially when they are hidden with regular, non-poisoned food.\n\nIf OP wanted to press the issue of theft, she could've notified the police. Instead she took matters into her own hands by poisoning her SIL, which is highly discouraged for by our justice system obvious reasons. Potential death > loss of a few hundred dollars. \n\nRegardless, it's highly unlikely a situation like this would escalate to criminal court anyway, unless someone actually died or was very seriously injured. Civil court, though? Barriers of entry and burden of proof are lower. If OP is located in the US, hospital visits are very, very expensive and would easily outstrip the cost of stolen food.",
