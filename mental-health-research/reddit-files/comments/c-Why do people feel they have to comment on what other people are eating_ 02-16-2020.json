I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness.

Then you have to spend like 5 minutes talking about your food, and hearing what they're all having for lunch and all you want to do is just eat and relax on your break instead of dealing with the freaking culinary inquisition. \n\nI eat pretty normal food (just in tiny portions) so people commenting on my food doesn't bother me but HOLY SHIT is this annoying on your lunch break at work.

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness.

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

                    "Text": "In a LOT of instances frozen food is actually *better* than \"fresh\". The frozen stuff goes right from picked in the field to begin frozen, which is kind of a state of suspended animation for the nutrients. The fresh stuff is picked, then stored, then put on trucks and shipped, then sits at the store. The entire time, it's breaking down and losing vitamins. I'm on mobile and can't figure out how to post a link, but a quick Google of \"fresh or frozen vegetables\" will give you the details. Also, fun fact: you get more lycopene from canned/cooked tomatoes than fresh. ",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness.

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness. That's a bully, and they deserve to be called out for their behavior.",

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness.

The minute someone thinks it is acceptable to start spouting off unsolicited advice or commentary about food/weight is the minute they've given you permission to do the same.

I assume this wasn't your intention, but I think it's pretty fair to say no one really likes feeling as though someone else is watching and judging what they eat. Would *you* like someone chiming in on your food choices every time you sat down to lunch?\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally there are only two reasons someone does this in the first place. Either they're just accidentally self-absorbed and never considered the other person's perspective or they're actively bullying someone (bullying meaning deriving self-worth through the condescending derision of others). Their response will tell you which one it was (\"Oh gosh I'm so sorry! I didn't think about it that way!\" = accidental rudeness -vs- \"Geeze I was just trying to help. No need to make such a big deal out of it.\" = overgrown child who can only feel like they're important/relevant if it's at the expense of someone else).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo one who actually is trying to be nice responds to someone else's discomfort, *that they caused*, by doubling down on their shittiness.

I pretty much always bring the same thing to school everyday: cruskits with vegemite and cheese, an apple and either some canned tuna or peas and corn and for some reason one of my friends in particular always have the need to comment on it. Things like \"cruskits and an apple for lunch again? Just like usual\" and \"do you ever bring anything else to school?\" Like wtf just leave me alone. \n\nAlso may i add the main culprit of this is one of my friends that is aware of my problems with eating (not sure if she knows i have an actual ED or not)\n\nThey also like to tell me how slow i eat and how i take little bites. This was something i used to do intentionally but i've been doing it for so long now that it's becoming natural to eat like that and they always comment on it.",
