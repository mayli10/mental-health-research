                        "Text": "holy crap you're right (in my case). I was restricting so much and was on a weight loss roll. But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

I'm much more in control now of both my drinking and avoiding triggers.  \n\n\nBut I don't think this longing to go back to that size will ever go away, it's just a matter of making peace with that fact while not giving in.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

I'm much more in control now of both my drinking and avoiding triggers.  \n\n\nBut I don't think this longing to go back to that size will ever go away, it's just a matter of making peace with that fact while not giving in.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

                "Text": "I think everyone kind of breaks eventually. You see people who are in recovery demonstrating a bit of a lack of control OTT eating under the guise of recovery and freedom from restriction sometimes - you know like on YouTube, where they are eating like billions of calories of junk? (I always think - you're going to gain at a rate you can't cope with and return to vilifying types of food as 'bad' because you've gained on junk only).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think of people who start weight training with no prior gym experience and their rate of progression being super fast. Then someone who has trained for YEARS having a slower progress because it's harder to shock the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith long term restriction the long term stress on the brain and the body does lead to cracks. Often the environment also changes and doesn't support restriction as well (i.e. living with others who have trigger foods that tempt binges, or having a partner). Or being less busy, and having more time that you need to distract yourself between your low calorie meals. A sense of failure and anguish at an inability to restrict always leads to more fails...or the gap between binges becomes much much shorter.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

                        "Text": "holy crap you're right (in my case). I was restricting so much and was on a weight loss roll. But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",

It's just that I cannot lose weight on a well balanced diet with a TINY, but consistent, caloric deficit because I can't even do that without binging screwing it all up.",

But, I got into a wonderful relationship and my eating habits seemed to turn healthy. Gradually gained a couple of pounds over the next year but I wasn't too worried because I still looked fine. However, me realizing that I cannot restrict like the way I used to (many many unsuccessful attempts to lose weight) + other school/job stresses = a whole new world of depression I've never felt before. Consequently, that depression and that feeling of absolutely NO self control probably caused me to gain around 20 pounds in the past 0.5 year. I am now 10 pounds away from my highest weight ever and acknowledging it makes me want to die. But, that caused me to quit stuffing my face long enough for me to feel hunger again and BOY did that feel good. I forgot how addicting restricting was because I was in a good mental place. Now, the only way to not feel like complete shit is to feel hunger again. My biggest fear now is for this whole experience to turn into a never ending cycle of gaining weight + depression --> unhealthy restricting + losing weight. Sigh.",
