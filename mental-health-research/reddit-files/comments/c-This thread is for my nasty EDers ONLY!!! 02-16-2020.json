But thankfully my big ED brain self went and paid a homeless guy/guy who was collecting bottles nearby to help me lift the bucket into the dumpster (lid was on the bucket thankfully).",

Due to some weird-ass reasons I don't feel like getting into, my desk was in the garage in high school, and the garage was a separate building. I went to firehouse subs and got one of their 2-dollar 5-gallon pickle brining buckets and would purge in there. Not only was it in a separate building (so no one could hear), but the thing smelled so fucking strongly of pickles that it honestly overpowered the vomit for like, the first three gallons",

                "Text": "I\u2019ve been suffering from anorexia since I was 10/11 (I\u2019m 23 now) but when I was in high school, I\u2019d b/p from time to time. One of those times, I ate an entire loaf of chocolate chip banana bread before school and didn\u2019t realize my mom was still home until it was too late. I couldn\u2019t purge if she was home! She knew too much already!\n\nSo I ran out the door, got into my car, and drove to the nearest grocery store to purge. However, their bathrooms were broken so I just had to rush to school. Everyone knew about my eating disorder (it was, and still is, painfully obvious) so I couldn\u2019t purge at school but I couldn\u2019t keep this loaf of banana bread in my stomach so... I grabbed a plastic grocery bag, crawled into the backseat of my car, hunkered down and purged right there in the parking lot.\n\nI thought I was in the clear! Nope. There was a hole in the bag. The world really didn\u2019t want me to purge that day. Vomit was leaking out all over my car and I had to think QUICK. My course of action? Dump the bag out all over the back of my car and on myself to make it look like I got sick and drove back home.\n\nYea. My mom knew. Why would the vomit be in a plastic bag (that I forgot to toss) and in the BACKSEAT if I \u201crandomly\u201d got sick. I was in treatment less than a month later \ud83d\ude15",

Due to some weird-ass reasons I don't feel like getting into, my desk was in the garage in high school, and the garage was a separate building. I went to firehouse subs and got one of their 2-dollar 5-gallon pickle brining buckets and would purge in there.

Needless to say I took the lax just to get rid of the horrible pain in my stomach from eating so much compared to what I was used to.\n\nI took 2 and nothing happened then took another 2 as I didn\u2019t expect it to do anything as I read 4 is the upper end of a normal amount to take. Little did I know my body couldn\u2019t handle it\n\nI was 17 or 18 at the time and honestly it\u2019s all from those years I remember. I was crying from the pain and I was so sick and I honestly thought I was going to die that night. I was blacking out unable to make it to a toilet or a fridge to see if food would help. I chugged water and chugged some more until I threw it up all over the floor and then I fell in it unable to move. It was absolutely disgusting and of course on top of that I had lax. \n\nThankfully throwing up almost instantly made it better I was weak for a few hours but enough to get up and get a snack before taking a cold shower ( I\u2019m sure I would have passed out if I had a hot one as It is very difficult to take hot showers  with an ED and even in recovery sometimes)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t wish this pain in anyone please if you want to try lax don\u2019t!! You never know when you will take it too much and even if this doesn\u2019t happen it doesn\u2019t give the desired effect. You may become dependent upon them and the tiny tummy will turn into a never ending pregnant like bloat from using them. It isn\u2019t worth it. Stay safe your body is going through enough.\n\nEdit: the reason I am proud of this is that I\u2019m still alive to tell the tale tbh. Nobody in my family ever found out and my amazing pain tolerance made it a little easier to keep my folks asleep from the screaming.",

We were allowed to take as much food as we wanted home, so I would do just that. I would take probably 3kg+ of baked goods home every day, and then lock myself in my room to eat all of it. Obviously, being bread, I had to make sure I had at least a litre of liquids to go down with it so I could bring it back up again. Because I was living at home, I became an expert in vomiting into plastic bags on the floor of my bedroom. \n\nBut then I just had all these grocery bags full of vomit, so I'd go out onto my balcony and drop them over the edge into the bushes.
