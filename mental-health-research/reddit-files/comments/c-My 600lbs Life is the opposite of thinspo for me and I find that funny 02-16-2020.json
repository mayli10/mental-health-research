Eating disorders are hell no matter what size you end up at and there's not much separating the super morbidly obese from others with more restrictive/purging EDs besides the size they end up at.\n\nI don't think there's been a single person on that show that wasn't abused in some way, neglected as a child or molested. Many also grew up in poverty and childhood food insecurity is such a huge contributor to later problems with binge/comfort eating. These are real people who were often dealt a bad hand from the start and turned to food to cope, in the same way that others may turn to alcohol or drugs or self harm or restriction. ",
