They are very very different from greyhounds, whippets, salukis. They need extensive socialization as puppies (at 10 weeks mine was already rejecting the touch of strangers) and will need a lot of management as adults. They\u2019re can be pretty vicious guard dogs and only attach to their families. So if you have friends, visitors, children over...you need to either crate your dog or set up a gating/fencing system within your home for your visitors safety. I only let mine loose with a select few people he\u2019s known for years and he doesn\u2019t approach them but knows they\u2019re safe. My boy is the love of my life but I will only ever own one Aza at a time because they are so incredibly difficult to own and are a huge liability. \u2764\ufe0f just a warning",
