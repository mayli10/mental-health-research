But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT.

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

If they're maintaining their weight, they'll average out to their TDEE (obviously, there are no exceptions to this) but they'll do things like eat 20% of their TDEE one day then 180% of it the next. Over two days this balances out to 100% of their TDEE, but they'll be nearly fasted one day and then eat a ton of calories the next.\n\nThat's pretty normal, by the way. Everyone I know who has a healthy relationship with food will overeat sometimes, and undereat other times.\n\nI, too, overeat sometimes and undereat other times.

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

                            "Text": "Idk but almost all calorie calculators online say that my tdee is 1,365 (im super short and sedentary). I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

                            "Text": "Idk but almost all calorie calculators online say that my tdee is 1,365 (im super short and sedentary). I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

                            "Text": "Idk but almost all calorie calculators online say that my tdee is 1,365 (im super short and sedentary). I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",

I might have been exaggerating the fat as fuck part but comparing my body structure to a skinny friend when were both sedentary and not that far off height wise (i'm 5'1 she's 5'3) i kinda really do look chubbier (meaning I have chubby-ish arms and thighs) considering I eat so little compared to her and I calorie count religiously so I couldn't have been underestimating. But someone here mentioned NEAT which is really starting to make sense to me now since it mentioned lifestyle AND genetics play a role in how much calories an individual burns, how different jobs could also affect an individuals NEAT. I used to think non excercise activities couldn't really affect metabolism THAT much but holy hell I'm wrong I guess.",
