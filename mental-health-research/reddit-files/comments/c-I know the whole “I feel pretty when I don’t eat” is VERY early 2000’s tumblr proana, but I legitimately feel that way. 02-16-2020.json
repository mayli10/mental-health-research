I was at a really dark place in my life emotionally and I threw myself into the idea of heavy restriction and I felt fucking INVINCIBLE. I felt like I had a dynamite little secret under wraps and I floated along feeling empty and strong and tougher than everyone else.\n\nI've fluctuated between restricting and binging (lol) since that point, about a year later now, and even at my heaviest restriction I still don't get that rush of euphoria. I mean, I think the reason it felt so powerful is because I was at such a low point, so the slingshot made it feel so much stronger, so maybe it's good that I haven't reached a point as low as that since lol. And I also know that technically I shouldn't feel good about doing this. But like... I'm doing it anyway, right? Might as well feel proud because I sure af don't feel full LMAO",
