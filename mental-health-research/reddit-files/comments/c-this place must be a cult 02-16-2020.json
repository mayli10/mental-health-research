I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I also enjoy the trash aesthetic that drinking an monster gives me lmao.",

It is funny though, whenever I'm home my mom always freaks out that I won't eat any fruit and makes a big deal out of it, which is probably a normal reaction tbh",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I really like diet soda as well, but mostly drink that when I'm at home trying not to binge, so energy drinks fit into my life nicely. I also enjoy the trash aesthetic that drinking an monster gives me lmao.",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

Maybe because I found it hard to believe it was so gross? Whatever happened, it grew on me. \n\nI drank energy drinks anyway, I generally like the taste better than coffee, and I like mixing up my caffeine sources so I don't get too bored. I really like diet soda as well, but mostly drink that when I'm at home trying not to binge, so energy drinks fit into my life nicely. I also enjoy the trash aesthetic that drinking an monster gives me lmao.",

Some of the things I thought it tasted like:\n\n* Pure, liquefied altoids mango sours\n* Freshly-milked fruit gushers\n* Blue raspberry compote but you forgot to turn the burner off\n* Battery acid with all-natural\u2122 fruit flavoring\n* Washing down a whiskey sour with Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette\n* Drinking the runoff of a malfunctioning A/C unit\n\nOne day I might come to appreciate its... unique qualities, but for now I'm going to stick with my EC stack and Diet Coke to get me through the day. Thanks all for listening to this nonsense.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I just finished the whole thing because I feel like a murderer whenever I throw away perfectly good food and I'd say [I'm at a 6](https://i.imgur.com/FXV5gXn.jpg), overall could be worse",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP.

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

It is funny though, whenever I'm home my mom always freaks out that I won't eat any fruit and makes a big deal out of it, which is probably a normal reaction tbh",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

Maybe because I found it hard to believe it was so gross? Whatever happened, it grew on me. \n\nI drank energy drinks anyway, I generally like the taste better than coffee, and I like mixing up my caffeine sources so I don't get too bored. I really like diet soda as well, but mostly drink that when I'm at home trying not to binge, so energy drinks fit into my life nicely.

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I really like diet soda as well, but mostly drink that when I'm at home trying not to binge, so energy drinks fit into my life nicely. I also enjoy the trash aesthetic that drinking an monster gives me lmao.",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I really like diet soda as well, but mostly drink that when I'm at home trying not to binge, so energy drinks fit into my life nicely.

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

It is funny though, whenever I'm home my mom always freaks out that I won't eat any fruit and makes a big deal out of it, which is probably a normal reaction tbh",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP.

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",

I'd been a barista at a few coffee places on-and-off and I'd gotten to the point where I'd be downing 2+ 32oz uniced cold brews/day and taking some home with me after my shifts just to feel normal. It was so bad that I decided to stop when I quit before going back to school just so I could get over the withdrawal ASAP. I had awful awful migraines for a while and I'm convinced I've been permanently affected by it, although for some reason I find sleep-deprived eyes to be very attractive on others (I thank college for giving me this pavlovian response).",
