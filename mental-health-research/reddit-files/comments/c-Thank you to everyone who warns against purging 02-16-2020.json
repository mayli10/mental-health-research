And the dumbest part is I know you're right, I know purging isn't even the magical \"undo\" button I think it is, but like most people my ED is just as much about self harm as it is about my weight so I'm also drawn to it for the idea of being able to purge my behaviour and my sins along with my food. Like, I fuck up, so I suddenly get this idea to throw up because I don't feel like I deserve the food I ate, or that I'll be punishing myself and that will make up for whatever it is I fucked up. That's what makes it more appealing to me, but I remember people like you who have been there and are begging me not to and so I stop myself. I have an addictive personality (lol BED anyone) so I know I can't. Thank you, thank you so much \u2665",

I'm T1 diabetic and was at the hospital the other day talking to my insulin pump rep, we were going over my blood sugars and my food etc, and I said something along the lines of 'I'm a binge eater, especially at night' (bearing in mind I was saying that my blood sugar had used to be a lot worse so my results that day were great for me) and she laughed a bit and said 'oh aren't we all'. \n\nI didn't correct her because that's not really what we were there for, and she wasn't the right person to tell to get help anyway, but it was still kind of an 'oh yeah, that's how much it flies under the radar' moment.

I'll admit sometimes when I'm really compelled to purge a sick part of my brain thinks that it would make me more valid or tragic to start purging. Nobody takes disordered behaviour seriously in fat people like me unless we get REALLY serious. But, I don't do it. And it doesn't make my problem less significant. Thank you xx \u2665",

I'm T1 diabetic and was at the hospital the other day talking to my insulin pump rep, we were going over my blood sugars and my food etc, and I said something along the lines of 'I'm a binge eater, especially at night' (bearing in mind I was saying that my blood sugar had used to be a lot worse so my results that day were great for me) and she laughed a bit and said 'oh aren't we all'. \n\nI didn't correct her because that's not really what we were there for, and she wasn't the right person to tell to get help anyway, but it was still kind of an 'oh yeah, that's how much it flies under the radar' moment. She knew how much damage binge eating does as a T1 and it was still laughed off",

I'm T1 diabetic and was at the hospital the other day talking to my insulin pump rep, we were going over my blood sugars and my food etc, and I said something along the lines of 'I'm a binge eater, especially at night' (bearing in mind I was saying that my blood sugar had used to be a lot worse so my results that day were great for me) and she laughed a bit and said 'oh aren't we all'. \n\nI didn't correct her because that's not really what we were there for, and she wasn't the right person to tell to get help anyway, but it was still kind of an 'oh yeah, that's how much it flies under the radar' moment.

I'm T1 diabetic and was at the hospital the other day talking to my insulin pump rep, we were going over my blood sugars and my food etc, and I said something along the lines of 'I'm a binge eater, especially at night' (bearing in mind I was saying that my blood sugar had used to be a lot worse so my results that day were great for me) and she laughed a bit and said 'oh aren't we all'. \n\nI didn't correct her because that's not really what we were there for, and she wasn't the right person to tell to get help anyway, but it was still kind of an 'oh yeah, that's how much it flies under the radar' moment. She knew how much damage binge eating does as a T1 and it was still laughed off",
