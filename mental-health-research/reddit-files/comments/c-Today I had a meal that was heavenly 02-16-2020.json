Now almost nothing tastes like what I'm hoping for.\n\nOf course, I know this is because when I was binge eating, it didn't matter if something tasted bad, because I could just keep eating until I had something good. And now that I can't/don't do that, I actually remember the meh food, and it feels like a waste.\n\nBut on the flipside, when I actually do have something good now, it feels so, so much more special and memorable. I hope you get yours soon; those kind of \"omg this is perfect\" meals come from the weirdest places, lol.",
