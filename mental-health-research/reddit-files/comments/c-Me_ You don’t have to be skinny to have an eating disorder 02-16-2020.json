It makes me feel guilty about my own body because I feel like I'm somehow bad at having an eating disorder for not being at their weight and for not looking like they do.\n\nBut at the same time I try to remind myself and correct my jealousy. Because I know that mentally and physically, it's draining so they're not doing okay. Their ED causing them a lot of distress they may not show. I feel sympathetic towards them, but I don't like treating anyone with EDs like they're pitiful. It makes me uncomfortable when people do that to me, so I won't do that for others.\n\nBut also, you shouldn't really be using the labels \"fat\" or \"skinny\" to describe someones weight in this sub because it can be triggering/harmful to some people.\n\nI do get that you're asking a genuine question, and that you didn't mean that in a harmful way. I'm not upset, I'm only pointing it out for future reference since you've only just joined this sub, and reddit in general.",
