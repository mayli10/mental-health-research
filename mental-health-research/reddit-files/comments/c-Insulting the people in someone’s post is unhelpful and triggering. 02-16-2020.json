                "Text": "Agreed. I think people can overreact in the comments not only here, but I see it on reddit as a whole often. People will read ONE venting post about someone's relationship from one frustrated perspective and then flood the comments like \"wow he/she is horrible, you need to break up now this is abusive\" and I just think that's not enough information to say someone is for sure in an abusive relationship (which is a VERY serious accusation, coming from someone who has been in abusive relationships) or they NEED to break up. Sometimes a post is appalling enough or has enough info to indicate something is wrong with a relationship but people tend to jump to overreactions so fast. Often the OPs have not even tried to discuss their issue they're ranting about with their partner, gone to counseling, or taken ANY steps to repair it or fix the issue. If people just walked away from relationships whenever anything went wrong with no communication or attempt to fix it, it'd be impossible for anyone to have a serious relationship. Very few couples are perpetually perfect and never ever bother or offend each other.\n\nPeople on here especially tend to be EXTREMELY sensitive to comments about weight/body, which is understandable but also means you need to take comments with a grain of salt when complaining about partners. Often times I see people posting venting about an innocent partner accidentally saying something hurtful and then comments treating them like an absolute monster who needs to be dumped asap. Oftentimes men do not understand EDs and can say hurtful things without realizing. Try to keep that in mind and discuss it with your partner if they continuously make comments that hurt you. More often than not they are not trying to hurt you and would be horrified to know how affected some posters here are by their seemingly innocent comments.",

Like the water weight my salt intake was doin that and i only was consuming about 200 cals a day at that point and staying chubby.  I try to tell them by eating right you can be so much thinner heathier and be able to be full instead of starving",

I had to make an account to say this: Go read the thread in OP\u2019s history. NO one was being crude. OP went on a long defensive tirade about how \u201ctotally sweet her man was and that he would never cheat!\u201d and comparing it to women leaving for money (lol?) and someone pointed that out, but that was it.\n\nJesus christ. I know we\u2019re all suffering with our own issues, but this place has people so co-dependent and sensitive that they make a whole post screeching at how \u201ctriggering\u201d it is over the dumbest thing.\n\nSigh. \n\nYeah, honestly? I\u2019m being a dick right now (totally admit that) and yes, your man would and will cheat on you with a thinner and younger woman if he admits he LITERALLY prefers sickly thin women because they are \u201cso youthful\u201d.

Like the water weight my salt intake was doin that and i only was consuming about 200 cals a day at that point and staying chubby.  I try to tell them by eating right you can be so much thinner heathier and be able to be full instead of starving",
