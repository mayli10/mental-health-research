It\u2019s amazing you can recognize this moment and acknowledge that you\u2019re moving forward, even WHILE you\u2019re doing it!\n\nTwo pieces of advice from a recovered (not yet capital r Recovered) 27 y/o with similar patterns:\n1. The longer you go without using the behavior (purging), the less likely you ever are going to do it again. My therapist told me this and I think of it like my brain DEwiring itself. I don\u2019t want to rewire back by going through the old motions.\n\n2. Pay attention to the bingeing. I didn\u2019t purge for 17 months but continued to binge, which maintained a really stressful dynamic w food, but also made it wayyy more likely I\u2019d relapse when other life stressors crept in. Which I did, bc I was still bingeing to the point of discomfort anyway.\nYou surprised yourself with your ability to resist urges, make a change, and see the benefits! Maybe you\u2019ll surprise yourself again and see positive results by eating regularly in smaller amounts, and with others a few times a week.\n\nIt\u2019ll only feel weird to not binge the first few times bc it\u2019s different, then it won\u2019t be so different so it won\u2019t feel so weird!

I appreciate this comment. \n\nIt's basically you have to go through a mental \"detox\" to break the habit.\n\n I guess its important to know because it's never going to be \"just this one time\" or \"I'll only use it when I NEED it.\" \n\nBecause ^^^ is exactly how the spiral started. \n\nRight now I can't phrase it as \"never again\" though because then it's going to be, \"I need one last binge.\" \n\nThis is what I suspected was true- the longer you go without it the less severe the urges will be. I'm trying hard to break the cycle. Again, I really appreciate your comment because it's nice to see someone on the other side and know that it does get easier.",
