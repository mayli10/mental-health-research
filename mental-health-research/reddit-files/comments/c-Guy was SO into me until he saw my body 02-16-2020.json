If you ask for a plastic doll, go buy one haha \n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to have preferences, but being a jerk about it is just rude and cruel. \n\nYou definitely deserve better than him.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

Men do this *especially* and you cannot tell me that they don't when we have greasy cheeto-finger neckbeards saying for a woman to be fuckable she has to be skinny, young, perfect, no scars or fat, no piercings, and blah blah blah and everyone is okay with that because that's the societal standard.\n\n\nI'd also say the same thing about women's asses, too, by the way, if the roles were reversed. Women *also* get hairy butt cracks and anus' but act like that doesn't happen. Everyone gets equal hate for being a complete cunt either way. \ud83d\ude0c It's balanced.",

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

I think that that kind of guys watch too much porn and think that all women should attain those expectations naturally. Like we owed them something ? I never told anything about a guy\u2019s body. If you ask for a plastic doll, go buy one haha \n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to have preferences, but being a jerk about it is just rude and cruel. \n\nYou definitely deserve better than him. There\u2019s plenty of good people in this world, you\u2019ll find someone kind soon enough (sorry for the long answer haha)",

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

The lead role in American Psycho had to literally dehydrate himself to look more muscular. No even talking about P!nk being fat-shamed on a picture of her at a charity-gala.

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it.

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

Men do this *especially* and you cannot tell me that they don't when we have greasy cheeto-finger neckbeards saying for a woman to be fuckable she has to be skinny, young, perfect, no scars or fat, no piercings, and blah blah blah and everyone is okay with that because that's the societal standard.\n\n\nI'd also say the same thing about women's asses, too, by the way, if the roles were reversed. Women *also* get hairy butt cracks and anus' but act like that doesn't happen. Everyone gets equal hate for being a complete cunt either way. \ud83d\ude0c It's balanced.",

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

Now that I have (sad to say this but it\u2019s the truth) experienced turmoil from a really abusive relationship, I am now able to quickly see the patterns in other people/relationships in general, and it makes me wanna yell \u201cred flag!!\u201d anytime I see someone in a situation I used to be in. Aside from that, I know it was really hard to go through it again, but I want you to know that it takes a lot of strength to block the person & really validate your worth on your own; so if anything, feel comfort in knowing how strong you are!!!!\u2014 and be proud of how strong you are!! You\u2019ll find someone who loves you for who you are, and you deserve nothing less than that.",

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

Men do this *especially* and you cannot tell me that they don't when we have greasy cheeto-finger neckbeards saying for a woman to be fuckable she has to be skinny, young, perfect, no scars or fat, no piercings, and blah blah blah and everyone is okay with that because that's the societal standard.\n\n\nI'd also say the same thing about women's asses, too, by the way, if the roles were reversed.

If you ask for a plastic doll, go buy one haha \n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to have preferences, but being a jerk about it is just rude and cruel. \n\nYou definitely deserve better than him.

Porn and media in general tend to sell only one type of body, and it\u2019s really sad to exclude the majority of the population like that. I think that a better and more positive representation of body differences in movies and stories will allow better and kinder relations towards each other as human beings, and ourselves.\n\nAbsolutely. But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks. I think it\u2019s a different kind of difficulty, talking about mental health.\n\nAnd thank you. <3",

Someone I never thought would ever, ever, ever give me anything but the cold shoulder in San Diego and he thinks I am hot as fuck. All this to say, I fucking feel you as there have been guys I know have made comments about my weight and it has made me feel absolutely disgusting but it\u2019s usually because I have rejected them that they bother saying something like that to begin with. But two things for you: a) normal people would never, ever, ever do what that jackass did so I\u2019m confident in telling you he\u2019s suffering with some personal shit he\u2019s taking out on you but most importantly b) no matter what our EDs will tell us about what we think we deserve because of how gross we feel... our weight or size does not determine our worth.

But it\u2019s still so hard for men. My father struggle with Binge Eating disorder, and I know several guys who used to have an eating disorder without putting a word on it. It would be so easier for men to feel better if society allowed them to have feelings and suffer as well. Toxic masculinity sucks.

They rarely mention the huge ton of exercises and compromises those celebrities do too. I mean, they have money and time in their schedule for this because it\u2019s part of their job to body build like hell. The lead role in American Psycho had to literally dehydrate himself to look more muscular. No even talking about P!nk being fat-shamed on a picture of her at a charity-gala. Like, dude, she\u2019s giving money to charity but \u201cSHE FATT, ME NO LIKY\u201d. Gosh. Can we be mammals for one sec please ? Hahaha\n\nThank you. He\u2019s doing better recently. \nYeah it\u2019s evolving, but it\u2019s so slow :/ I know too many guys who never talk about what happened to them and just keep everything in without addressing the issues... It\u2019s sad really.",
