I actually made it with almond flour to reduce the carb content but the first batch became mush in the pot so I had to coat the rest in regular flour anyway. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry yours got ruined! I would have cried for the rest of the day. That\u2019s really awesome that you kept going and made something edible from it though. If you get up the courage to try to make it again I really think you should. It\u2019s calorie dense but very little is very filling and personally I prefer to eat food that was labor intensive. I\u2019m probably making this up, but it always feels like I\u2019ve burned at least some of the calories making labor intensive food so that makes it ok to eat.",
