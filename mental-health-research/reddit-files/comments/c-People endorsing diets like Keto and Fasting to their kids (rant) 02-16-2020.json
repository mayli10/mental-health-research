                "Text": "I cry thinking about the day my daughter discovers body image. I remember when I first developed body image issues at age 11. My daughter is 7. \n\nRight now she makes such good eating decisions and I try so hard to not foster the same restrictive eating habits that my mom did for me. My daughter eats all vegetables and every meal she eats is balanced with carbs, protein, vegetables, a fruit and water to drink. She doesn't like soda or juice and reached that decision on her own. So I really hope that she doesn't develop the same cycle of dieting and eating and body image that I did. ",

                "Text": "Same. I think it is great to teach healthy eating habits like the importance of eating nutrient rich foods, staying hydrated, and not having too much added sugars and such since it has no nutrition and is absolutely awful for your teeth, but like maybe don\u2019t put your kids on a super specific diet and never make your kid fast for the purposes of diet. \n\nIf your child actually has a weight problem and the doctor is involved, definitely reduce calories and stuff if the doctor requests it but don\u2019t tell it to them under the idea of them needing to lose weight either. It should be and entire change for the whole family to feel better and be healthier, I think. Even if the ultimate goal is weight loss, I don\u2019t think you should just flat out tell the child that.  And even at that, unless the doctor gives a specific diet like this, maybe just work on reducing calories and encouraging healthy habits. Don\u2019t put your kid on keto or some fad diet, ",

At least half of the conversation at any get together which is dinner or Thanksgiving or whatever is about calories, carbs, keto, dieting, how much you lost. My cousin's wife is at the high end of normal weight. My mom is overweight. My aunt and SIL are very obese.\n\nSo like I'm happy you're losing weight.\n\nBut here I'm at a normal weight after gaining 35 lbs from underweight from my second relapse with anorexia. And they want my input in these conversations every time.\n\nI'm the go to expert. They know this. I say it's calories. They agree. I agree keto is good especially with hunger control and water weight and it's all calories not just clean eating, but it's portions. They agree.\n\nBUT HELLO. I'm struggling. I lifelong want to be underweight and lose weight and I'm in recovery and gain weight. You've lost 80? Great? You've lost 5? Cool. I've gained 35. These discussions are hard for me. But it's at least half of our conversation everytime we're together.\n\nAnd when I bring up my struggle, or how I've gained, silence. Ignoring. Let's not talk about that.\n\nIt's hard.",

I think both scenarios have to be approached in different ways if there is an issue with a parent or child being at an unhealthy high weight.  \n\nIf a child needs to lose weight, it\u2019s best not to use the term diet but to frame everything with food in the context of eating healthy to be healthy.  If a parent needs to lose weight it\u2019s fine to say that adults sometimes have to diet and work hard to get healthy in lots of ways, emphasizing that a \u201cdiet\u201d is an adult thing that doesn\u2019t reflect on the child at all.  \n\nI personally fast everyday and there\u2019s no hiding that from my family when I don\u2019t eat meals with them.
