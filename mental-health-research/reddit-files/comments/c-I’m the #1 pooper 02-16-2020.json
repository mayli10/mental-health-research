Ultimately the testing was inconclusive so she put me on Trulance, which is some sort of protein that forces your intestines to take in water and liquefy your poop. I took that every day for about 6 months and then every other day for about 6 months and then didn\u2019t really need it anymore. Fair warning\u2014 pooping was a deeply unpleasant and messy experience while on that stuff, but MAN does it empty you out.",
