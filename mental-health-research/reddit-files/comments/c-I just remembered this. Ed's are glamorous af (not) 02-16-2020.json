                "Text": "Oh, oh, oh, I have a good one!\n\nWhen I'd buy b/p food, I usually end up buying more than I could eat because I wanted variety (salty, sweet, hot, cold, etc.) and I'd have some leftover. I'd put this food in the grocery bag, spray it with windex, and then toss it over my fence. The next day I could get the bag and throw it away in a neighbor's trashcan. Well, come the next morning and the binge cravings are going hard and I remember that I have leftover food.\n\nNow, eating food sprayed with windex is gross and bad and it isn't the first time I've done it. But this was 6:30am and I'm in pajamas and messy hair updo and crouched in the bushes eating squished cinnamon rolls from a trash bag. To add to it, the landscapers were setting up for the day and one guy walked through the bushes and happened upon me. He looked saddened and surprised and asked in very broken English if I have a home and am I okay. In extremely broken Spanish, I said something like 'today is not good, I have home, you very nice, sorry you see me' and proceeded to climb the fence back home. \n\nIf only shame could kill you instantly. Ugh, those were darker times.",

Got triggered into a restrictive phase WHILE binging and now I've got 2 boxes of toaster strudels I have to somehow eat while restricting because I CANNOT waste food.\n\nTo make matters worse I am so fucking stressed I cant even bring myself to eat!!! I'm liquid fasting and I've got veggies in the fridge that will go bad soon!!! And usually they're safe but I cant bring myself to eat them!!!! Love that for me!!!",
