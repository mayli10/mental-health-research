I need to remind myself of this constantly.\n\nI struggled with depression and self harm for years and always thought people with EDs were \"better at hating themselves\" than me... So I tried out a lot of the behaviours but they never stuck because luckily I sought out therapy and got better. Then therapy ended (reached max of sessions covered by insurance) and I have been spiraling down all last year, culminating in anorexia. Because of all the therapy I was 100% aware of how bad what I was doing was but I still couldn't stop myself. Starting inpatient next week luckily. Still constantly feel like I did this to myself because I stopped using all the tools therapy gave me.",

No one chooses to actively and continuously engage in emotionally, physically, and mentally damaging behavior. You might choose to do certain things but only because the eating disorder set up that choice. The game is rigged. \n\nIf you think you chose it because you looked at thinspo, mpa, downloaded fitness and diet appes, etc when you were young, what you were actually choosing was what you believed to be your most direct route to control, escape, distraction, purpose, etc. And you believed that because you were already predisposed to develop an eating disorder.

                "Text": "When I was younger I knew what eating disorders were. The typical anorexia and bulimia. I didn't know that binge eating disorder was a thing. I remember wishing I could starve myself instead of eating. As if I chose to have BED and disordered eating from it. I remember in middle school not eating at school and coming home to binge. I was a product of my environment and poor coping mechanisms. As an adult my disordered eating has evolved to new issues and trials. Even when I made efforts to lose weight the \"healthy\" way when I was 22 I was lying to myself. No normal person restricts to 1200 calories or lower but must burn off 500 of it or you failed. I remember asking how many calories in a single m&m and my friend being weirded out by it. I lost 100lbs then and lied to myself that it was the healthy way. I never would have chose this life, the constant regret, constant worry, fleeting happiness when you're being \"good\", messing up and punishing yourself, all of it. Thank you for this post \u2764",

                "Text": "I hated my body and was constantly picked on by friends and family for my body. I was never super athletic either. Also depression and anxiety didn\u2019t help, caused me to want to stay inside all the time and not interact with anyone. \n\nI would see pictures of anorexics, my school had that poster of the bigger girl looking in the mirror and a skeleton thin girl staring back at her from the mirror. \n\nI would think to myself, wow I wish I had control like that in my life. I wish I wasn\u2019t so weak that I needed to eat to be happy. And that\u2019s how it started for me, wanting control and wishing I was thinner/prettier. Because then maybe I wouldn\u2019t get bullied all the time. \n\nNow here I am 12 years later, I don\u2019t know how to eat meals normally and after 4 years my work friends have noticed I don\u2019t eat during the day anymore. I like my job well enough and it pays the bills but I wish I had a more active job so I could burn off this body and have an excuse of being too busy to eat. \n\n\nI suffer from a fun mix of Anorexia and Binge eating disorder which thanks to this community (and I\u2019m sorry if I upset anyone) I have learned is pretty normal among ED sufferers and that I\u2019m not some weird freak that\u2019s faking it \u201cfor attention\u201d.",
