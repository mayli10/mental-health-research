Fuck that, we should start advocating for our health, not our health in compromise of this disorder. Someone convinced us that we'll never recover fully and that's bullshit, 100%. We will recover, because we are regular humans who are deserving of love and a better life. We will, we really will recover, no matter what everyone says. You are entitled to your own pace and path, no one can say how long or personal your journey will be, it's YOURS. You can make it however you want and feel like. Don't let the voice inside your head tell you you're screwed, you never are screwed. You get a second chance every minute on this planet. I know this probably won't mean anything to you or to anyone else reading this, but I just want you to know that I believe in you and you can overcome this. If I did it (I think I did), you can too. I love you, we don't know each other but just know that an european internet stranger REALLY DOES believe in you. \n\nThey want us weak and hopeless? Let's show them how great weak can turn.",
