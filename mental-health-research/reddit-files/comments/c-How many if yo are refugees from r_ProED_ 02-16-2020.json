After I finished studying for my exam tomorrow, I went to bed in my room in the dorms and there was a fucking big ass spider in my light rod (Aussie represent!). I burst into tears and ran into the hall and called my mum because it was too much and she calmed me down, I went back into my room and moved my bed as far away from that light as I could, and I just stayed in bed and could not sleep (my spider phobia gets worse when restricting and when stressed, I've noticed!). About 6am I fell asleep. About 7am I woke up to get ready for my 9am exam. I had a tablespoon of plain Greek yogurt and half a cup of frozen mixed berries for breakfast with coffee #brainfood. Then I went to open proed while I ate my breakfast and it wasn't fucking working, this sounds overdramatic but I was overstressed, overworked and tired and I felt like my world which had been balancing on a pin end just crashed. Years later, I'm in disbelief that I managed to pass that exam haha. But proed going down at that time, all my saved posts just gone... it majorly triggered a relapse into purging.\n\nEdit: hang on, only 2 years ago? Wow.",
