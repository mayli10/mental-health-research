(I realized I\u2019ve always had an eating obsession\u2014either I couldn\u2019t stop or I was obsessive with calories and what I ate.). However, I also binge eat.  Like I\u2019ve had 2 kids and I had lost all the weight right before I got pregnant with the second \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It\u2019s such a struggle.  Either I do really well all day and binge late at night, or I screw up early on and say eff it.  It\u2019s a rare occasion when I can actually say no to food.  I just did for dinner (made a giant salad made up of only veggies (only low calorie), and I spent so much time making it.   That I just didn\u2019t even want it anymore.  I ate a few bites and just wasn\u2019t feeling it.  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll pay for that later around 12 am \ud83d\ude12",

When I was one of those girls who never binged it\u2019s because food never made me happy. I think now that I associate food with happiness it\u2019s easy to fall into that cycle of allowing myself food because \u201ci\u2019m allowed to be happy\u201d but if I remind myself losing weight and that empty feeling in my stomach and self control is what makes me happy, and that feeling after binging makes me unhappy, then it\u2019s easy(ier) to follow through. But sometimes your survival instincts kick in and you just eat. ",
