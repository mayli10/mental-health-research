I had an Asian classmate who got made fun of every other day, and even the teachers would say \"look how tiny she is\", \"do you play violin?\" or \"her hands are so small\"\n\nThe south sucks to be honest. I'd say my area is like 10 years behind the north and western U.S. in terms or progress. I want to move out west lol.",

Not like other black girls. You're basically white\" As if i'm supposed to take it as a compliment\n\nI really feel for Asians living here too. People are so disgusting. I had an Asian classmate who got made fun of every other day, and even the teachers would say \"look how tiny she is\", \"do you play violin?\" or \"her hands are so small\"\n\nThe south sucks to be honest. I'd say my area is like 10 years behind the north and western U.S. in terms or progress. I want to move out west lol.",
