When I was in high school, I was super athletic (competitive swimmer) and a coach once told me to always do 2 things:\n\n\n1.) First thing in the morning and last thing before bed, drink a full glass (16 oz) of water. (That alone is 50% of your daily water needs). I\u2019d just chug it.  Idk that my stomach could handle that now, but it was quick and easy.\n\n\n2.) Bring a water bottle (like a Nalgene or Hydroflask - 20+ ox) with you everywhere and make sure you finish it at least once throughout the day.\n\n\nI should start that up again, but the full glass in the am/pm used to be an absolute essential part of my daily routine, and it really isn\u2019t hard to do. \n\n\nFor me now, idk why I haven\u2019t been able to commit to it again. And this post kinda felt like an aha moment for me a I really never consciously decided to avoid drinking water, but I totally do. And I have no idea why - it makes no sense at all, I\u2019m sure we all know that water is 0 calories and will help shed and bloating or water weight, etc. There\u2019s no logical reason to avoid water for weight-loss purposes, and yet, I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t even drink 8oz per day at this point.
