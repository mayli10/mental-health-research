In some weird logic that makes me think it\u2019s better to stay ill, kind of like I\u2019d rather damage my body intentionally than try to make things better and in the end have them go wrong anyway. Of course that is wrong and recovery is always worth it! But you know, it\u2019s scary to give up control and let my body do what it does without it. I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your friend.",

I didn\u2019t think she would ever get well. We remained in very sparse contact. Recently caught up with her on FB (we live in different countries) to see that despite having brittle bones, she lives a normal life. Though she can\u2019t really do any sport, she has a great job that she loves and recently got married to a man she is head over heels in love with and he is equally so.
