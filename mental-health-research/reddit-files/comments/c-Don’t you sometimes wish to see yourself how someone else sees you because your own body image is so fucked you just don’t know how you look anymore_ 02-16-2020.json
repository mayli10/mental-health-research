( it's off, I just want to lose another few lbs) My hairdresser just looked at me like \"What? You're so thin, you look great\"  No, not yet. All I can think of is how square, (yes, I look like a cube) I looked in all the photos from our family reunion. I thought I was looking good, then I saw those godamed photos. I feel mental because I feel like I've been walking around thinking I'm not bad and then it I actually saw how I really look. Honestly, who the hell would think I'm thin!?! I would love to see myself the way others see me because I think I look like a squat troll. And now I feel even worse because I know technically I'm not fat, but fuck, I'm not thin enough yet!\nEdit, removed exact amount of lbs. It's not a contest, don't want to trigger anyone.",
