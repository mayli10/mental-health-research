Like these funny \"foodie\" quotes about eating a lot etc. \nI have gone from long time restricting and purging to a full blown BED, to the point where I can barely control myself. I still kind of have the same mindset from the restrictive phase, but it's not strong enough, so it just clashes with the uncontrollable urge. I've hated myself before and now that I'm gaining absurd amounts of weight at the speed of light, I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm haunted by food.\nBinges are very traumatic for me.\n\nSo when I see quotes like this, I can't help but think how far away from normal life I am. Binging is seen as fun, being joked about. This T-Shirt is supposed to be funny, and for most people it will. However, it has quite the opposite effect on me.\nIn no way am I hating on people who wear/like this quote or anything. It's just that it reminds me of the rapidly expanding gap between me and \"normal life\"  that I'll most likely never be able to cross. And that makes me very, very sad.\n\n\nI'm sorry for ruining the fun with a rant, it's just something that came to mind while reading this post.",
