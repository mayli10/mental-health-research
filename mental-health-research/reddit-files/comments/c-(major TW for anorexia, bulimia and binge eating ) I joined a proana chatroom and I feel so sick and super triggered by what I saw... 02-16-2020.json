I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you.

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover.

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you.

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

Although, I can't feel angry at most of those people so much as depressed, bc I can't even imagine the mindset and life circumstances that would lead someone to purposely try to become anorexic, or to encourage others to do so (especially when they KNOW many of the people asking for \"inspiration\" are like twelve).\n\nBut then there are people who basically just use the \"proana\" label bc it implies that the community is not aggressively pro-recovery (but also not anti-recovery). Like, I know \"not pro just using the tags\" is a bigtime joke/cliche, and that most people who used those tags WERE toxic \"orthodox\" proanas, not \"reform\" proanas, but others really were just looking for community and didn't know where else to find people. This is how I ended up in the pro-ana world in middle/high school. I was never \"orthodox\" at all, and p much only followed blogs that were about the reality of EDs: the emotional/mental problems, the hospitalizations, etc. I just needed to feel less alone, and found incomparable support for my emotional difficulties and socially unacceptable feelings. I even made a real-life friend, and later encouraged her to recover. I learned things - really important things, like the dangers of purging and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nFor those reasons, I can't condemn the whole proana label. The proana that helped me is the same kind of \"pro\" that dominated the old sub (ProED). The old sub had some serious issues, but it was a valuable resources in many ways. I'm glad we now have this sub instead, which offers the same support with less toxicity.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you.

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I honestly don\u2019t know what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t had the emotional support of the group I joined. \n\nEveryone was just so real about the downfalls and awfulness of the disease, because it sucks. I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

                            "Text": "It wasn't my point at all that people with mental illness aren't responsible for anything ever, and life just isn't black and white like that. I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

                            "Text": "It wasn't my point at all that people with mental illness aren't responsible for anything ever, and life just isn't black and white like that. I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover.

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you.

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

That\u2019s nuts!\u201d Keep in mind, I hadn\u2019t been dx at this time and my mom just thought I was \u201cskinny\u201d. (Still doesn\u2019t believe I have an ED, just an attention whore)\n\nI was dumbfounded that such a thing existed but elated because I felt so very alone in my illness. It was a bad time and I know it absolutely fueled my disorder.",

I honestly don\u2019t know what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t had the emotional support of the group I joined. \n\nEveryone was just so real about the downfalls and awfulness of the disease, because it sucks. I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I keep stand-alone journals to help me get over stuff I'm going through now.\n\nThat person you're freaking out and getting upset over could be anyone, anywhere doing anything. They can be people who know you IRL who pretend to live overseas and they find out too much about you and follow you around. I think they can be any gender or age and masquerade as 13-14yrs old.\n\nIt could be a metaphor for something else and they've dressed up an assault, crime or animal sacrifice. It could be a sick joke that has nothing to do with eating disorders. They dumb themselves down on purpose to obscure their offline identities. Social media gives you infinite license to be manipulative, even in the pro-ED world.\n\nI get angry with the offline world as well for advocating pro-ED stuff and being sneaky about it (media, etc). They won't show a full picture- they just give you bits. The paranoia and brainwashing is meant to work its magic afterwards. I think it's really mainstream but they can cover it up and make it look happy/positive.\n\nIt masquerades as status anxiety. If eating disorders are really common, whatever the majority prefer has a lot of influence and it can distort normalcy so they can behave abnormally. Pro-ED isn't what it was 20yrs ago. It gets swept under the carpet which is how these pro-ED sites emerge. The modern world is crazier and more enabled imo. It's repressed.\n\nNo one talks about how they're feeling and what's going on in their heads and how they feel about their bodies. Should you? It's your choice. Will any good come from it? I think people's bodies are their responsibility now more than ever because the modern world is enabling.  We're illusionists. ED sufferers like that woman who was interviewed on Oprah still exist.\n\nThey're dressed up, wearing makeup and in functional jobs and relationships pretending feigning obliviousness to their health and weight. In the 90's and 00's there was more honest media exposure of eating disorders. Afterwards a shadow was cast over it and it was buried by younger generations who grew up during a boom in technology. It had a ripple effect. It was like a Molotov cocktail.\n\nIt's trendy to destroy proof. There could be people in offices stabbing sharp objects into equipment, laughing about it together and farting, cheering \"no more!\", buying out small companies in small groups and putting the manufacturers in jail. They'll never show that on TV\n\nHow their influence (younger generations) mixed with the influence of older generations and what society was creating and where their heads were at- the impact of pressure in the developing world. It's like we are making these unspoken deals with each other through our lifestyle choices etc and it's not based on common sense, it's fight/flight and just adapting to stuff we don't understand.\n\nMental health takes a back seat. What's resulted is a passive acceptance of disorder and it's being integrated. People have to decide how they're going to treat their bodies independently of anything else. It's simultaneously empowering and disempowering because the responsibility is on the individual. We're effected and influenced by each other",

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

That\u2019s nuts!\u201d Keep in mind, I hadn\u2019t been dx at this time and my mom just thought I was \u201cskinny\u201d.

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

That\u2019s nuts!\u201d Keep in mind, I hadn\u2019t been dx at this time and my mom just thought I was \u201cskinny\u201d.

I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I honestly don\u2019t know what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t had the emotional support of the group I joined. \n\nEveryone was just so real about the downfalls and awfulness of the disease, because it sucks. I legit learned about the true dangers and how to at least take care of myself and \u201cminimize\u201d the damage I was causing. \n\nNo one yelled at you for not being ready to recover. BUT if and when a lot of us \u201crecovered\u201d everyone was so happy for you. And when you relapsed for the 3rd, 12th, 50th time or swung from AN to BN to not-quite-sure wtf you are anymore, they were there to help you again. nd now still, it\u2019s nice to have a community of people that just \u201cget it\u201d, sometimes you just need to make a joke about your disease and have people actually find it humorous, or at least relate. It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

It\u2019s a very isolating disease. \n\nI have friends now from back then, I\u2019ve seen the devastation EDs have on peoples lives \u2014 I\u2019ve lost several people to it, but I\u2019ve also been able to see people move on and get better and it just makes me so so happy for them.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",

I think being harsh to oneself about the struggle isn't helpful. Yes, we as mentally ill people all do things that aren't in our best interest but why should we beat ourselves up about it so much? I think we're already beating ourselves up enough just by having eating disorders. I also think we all know that recovery is an ongoing process, and slip-ups happen. I just don't think it's helpful to be so hard on ourselves.\n\nAccountability is important and that's on the individual. I didn't see OP as acting holier than thou, to me, it seemed like OP was just venting and more that she was talking to the eating disordered side of those chat room individuals directly. But that's just my perspective.  \n\n\n**Edit responding to your second point after your edit, this part:** *\"I just don\u2019t understand complaining about something you did to yourself.\"*  \n\n\nI mean, in that case, what are any of us doing? You could argue that all of us are responsible for giving ourselves eating disorders and causing this shit to get worse within ourselves so what right do we have to complain? I don't think that's a healthy perspective. People need to vent, even when they do stuff to themselves. Think about the example of addiction, many people who are addicted to drugs chose to do the drugs, got addicted to the drugs, and made their own lives worse because of their choices. Should they just stfu and not talk about their struggles? I don't see this being helpful at all.",
