It\u2019s hard to put my finger on it, but the focus is different when I\u2019m freaking out over a smaller binge. I only freak about small binges when I\u2019m in \u2018super restrictive\u2019 mode, and it feels critical to minimize every calorie I eat. Eating anything more than I planned feels like complete and utter failure.\n\nWith large binges, it\u2019s less dependent on my current restriction mode. But it\u2019s just a sudden complete loss of control where I can\u2019t stop eating no matter how full and uncomfortable I am. Which is distressing with or without worries about weight gain.\n\nHaving experienced both, they both suck, but I can see how stressing about small binges can feel invalidating to others.",

                    "Text": "Exactly.\n\nThe only addition I'd make to your post is that, for me, \"small binges\" can also happen when I'm not restricting super low. E.g. if I had planned to eat 2,000 calories, I eat 2,000 calories, and then I can't resist and I eat 2 pounds of cherry tomatoes (which in total will be like what, 200 calories?) I freak out and call it a binge.\n\nBut yeah, the rest is pretty much what I experience. But in the case of \"small binges\" - aka subjective binges - I likely wouldn't come here to vent about it nor I would try to purge it, because my ED is mostly about calories. I'm sure that for someone else it can be different.",

I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

                        "Text": ">ED\u2019s, after all, are physical in nature just as they are psychological. I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

                        "Text": ">ED\u2019s, after all, are physical in nature just as they are psychological. I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I think some of them are also \"testing the waters,\" so to speak - if they say \"Haha, oh, one time I mainlined a package of Oreos, what a pig amirite!\" and everyone's like, \"Oh that's really not that bad,\" maybe they can go \"... well actually it was more like three packets. And a thickshake\" and people can go \"NOW we're talking.\" Because obviously, if people think they're a pig after eating 1 packet they're not going to admit to eating 3+.\n\nBut I do think a not-insignificant number of people in threads like that are just trying to show off or validate/prove something. Like, even if you felt like you were in a binge mindset, you HAVE to know that if your worst binge story ever is like, \"one time I ate a King-size Mars bar instead of the normal size!! GASP\" You're... doing pretty well. It's like, instead of seeing it as an opportunity to vent about over-eating struggles, they just see it as an opportunity to signal how well they must eat normally if even their binges are within reason.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

                        "Text": ">ED\u2019s, after all, are physical in nature just as they are psychological. I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",

                        "Text": ">ED\u2019s, after all, are physical in nature just as they are psychological. I don\u2019t think a true ED could be 100% psychological; that would just be disordered eating or BDD or something else\n\nI can kind of see where you're coming from but I think this is a little bit back-to-front. I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.\n\nI do think you're right that a person's physiology plays a part, though. Some people are just wired to receive hunger, pleasure, and satiety cues differently, whether it's nature or nurture.",
