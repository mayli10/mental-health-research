It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!!

Then again I always felt plenty of white fat/binge eaters existed in media as well. \n\nTo be fair, no one would\u2019ve guessed I was bulimic. I ended up confessing to my parents. Pisses me off that they now tell me I \u201clook skinny\u201d even when I\u2019m gaining weight. Feels like a fake ass compliment.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lotta bullshit around eating disorders so I\u2019m really sorry that race has to cross into it for some people. It\u2019s stressful enough as it.\n\nIf it makes y\u2019all feel better, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, because I struggle so badly with food and body image that my first assumption is that most other people probably feel similarly to some degree.

It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!!

It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!!

Then again I always felt plenty of white fat/binge eaters existed in media as well. \n\nTo be fair, no one would\u2019ve guessed I was bulimic. I ended up confessing to my parents. Pisses me off that they now tell me I \u201clook skinny\u201d even when I\u2019m gaining weight. Feels like a fake ass compliment.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lotta bullshit around eating disorders so I\u2019m really sorry that race has to cross into it for some people. It\u2019s stressful enough as it.\n\nIf it makes y\u2019all feel better, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, because I struggle so badly with food and body image that my first assumption is that most other people probably feel similarly to some degree.

It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!!

It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!!

Pisses me off that they now tell me I \u201clook skinny\u201d even when I\u2019m gaining weight.

It\u2019s stressful enough as it.\n\nIf it makes y\u2019all feel better, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, because I struggle so badly with food and body image that my first assumption is that most other people probably feel similarly to some degree.

It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!!

It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!!

It felt like, \"look, a black girl!! And she's not conventionally attractive!!! Arent we great!!\" Oh and she was a lesbian, which plays into the fat butch lesbian stereotype.\n\nBut I agree, black people dont exist in ED culture very much and that's kind of the point, people act like only the wealthy can willingly starve themselves, like you said.\n\nAnd I also treat everyone as if they might be self critical because I dont want to be the reason a person feels the way I do.\n\nI enjoyed this lil back and forth, thank you for your input!! And take care of yourself as much as you can",
