I apologise since my title definitely makes it seem like she overreacted!\n\nThis particular comedian was an opening act and wasn\u2019t getting much of a reaction from the audience. \n\nSo the gist of the initial joke is: he came over to our table and went \u2018oh there\u2019s someone there! I was looking at her sideways and it looked like a floating burger\u2019 or something. Which actually made the audience (me included) laugh a little, but because it was one of the only successful jokes, he pretty much stayed by our table his entire set to make jokes like, \u2018hey waiter, more burgers for this table! God knows she needs it\u2019, \u2018look she\u2019s picking up the fries but I can\u2019t tell where the fries end and her arms start\u2019, \u2018c\u2019mon dad, give her back her carrot, is that what happens at home?\u2019 etc etc. \n\nIt was just a little uncomfortable because he was singling me out and no one was really laughing at that point. I wasn\u2019t too angry but my family was definitely a little uncomfortable & my sister is more outspoken about things like this. \n\n\nIt was more a charity show than a proper stand up show!

(Though since it\u2019s a famous club sometimes you will see famous people trying out new stuff which is cool.)  its actually really fun because even if someone is bombing, you know the next act will be up quickly. \n\nHowever it is THE WORST when someone is bombing and tries to get laughs by calling out people\u2019s physical appearance. Hey look at that guy! He\u2019s fat!\u201d followed by fat jokes. Or \u201cThat woman\u2019s really tall!\u201d followed by tall jokes. Or \u201cThat guy is ginger\u201d etc. It\u2019s just so uncomfortable when someone is making unfunny jokes about everyone.",

Imo her sister being appalled and wanting to talk to him afterward was a sign that she was offended. If you're easily offended, you shouldn't be going to live comedy shows, because comedians often riff off the audience; that's part of the deal when going to a show, that you might get made fun of. If you don't like that possibility then don't go.",
