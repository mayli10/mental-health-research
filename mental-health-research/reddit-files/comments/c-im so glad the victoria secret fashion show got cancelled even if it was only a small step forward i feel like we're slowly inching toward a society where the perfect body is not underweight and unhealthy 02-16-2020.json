                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",

                            "Text": "From [CDC.gov](https://CDC.gov):\n\n\"The following are some examples of how certain variables can influence the interpretation of BMI: \u2022 **On average, older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults for an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **On average, women have greater amounts of total body fat than men with an equivalent BMI.** \u2022 **Muscular individuals, or highly-trained athletes, may have a high BMI because of increased muscle mass.**\n\nWhat are some issues to consider when using BMI for children and adolescents?\n\nThe concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child\u2019s degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.\"",
