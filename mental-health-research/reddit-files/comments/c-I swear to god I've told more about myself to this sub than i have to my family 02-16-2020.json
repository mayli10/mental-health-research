I made a consultation appointment at the local eating disorder clinic.\u201d \n\nMy mom\u2019s response \u201cmaybe they\u2019ll tell you you\u2019re fine and you can just go home!\u201d\n\nGreat mom. That\u2019s super helpful. She didn\u2019t have anything to say when the eating disorder center said they had a 5 month waiting list but made room to get me into treatment the next day because it was an emergency. \n\nShe\u2019s never been capable of being there when I was struggling. I could never tell her anything because it \u201cstresses her out\u201d and then my abusive dad would punish me for upsetting her. If I told her something in confidence, like about my dad being abusive, she would pretty much immediately tell him.

                "Text": "My ED didn't develop until I was already not living at home, but my family can be so cavalier with their comments about food/weight/exercise and it's so frustrating because they ALL know how bad it was \u2014 not all EDs result in someone being underweight but mine did at the time so they literally SAW how bad it was. I love them, but I can't imagine living at home with them as a teenager and dealing with that. I'm sorry you're going through this!",
