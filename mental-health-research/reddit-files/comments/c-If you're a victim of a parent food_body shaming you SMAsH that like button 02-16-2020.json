She was sitting in my chair with a head full of foils as I was a hairstylist at the time and would do her hair for free...let\u2019s just say her ass got kicked out of my salon and I went no contact for half a year.

My brother used to be bug like at school growing up and she would call him a beached whale and I'm not gonna lie I did too because I didn't realise what it meant until a year or so after it started. Then he went to the other end of the country for uni and got fit.\n\nI went to uni near home and I put on about 10kg so i was only just above the good weight for my height in bmi so I don't think i was particularly big and because I'm tall it didnt even show much. So I became the target so I started doing the good ol not eating much or cooking my own small things like salads but that was being ungrateful and she would get angry and say I won't cook dinner for you anymore if you insist on making your own separate. So naturally I went back to eating as before but this time I would go and make my self throw up because it was too much and I wouldn't lose any weight.\n\nShe still says things like you look fat and things and I think I'm slowly going back into the starvation ideology because my brother is now home too and calls me jumbo and fatty all the time.\n\nI'm 5'9 and 74kg, I'm not fat in anyway. Yes my legs are a little thick but that's literally where all my body fat is located so can they just shut up please omg.\n\nSorry.",

They laughed at me when I was 11, saying that I looked like I was pregnant and that they in my age.. But somehow all we ever had at home was sweets and really fatty meals and when I wanted to do sports, they actively discouraged me. I mysteriously dropped 30kg after moving out and discovered that sports are about training and having fun, not actually having a talent and being good at it straight away.

                "Text": "It really is a testament to how disgustingly pervasive disordered eating is that even though I have a good relationship with my mom, and I love her, and she isn't skinny or particularly preoccupied with weight/appearance... I still have lots of memories of her body/food shaming me, lol. Some unintentional as a projection of her own insecurities, some intentional but kind of kneejerk, if that makes sense. I remember growing up feeling super anxious or embarrassed to ask for \"unhealthy\" food, but also confused because the food my mother regularly got for me wasn't always healthy either. It's like she was more than happy to ply me with junkfood providing I didn't ask for it.\n\nIf I were ever confident in my appearance as a chubby pre-teen/fat teenager, she would shoot me down, I think because she was anxious on my behalf that I would get treated badly for it (as if I wasn't already treaded badly for my size) and she wanted to preemptively protect me from that... only the things she said were super harsh. Sadly I think there was also maybe a little jealousy in there. The older I get the more I can see that my mother has truly struggled/suffered with her weight her whole life, too. I don't think I want kids but if I ever did I would try my hardest not to pass this on to them, too.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on my dad, lmao. He's the one who overfed and neglected me until I was a stuffed little sausage, then when I wasn't somehow skinny (even though neither of my parents were skinny and I ate the same foods and portions as them so how did he expect it to go??) would shame me and sign me up for sports or exercises that I HATED because he didn't ask me what I would like to do (e.g. weight lifting, swimming or martial arts) and instead just forced me to do whatever he thought I should do (e.g. basketball or gym sessions with an impatient personal trainer).\n\nIt gave me massive anxiety about sports and gyms that make it harder to get fit now as an adult - it's hard to tell yourself that nobody is looking at you, that nobody thinks you're a nuisance at the gym, etc. when you have a whole childhoood of people staring at you jiggling down the basketball court and a PT who was visibly frustrated with you not being able to do a push up as a fat 11yo.\n\nSorry for the MASSIVE wall of text, I guess I treated you like a therapist \ud83d\ude02 But yep - it's disgusting how common body/food shaming from parents to their kids is, even with kids who don't consider themselves to have disordered eating.",

Which was like daily or my ballet teacher would make brownies on my birthday for everyone but she would give me a really judgemental look whenever I reached for a brownie. She also fit everyone into a costume but picked the smallest one she could find and humiliated me in front of everyone in rehearsals about how I didn\u2019t fit into the costume. I was the only person who didn\u2019t have a costume thanks to her and she kept saying things like,\u201dNot even close!\u201d Or \u201cNot even a prayer will fit you into this.\u201d with the different tutus and I really, really hated myself for it. I still have problems now where I think I\u2019m way too big compared to other girls or that I\u2019m wide and it\u2019s ugly. \n\nLike I said, it\u2019s never reached an eating disorder. Although I have considered laxatives and making myself throw up (I did that a couple of times) I have never really gone through with them. It\u2019s such a shitty thing having people who are suppose to take care of you completely destroy you instead in that way and not even understand that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. Like you\u2019ll tell them but it just does not register at all with them due to their completely ignorance to our feelings and denial that anything could be different from their perception on what they\u2019re doing. Sending much love to anyone dealing with this. It\u2019s so sad. \n\nI ate myself sick tonight and I\u2019ve never felt more guilty in the last year. Take care of yourselves as much as possible. \u2764\ufe0f",
