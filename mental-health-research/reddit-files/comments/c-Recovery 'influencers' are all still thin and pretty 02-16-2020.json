Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.",

Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then? If not, why are you only making this point for donuts?",

I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

                        "Text": "That's actually incredibly normal. After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\".

In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges.

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then? If not, why are you only making this point for donuts?",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition.

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\".

                            "Text": ">I would, and then I would purge. Because my monkey brain was traumatized when it was developing and I still don't know how to be normal with food. Which is...the entire situation here. An ED brain and a non-ED brain do not function the same. Can't really make the comparison of a starved non-ED person and a self-starved person with an ED.\n\nSo we're looping around the same point. The problem is not the binge, but your reaction to it. Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours. In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

[This mentions that it lasts 3-6 months after being weight restored](https://www.scienceofeds.org/2014/05/07/hypermetabolism-in-anorexia-nervosa/) and we don't really have much info to go off of about the recovery girls. But I can't check her work. \n\n>It's actually a huge pet peeve of mine because it's not realistic to perpetuate 1. that an eating disordered person's body \"knows what it needs\" \n\nUGH!! I hate this so much too. In the world that we live in, just listening to your body makes no sense. Our bodies adapt soo much to the circumstances that we're in. It's not that simple.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain.

Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges.

Maybe that's where the conflict in our statements are, unless you're saying it's completely healthy and normal for someone who has been severely restricting to down three pizzas in one sitting and get refeeding syndrome. If you're referring to a large meal as a binge, then sure, I'd agree that it's normal, but saying that people in recovery for anorexia should just binge is just encouraging the development of a different type of eating disorder. And by calling binging normal and not unhealthy, you are encouraging binging, so don't accuse me of not reading your posts.",

It's simply wrong to put it into moral/health categories in the context of recovery from a restrictive ED.\n\n>The cure for an eating disorder is not disordered eating. Not now, not ever.\n\nIs not disordered eating *if driven by ED thoughts*. Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place. So yeah, in my case I did view them as \"healthy\".",

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain.

Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then?

I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients.

Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\".

Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

So yeah, it can count as such.\n\nAnd by the way, you could very well see an anorexic as an extreme version of someone who hasn't eaten enough for a while.\n\nTo summarize: if the individual has a restrictive ED and has no actual severe medical issues that would make a binge objectively dangerous, such as the risk for refeeding syndrome, I do and will always maintain that\n\n-a binge isn't necessarily bad and/or unhealthy and doesn't necessarily need to be framed as such;\n\n-sometimes it can be an appropriate reaction;\n\n-it doesn't have to be actively encouraged, but stigmatizing it through bold statements like yours is one of the least helpful actions you could do against said individual.\n\nNow, if you want to keep on ignoring what I said and portray me as a dangerous preacher who promotes binges and says everyone should just eat his way into oblivion regardless of the circumstances, do it.

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition.

Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome.

Because my monkey brain was traumatized when it was developing and I still don't know how to be normal with food. Which is...the entire situation here. An ED brain and a non-ED brain do not function the same. Can't really make the comparison of a starved non-ED person and a self-starved person with an ED.\n\n\\>At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change\n\nAgreed. However, it shouldn't come before addressing  why someone engages in behaviors. It should be done in a way that will benefit the person. \n\n\\>then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable\n\nThis feels like arguing semantics. I don't disagree. I think the first food steps in recovery need to be re-teaching a disordered body how to eat, which is mechanical eating. Which should include all foods, such as binge triggers and fear foods. \n\n\\> mentally ready to deal with them\n\nArguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours.

                        "Text": "That's actually incredibly normal. After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

                        "Text": ">I would, and then I would purge. Because my monkey brain was traumatized when it was developing and I still don't know how to be normal with food. Which is...the entire situation here. An ED brain and a non-ED brain do not function the same. Can't really make the comparison of a starved non-ED person and a self-starved person with an ED.\n\nSo we're looping around the same point. The problem is not the binge, but your reaction to it. Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours. In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain.

I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

                        "Text": "That's actually incredibly normal. After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\".

In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges.

If you're referring to a large meal as a binge, then sure, I'd agree that it's normal, but saying that people in recovery for anorexia should just binge is just encouraging the development of a different type of eating disorder.

It's simply wrong to put it into moral/health categories in the context of recovery from a restrictive ED.\n\n>The cure for an eating disorder is not disordered eating. Not now, not ever.\n\nIs not disordered eating *if driven by ED thoughts*. Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place. So yeah, in my case I did view them as \"healthy\".",

                        "Text": "People faced with food scarcity can experience a lack of control around food, and many other symptoms that mimic ED behaviours, even when they don't have an ED themselves - see once again the Minnesota study. And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them.

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain.

Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then? If not, why are you only making this point for donuts?",

I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients.

Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\".

Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

So yeah, it can count as such.\n\nAnd by the way, you could very well see an anorexic as an extreme version of someone who hasn't eaten enough for a while.\n\nTo summarize: if the individual has a restrictive ED and has no actual severe medical issues that would make a binge objectively dangerous, such as the risk for refeeding syndrome, I do and will always maintain that\n\n-a binge isn't necessarily bad and/or unhealthy and doesn't necessarily need to be framed as such;\n\n-sometimes it can be an appropriate reaction;\n\n-it doesn't have to be actively encouraged, but stigmatizing it through bold statements like yours is one of the least helpful actions you could do against said individual.\n\nNow, if you want to keep on ignoring what I said and portray me as a dangerous preacher who promotes binges and says everyone should just eat his way into oblivion regardless of the circumstances, do it.

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition.

Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful.

My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable.

Because my monkey brain was traumatized when it was developing and I still don't know how to be normal with food. Which is...the entire situation here. An ED brain and a non-ED brain do not function the same. Can't really make the comparison of a starved non-ED person and a self-starved person with an ED.\n\n\\>At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change\n\nAgreed. However, it shouldn't come before addressing  why someone engages in behaviors. It should be done in a way that will benefit the person. \n\n\\>then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable\n\nThis feels like arguing semantics. I don't disagree. I think the first food steps in recovery need to be re-teaching a disordered body how to eat, which is mechanical eating. Which should include all foods, such as binge triggers and fear foods. \n\n\\> mentally ready to deal with them\n\nArguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours.

Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

Which is...the entire situation here. An ED brain and a non-ED brain do not function the same. Can't really make the comparison of a starved non-ED person and a self-starved person with an ED.\n\nSo we're looping around the same point. The problem is not the binge, but your reaction to it. Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours. In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

I really struggle with bread like I can only physically eat a few bites and I\u2019m painfully bloated. I asked her how long it took her to build up to that, and got the shock of my life when she replied with a nasty comment accusing me of \u201cgaslighting\u201d her (what? How) and calling me names.\n\nThat was the irony right there, in accusing me of calling her out when I wasn\u2019t, she\u2019d called herself out. She isn\u2019t being honest I don\u2019t think she\u2019s recovered at all and probably doesn\u2019t eat all that bread.\n\nI was super upset and disheartened over her comment and I lost my faith in the lot of them. She had been *seemingly* the most sincere but actually she\u2019s full of shit and she\u2019s mean as well. \n\nFuck the lot of them. I imagine true recovery is freedom from obsession with food and weight, and keeping an influencer level IG accounts full of food pics and pics of yourself still super UW is not it.\n\nRecovered people are busy living their lives, being happy and doing other shit.\n\nI am not a believer in IE at all, and think the \u201cpath to recovery means eating vast quantities that normal people would never\u201d rhetoric is a load of nonsense.\n\nAlso I agree with the other poster who said emotional recovery has to come first or at least alongside. I\u2019ve weight restored a bunch of times without resolving the underlying issue; it was not sustainable. Not in 1996, not in 2003, not in 2013, it\u2019s not going to be this time either if I try that again. Surface recovery isn\u2019t recovery. Recover the soul and the state of the soul will be reflected on the outside, with a healthy and normal weight body.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.",

                        "Text": ">dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food\n\nWhat do you mean? Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then? If not, why are you only making this point for donuts?",

                            "Text": "Lots of foods make me feel sick. Also when I say nutrient dense I'm not talking calories. I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

                        "Text": "That's actually incredibly normal. After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours. In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges.

If you're referring to a large meal as a binge, then sure, I'd agree that it's normal, but saying that people in recovery for anorexia should just binge is just encouraging the development of a different type of eating disorder.

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

I ate 2 donuts and the sugar made me sick. If I had eaten like, granola and oatmeal with almond butter, then a donut, that would not be the case. Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain.

Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then?

I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients.

Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\".

Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

I've personally seen a nurse wolfing down three large McDonald's cheeseburgers and fries after a single day long shift where she had been unable to eat. Not underweight or anything, just very very hungry. Or even just the aforementioned Minnesota study. So once again back to my question: why would you frame it as bad or unhealthy in that case?",

So yeah, it can count as such.\n\nAnd by the way, you could very well see an anorexic as an extreme version of someone who hasn't eaten enough for a while.\n\nTo summarize: if the individual has a restrictive ED and has no actual severe medical issues that would make a binge objectively dangerous, such as the risk for refeeding syndrome, I do and will always maintain that\n\n-a binge isn't necessarily bad and/or unhealthy and doesn't necessarily need to be framed as such;\n\n-sometimes it can be an appropriate reaction;\n\n-it doesn't have to be actively encouraged, but stigmatizing it through bold statements like yours is one of the least helpful actions you could do against said individual.\n\nNow, if you want to keep on ignoring what I said and portray me as a dangerous preacher who promotes binges and says everyone should just eat his way into oblivion regardless of the circumstances, do it.

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them.

I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition.

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.

Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable.

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\".

In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field.

I bet the % of anorexics who have binged in recovery at least once is close to 100. So yeah, it's normal.\n\nI maintain that binges aren't necessarily, always, automatically, inevitably unhealthy when recovering from a restrictive ED, and that sometimes they can be framed as an appropriate, even \"healthy\" behaviour. This doesn't mean encouraging them, or promoting them, or saying they're always good and desirable, or saying that they can never be an unhealthy behaviour, or stating that they are the best or only form of recovery possible. I explicitly wrote that I do not encourage them as I believe they increase the risk of relapse; so yeah, you're not reading my posts, and I will stop replying until you do, since I don't see the point in arguing about things I never said.",

The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.",

Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then? If not, why are you only making this point for donuts?",

I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges.

(by the way, \"regular meals\" in itself is a very vague expression)",

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

But with enough practice, learning, self love, and repitition, we can learn enough about what we specifically each need, and don't, and that we can get pretty damn close to intuitive. \n\nI'm nowhere near the end of the road with my work towards that goal, but that's what I've learned, and what has worked best for me, based on what I know from compiling and making connections between the different kinds of research I've done.\n\nTL;DR Imho, ituitive eating shouldn't be the goal or method, healthy lifestyle based on MANY more varied personal facts, and practiced until it becomes second nature should.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.

Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome.

                        "Text": "That's actually incredibly normal. After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\".

In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

I bet the % of anorexics who have binged in recovery at least once is close to 100. So yeah, it's normal.\n\nI maintain that binges aren't necessarily, always, automatically, inevitably unhealthy when recovering from a restrictive ED, and that sometimes they can be framed as an appropriate, even \"healthy\" behaviour. This doesn't mean encouraging them, or promoting them, or saying they're always good and desirable, or saying that they can never be an unhealthy behaviour, or stating that they are the best or only form of recovery possible. I explicitly wrote that I do not encourage them as I believe they increase the risk of relapse; so yeah, you're not reading my posts, and I will stop replying until you do, since I don't see the point in arguing about things I never said.",

The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them.

I feel like I'm still engaging in disordered behavior because I weigh my food and eat mostly clean, but if I didn't, I'd easily eat double the amount I'm aiming for. (I'm trying to weight restore at a rate of about 2 kg in a month.) I feel like I might have originally developed my ED to suppress this boredom-eating impulse.\n\nWhen I'm not around food, I feel normal, but when there's a lot of food at home, especially multiple types of something, such as four kinds of fruit or two kinds of leftovers, I get overwhelmed and feel like I have to finish them quickly. I used to often have to eat quickly even if I wasn't very hungry as a child or my 4 siblings would eat everything, so maybe that's the reason. Whenever I had a personal snack, it was always huge and my parents let me finish it all at once, so I didn't learn about serving sizes.\n\nI can't eat intuitively either, because I mainly feel emotional hunger, not physical, so I'd skip a lot of meals if I was 100% honest with my hunger cues. However, when I start eating, I get hungry and as I eat, I get hungrier instead of less hungry until I'm stuffed. I don't know when to stop eating before that even if I eat slowly and chew properly. That's why I have to portion out my food and never go for seconds. I hope I'll learn to intuitively take normal portions some day by repeating it often enough with the help of the food scale. Also I started a blog to keep myself accountable. Among other things, it prevents me from doing a binge with the excuse of OMAD. I hope my body will get used to regular meal times and I'll start getting genuinely hungry near those times. I want to learn normal eating habits and weigh restore on a food plan that can be easily adapted into a maintenance plan so I don't have to overhaul my diet again. If I listened to my body, I'd be eating only Nutella from the jar and chocolate-covered protein bars, because even though I love normal food, those hyperpalatable things would make it taste bland in comparison.",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.",

Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then? If not, why are you only making this point for donuts?",

I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges.

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

So yeah, it can count as such.\n\nAnd by the way, you could very well see an anorexic as an extreme version of someone who hasn't eaten enough for a while.\n\nTo summarize: if the individual has a restrictive ED and has no actual severe medical issues that would make a binge objectively dangerous, such as the risk for refeeding syndrome, I do and will always maintain that\n\n-a binge isn't necessarily bad and/or unhealthy and doesn't necessarily need to be framed as such;\n\n-sometimes it can be an appropriate reaction;\n\n-it doesn't have to be actively encouraged, but stigmatizing it through bold statements like yours is one of the least helpful actions you could do against said individual.\n\nNow, if you want to keep on ignoring what I said and portray me as a dangerous preacher who promotes binges and says everyone should just eat his way into oblivion regardless of the circumstances, do it. I know what I wrote and I hope the others know as well.",

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition.

So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then?

Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

Because my monkey brain was traumatized when it was developing and I still don't know how to be normal with food. Which is...the entire situation here. An ED brain and a non-ED brain do not function the same. Can't really make the comparison of a starved non-ED person and a self-starved person with an ED.\n\n\\>At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change\n\nAgreed. However, it shouldn't come before addressing  why someone engages in behaviors. It should be done in a way that will benefit the person. \n\n\\>then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable\n\nThis feels like arguing semantics. I don't disagree. I think the first food steps in recovery need to be re-teaching a disordered body how to eat, which is mechanical eating. Which should include all foods, such as binge triggers and fear foods. \n\n\\> mentally ready to deal with them\n\nArguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\".

After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients.

Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\".

Also, I wasn't underweight when I went through treatment, and I had been maintaining my weight through the binging and compensatory behaviors, so my body wasn't starving. Just because you are hungry enough to eat 10,000 calories a day doesn't mean that it's healthy to eat so much at once or to gain weight that quickly.",

                        "Text": ">I would, and then I would purge. Because my monkey brain was traumatized when it was developing and I still don't know how to be normal with food. Which is...the entire situation here. An ED brain and a non-ED brain do not function the same. Can't really make the comparison of a starved non-ED person and a self-starved person with an ED.\n\nSo we're looping around the same point. The problem is not the binge, but your reaction to it. Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours. In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

I have a friend of mine who never had an ED but once lost a lot of weight due to depression after a bad breakup. She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges. Now she's back at her previous weight and the urge to binge has gone. It's basically the same that has happened to the participants to the oh-so-famous Minnesota starvation study.\n\nAlso, the argumentum ab auctoritate just doesn't work in the ED treatment field. There are so many different treatment approaches and no single consensus exists - if it did, EDs wouldn't be so damn hard to treat.",

Not underweight or anything, just very very hungry. Or even just the aforementioned Minnesota study. So once again back to my question: why would you frame it as bad or unhealthy in that case?",

And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",

Like, my body just wants fast carbs when it has the chance- it doesnt necessarily no what it needs nutrition wise. I would rather have donuts despite them making me sick over veggies and chicken and rice and fruit, because I still eat veggies and chicken and fruit (not rice tho) because I never let myself have them. And in recovery, at least for a while, I need to purposefully choose what I need over what I want (maybe having what I want as a snack later vs a full \"meal\") because my malnourished body will ask for any high carb high calorie food i can get but i need to give it nutrient dense food.\n\nObviously this is anecdotal and I'm not trying to start an argument- just saying that myself and many others dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food during recovery so it might have to be mechanical rather than intuitive that we eat it",

Mechanical eating is the standard for a reason. I do believe that intuitive eating has a place in recovery - just not up front. Getting the mental part of EDs under control has to come first IMO. I think it's setting someone up for failure to pretend that unrestricted eating is going to help them at all if they haven't dealt with why their ED is there in the first place.\n\nI never learned to eat in my first go at recovery. I was force fed TV dinners because the treatment center I was in believed in calories>nutrition. Of course a lot has changed in the last 15 years and now the data all pretty much shows that nutritional rehabilitation predicts the best outcomes for ED recovery. \n\n>Mh, do they? Or do they deep down know what they want but they are actually too scared to do it?\n\nOur bodies and minds change in response to how we feed them. Restriction will cause people to be food obsessed and changes brain chemistry. It's not a matter of having the \"willpower\" to overcome this. It's not \"pushing aside a fear\". A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own. If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\n>Of course it's painful, you wouldn't have an ED if it wasn't\n\nIt's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.",

                        "Text": ">dont find themselves craving nutrient dense food\n\nWhat do you mean? Donuts *are* a nutrient dense food.\n\nAlso, usually what happens when I crave a donut (I never personally crave donuts, I don't like them, but it's an example) and eat granola/oatmeal instead, is: I eat granola/oatmeal, still crave a donut, eat more granola/oatmeal, finally end up binging on donuts.\n\nYou say it yourself: your body craves donuts, or whatever else, because they are a quick source of energy. So why shouldn't you eat donuts? They make you feel sick, okay. But many foods in recovery are going to make you feel sick - should you just avoid them forever then? If not, why are you only making this point for donuts?",

                            "Text": "Lots of foods make me feel sick. Also when I say nutrient dense I'm not talking calories. I mean like iron, magnesium, potassium, etc. \n\nA further example, I'm lactose intolerant. I crave dairy like crazy. Doesnt matter how often I eat it (usually in small amounts daily) I still crave it. I eat it, then I shit my brains out, because I cant digest it. Yet my body wants it. Doesnt seem intuitive to me.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to peanuts. If I eat them I get intense stomach pain. Same with peanut butter. Yet I constantly crave peanut butter. The craving goes away if I eat almond or cashew butter. But if that isnt around and I eat peanut butter, I will end up in terrible pain.\n\nFuther, I'm hypoglycemic. I'm supposed to avoid things with high amounts of sugar (like donuts). Despite this, I crave them constantly. If i eat something high sugar without pairing it with slow releasing carbs, fat, and protein, i will get shaky and probably pass out from my blood sugar rapidly dropping. This is what i mean by my body isnt necessarily intuitive- it craves things that *will* guaranteed make me sick, even if I didnt have an eating disorder.\n\nThings like donuts or other snacks are okay, as long as I eat them after a meal instead of in place of a meal like my body seems to tell me to.\n\nEven intuitive eating experts acknowledge that people with an active eating disorder cannot eat intuitively- you need to get your body to a healthy place, but more importantly your mind, or else it just doesnt work (as said by the people who promote intuitive eating!!)",

A starved brain can't make necessarily sound food decisions on it's own.\n\nIt's not about willpower, it's about retraining your brain. And a starved brain also doesn't necessarily *need* to make sound food decisions. If you were a starved hunter who suddenly found a dead buffalo, why wouldn't you binge on it?\n\n>If someone is genuinely afraid of going into binge eating, it's not really helpful to tell them to just binge through it. \n\nYeah, the same goes for whatever fear. I am incredibly afraid of having breakfast and snacks (and also quite afraid to have lunch), to the point that I sometimes can't sleep if I know I'll be forced to eat them the next day; therefore, according to this logic, any meal plan that includes any meals other than dinner isn't sensible/helpful. At some point, recovery has to be about facing your fears, otherwise nothing will ever change - you can't recover while appeasing your ED.\n\nClearly you can do it in stages, with a certain speed - but you have to do it at some point. And I don't see why the fear of binging would be different from any other fear in that respect.\n\n>It's physical pain. That fucked up digestion catches up to you. I was constipated for months. My blood sugar still hasn't calmed down. Night sweats are miserable. It's horrible.\n\nThat goes for normal meals as well. If anything, binges accelerate the normalization process.\n\nNote that I do not *encourage* binges, mostly because I feel that they can make a person prone to relapses - BUT theoretically, if someone CAN make it through the fear and the anxiety and all the panic, then binges in recovery aren't anything inherently wrong or bad or despicable. (I can't, of course, but that's another story)\n\nThe only case where I would absolutely discourage binges even if the person was mentally ready to deal with them is when said person is at risk for refeeding syndrome. But you're usually out of the danger zone if you're not super super underweight and have eaten anything resembling a decent amount of food for the last few days.",

                        "Text": "That's actually incredibly normal. After you've restricted/purged for so long there's going to be a disconnection between your stomach - that signals you're physically full - and your brain - which tells you you still need to eat because cells haven't enough nutrients. Plus, there is still the mental problem that one comes from a background of imposed self-starvation, therefore the person instinctively tries to eat as much as possible out of the fear that the food won't be there again anytime soon. \n\nI personally sometimes feel overly full with quantities of food that I just know are nowhere near enough, especially if those food are high volume. Anorexics in early recovery can find themselves uncomfortably full on less than 1000 calories a day. Of course they are still going to feel hungry and unsatisfied, because their body actually needs more than that. Over time, the two types of signals come to an \"agreement\". I still don't see where or why a binge would be an inappropriate behaviour in this context, provided you don't have actual medical issues that require avoiding binges.",

Therefore it seems to me that what you need to change is the reaction (basically, your ED thoughts), not the action. Therapy can address that, especially given that binges are primarily a biology-driven behaviour for most people with a restrictive ED (read: a consequence of restriction).\n\n>Arguably, someone who isn't dealing with anything else about their ED other than the food aspect isn't \"mentally ready\". I don't think I have to put up a poll asking how many people in this very sub were \"mentally okay\" with a binge one day and then did something to compensate within hours. In fact, I myself have been trapped in binge-restrict cycles that have lasted months.\n\nAgain: I am not mentally ready to have lunch and breakfast. Does this mean I can recover without having them? Does it mean it's bad if I get a meal plan that includes lunch and breakfast?\n\nThe point is that you seem to see binges as something that in recovery must never be welcomed and must be avoided at all costs. I don't agree with that - if anything they need to be put in a different perspective, maybe renamed as \"binge\" carries an emotional meaning like it's something \"wrong\" and completely messed up, but they don't necessarily need to be stigmatized.",

She used to maintain a BMI of around 22 but in those months she lost about 20 lbs and went down to a BMI of 19 (not underweight). When she started to feel emotionally better she also experienced powerful urges to binge and gained all her weight back in a short time. \n\nThe difference between her and ED sufferers is that she didn't care and didn't cast any type of jugdement on the binges.

If you're referring to a large meal as a binge, then sure, I'd agree that it's normal, but saying that people in recovery for anorexia should just binge is just encouraging the development of a different type of eating disorder.

Unfortunately, in most cases it is - but if someone binges out of starvation that's not an ED thought, pretty much the opposite indeed.\n\nI for one thank my binges everyday - when I was at my lowest weight I was so entrenched in my disorder that if it wasn't for the binges I would have surely died. The binges helped me not only gain weight and achieve both a half-decent physical condition and a better mental state that then helped me going through therapy, but also was the single biggest factor that made me realize that I actually had a disorder in the first place.

                        "Text": "People faced with food scarcity can experience a lack of control around food, and many other symptoms that mimic ED behaviours, even when they don't have an ED themselves - see once again the Minnesota study. And a sense of lack of control is also very much intertwined with your personal feelings around the binge - in other words, if you feel guilty about what's happening and view it as bad you're also more likely to feel like you're losing control. The distinction between objective and subjective binges is mostly based on the number of calories consumed, rather than the feelings around them. Anyways, I don't know about the nurse, probably she was able to stop because her conditions of food scarcity had only been going on for a day rather than months or years as in the case of people with restrictive EDs or the participants to the Minnesota study.",
