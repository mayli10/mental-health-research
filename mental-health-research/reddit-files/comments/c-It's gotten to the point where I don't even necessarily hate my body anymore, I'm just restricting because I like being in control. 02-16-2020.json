Eating a sandwich for lunch that makes me feel satisfied enough (not even full) that i\u2019m not thinking about food or counting down the hours to dinner feels like i\u2019ve given in and let myself go which reaffirms that i have zero willpower and like i\u2019m a failure compared to who i was when i was actively trying to lose weight.

I actually don't have that much size dysmorphia that's related to body image specifically. As long as I'm UW I usually feel pretty ok about the way I look. \n\nI just feel like gaining or even maintaining weight is representative of like... a moral failing on my part. I feel like if I can't lose weight it means I can't get other things I want, and that bad things will happen in my life in general. \n\nWhen I say \"I feel fat\" it usually means more like \"I feel gluttonous and out of control and indulgent and spoiled and selfish\" rather than \"I feel like my body looks fat.\" Restricting just makes me feel like I'm doing something \"right\" when it's often so so hard to know if you're doing the right thing in life :/",
