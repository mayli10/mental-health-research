Not one individual told me to drink the proverbial Kool-Aid that people think they do, like \"you will starve yourself\". \n\nIn fact, I was told by several users on one platform to leave the group, and to \"seek help, there's still time\"; \"don't expect tips\", even though I wasn't. When they realized I wasn't a minor, and that I wasn't looking for tips; or a sicko, (which apparently I didn't know are some people's screwed up kink), I was accepted. \n\nAll I needed to do was talk about what I was going through with those to whom could relate; those that wouldn't judge, wouldn't constantly talk about food, or wouldn't force me to do anything I didn't want \u2014 except to recover.\n\nI, too, love the ED community. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a",
