I find that personally, telling myself I want to not be fat and be skinny sends me into a restriction doom spiral. Skinny =/= fit or healthy. There are plenty of skinny people in the world who are unfit and/or unhealthy. The actions you are taking to become your ideal self, to me, sound like _fit_ cool girl or _healthy_ cool girl.\n\nNot saying that anything you're doing is wrong though! I just wanted to share how I'll be using your technique. I'm going to tell myself that I want to become FCG (fit cool guy) and hopefully, I'll start seeing some progress with that.\n\nCheers :)",
