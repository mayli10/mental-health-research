It\u2019s so \u201csimple\u201d because all you have to do is eat less, but that doesn\u2019t take into account that so much of our social life is wrapped up in food.

I didn\u2019t realize I was an emotional eater until I started heavy restricting, because suddenly when I just wanted some comfort food, I couldn\u2019t have it. And that feeling of deprivation made my emotions even more erratic and stressed me out even more!\n\nSo yeah. I definitely feel you.
