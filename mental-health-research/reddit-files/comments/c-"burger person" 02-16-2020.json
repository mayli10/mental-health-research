                "Text": "Lol. I\u2019ve gotta admit I laughed out loud at the way you wrote this. I\u2019m speaking here as a PERSON who occasionally enjoys BURGERS but also doesn\u2019t want to be known as a \u201cburger person\u201d \ud83d\ude02, but I would take that as a compliment, in a weird way. If they said you don\u2019t seem like a burger person, it probably means you\u2019re thin, or super healthy/fit, someone who looks like wouldn\u2019t eat large amounts or sticks to a strictly healthy diet aka no burgers. No one should feel ashamed of eating a burger every now and then though! But yeah, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s how they meant it, although that is a totally random weird thing to say. People are so overboard commenting on food choices in general, ugh! ",

It's not really a nice thing, eating disorder or not to be given a nickname based on something so normal if that makes sense? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople eat burgers! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn complete honestly he probably see's you as very thin and therefore thinks you must be someone who eats very healthy 24/7. It was most likely a shock for him to see a thin girl like you eating a burger. But honestly there are lots of healthy burgers out there and people just think burger=fast food? I get takeout veggie burgers all the time that are like 400 cals. I am ranting!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOofff that term! I totally understand your point of feelings right now! \n\nBut I just want you to know you have a burger if you want! They are not bad and you are thin!",
