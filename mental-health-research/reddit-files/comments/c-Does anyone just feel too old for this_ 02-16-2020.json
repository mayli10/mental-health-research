It's just a bit more \"popular\" with teens because of pressures from classmates, family, hormones, and a good bit of them thinking \"I'm just going to lose a bit of weight\". Idk I'm a tranny f*g so like, I'm kinda offended that it's just seen as a \"girl\" thing and (I'm not out in my daily life, i can't be, I'll literally lose my family) anyone who has the misfortune of finding out about my ed automatically thinks I'm just some fucking girl who feels fat, and thinks starving will make them look like a vs model. I ignore it, bc obviously I'm not gonna take the time to rant to them about my dysphoria, years of extreme abuse and trauma, shitty coping mechanisms, and the fact that i usually either maintain or gain from binging and it's still not enough to make me stop but like, it's frustrating. And sorry if this rant is all over the place. It's 3:36 am i can't sleep and I'm a fucking wreck and i just need to get this out somewhere. I ended up venting to my ob on Wednesday about my ptsd and religion and hating everyone and goddamn it was a mess. I'm a mess. I'm sorry. I hope things get better for you.",

I sometimes feel isolated being older than the age range of people who appear in documentaries or post on forums, but with age I kinda want to talk about it less.  It feels like I've talked it all out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMental illness have no prejudice.  They affect anyone of any age, race, religion, etc.  I found it easier to do recovery (been weight restored twice) when I was younger.  I think I'm just on a massive downer about this half a century birthday coming up in August.  I'm thinking, what's the point of recovery when really it's all I want.",
