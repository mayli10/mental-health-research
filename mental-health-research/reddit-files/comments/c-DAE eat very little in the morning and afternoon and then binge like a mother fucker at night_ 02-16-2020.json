It sucked because that meant I couldn't eat a ton of food at night anymore which was kind of like my reward for starving the whole day (and in general). My eating habits have been really erratic for like almost a decade tbh and I only recently got them relatively organized less than a couple years ago. It took a lot of weird turns before that happened though. But I do miss the late night binge sessions.",

It sucked because that meant I couldn't eat a ton of food at night anymore which was kind of like my reward for starving the whole day (and in general). My eating habits have been really erratic for like almost a decade tbh and I only recently got them relatively organized less than a couple years ago. It took a lot of weird turns before that happened though. But I do miss the late night binge sessions.",

Like, a *laaaate* dinner around 8-10, of something *very* filling but not necessarily high cal (think like, a bowl of oats, an absurdly large salad, etc.), and then I am *chugging* water until I go to bed, and I try to be in bed+lights out at midnight every night.\n\nThe routine helps my ability to sleep, it helps my mental health (like, a tiny amount. i'm not tryna be one of those \"gEt A rOuTiNe iT cUrEs dEpReSsiOn\" assholes), and it helps me not binge. It ain't 100% effective, but its better than not doing it",

                "Text": "Okay so I have the same issue and what I normally do now is coffee in the morning with half of a protein milk which is 50 cals. Then really nothing at work because it\u2019s so busy and there is no time to eat. I get home and make my dinner ranging anywhere from 400-700 depending on if I eat a salad with it or not. I\u2019ve been trying to up my protein so it\u2019s on the higher side these days. My \u201cdessert\u201d is either a cup of some kind of fruit or sugar free jello and then like 2-3 cups of decaf tea. Usually a fruity flavor. Melatonin helps relax and make you a little sleepy so you don\u2019t go back for more.",
