We got together when I was 20kg heavier so I know its definitely got nothing to do with my weight. My ED however has it's own thoughts on the case. I've recently been progressively getting more depressed/anxious too, so that along with ED is increasingly making it hard for me to enjoy sex. Joys. All I wanted was to lose some weight to look better and enjoy it more, instead it's like I've swapped looks for joy. Except that I dont have either.",
