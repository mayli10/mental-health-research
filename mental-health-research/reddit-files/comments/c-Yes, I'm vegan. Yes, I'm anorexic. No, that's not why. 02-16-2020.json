I didn't develop an eating disorder until years later, and I've stayed veggie through all the ups and downs of that.\n\nYou know how I know they're unrelated? I never have the desire to binge on meat. Everything else that scares me when I'm restricting - soda, big doughy pretzels, peanut butter, brownie batter right out of the bowl, you name it, it all goes down the hatch without a second thought. Never meat, though. It's not that I'm weirdly able to control that desire or something, the desire literally is not there. I look at meat and I don't even think of it as food.",

And I'm sure this has happened to many people. It can cause us to project, kinda like how lots of disordered people can look at someone from the body positive movement and think there's no way they're actually happy with their body.\n\nI'm sure you've thought of that before- but it may be helpful to keep that in mind as you continue recovering, people may just be projecting their issues onto you.

Yes, there are people deep in their illness who use \u201cveganism\u201d as an excuse to restrict... often while not actually living as vegans, just eating mainly plant based foods... but there\u2019s no justification for erasing the many, many people who have been helped, or even had their lives saved, by embracing veganism. Living out your ethics *can be* incredibly positive and affirming, in some circumstances. It can provide that small bit of inherent positive feedback to push past the constant negative thought loops of trying to get to \u201cnormal eating\u201d. There are two residential NHS programmes (i.e. fully publicly funded, open to any seriously ill patient) in the UK which have offered vegan recovery tracks for at least a few years, and the UK is a leading centre of ED research. Veganism per se is not threatening, problematic or wrong. Undereating or eating hyper-restrictively (in an \u201corthorexic\u201d way, e.g. monos, fasting, OMAD, or fully raw) is the truly concerning thing, as are uber high protein diets which negatively affect the kidneys and raise the risk of heart disease. \n\nI\u2019m not by any means suggesting people just jump into veganism tomorrow. But the ill informed anti-vegan posts that regularly crop up in this sub are really worrying; they don\u2019t reflect what is actually healthy vs not healthy in recovery. We should at least try to be as accurate as possible in our terminology, and allude to plant based pseudo-recovery accounts claiming veganism when that is what we really mean (and I agree that these exist, and are frustrating and damaging, but they\u2019re not the face of veganism in recovery).",

                "Text": "The thing people don't understand is eating disorders will disorder any kind of eating. If an eating disorder uses your moral beliefs to create more fuel for your eating disorder, that's not the fault of your moral belief, that's the fault of the disorder. This argument never seems to come up against, say, fair trade chocolate, or \"humanely raised\" beef, or locally grown produce, even though they are just as vulnerable to being manipulated by eating disorders. Because eating disorders... get this... disorder your eating.\n\nAs other people in this thread have said, if people in recovery find that recovery is incompatible with eating vegan, then there are other ways for them to express their beliefs, e.g. in non-food purchases, campaigning, etc. But there's this gross infantilising opinion against anyone with EDs - usually from people without EDs - that trying to make ANY conscious choice about the foods you want to eat vs. don't want to eat is somehow relapse. Guess what! Actually being able to make INFORMED choices about the foods you eat and having CONTROL over the food you put into your body - real control, not \"my inability to eat carbs is actually me having control over something in my life\" disordered control - is what recovery actually is. Being able to say \"No, I don't want to eat that, because I don't want to eat animal products\" is an infinitely more healthful thought process than \"I guess I have to be okay with eating everything or else I'm disordered again\".",

ED commends veganism for restricting from calorie-laden animal products but at the same time condemns it for making pure protein options (because both carbs and fats are fear food) like eggs off the table. And if I consume things that aren't vegan it triggers a full on binge. \n\nI feel pressure from my obsessive thought processes, my mom (who has a history of demonizing carbs which are abundant in all the plants I eat) and my school nutritionist (who has sent me to the ER last week due to low blood pressure) to transition back. \n\nTo me in actuality, veganism is about life, and love, and being kind and caring to yourself and the earth but still being able to create delicious foods.

I truly hate when people think I\u2019m vegetarian because I wanna loose weight. Even though I already don\u2019t consume a lot of dairy I hope to be fully vegan soon :)",

But I have the mental separation to stand up for veganism backup with strong evidence of any kind from years of research and well, doing a PhD on environmental sciences.\n\nAdd.\nAlso luckily, my therapist and psychiatrist not even for one second questioned my veganism. If not I would have fastly change.\nFor the rest of the people, I always state that the hardest part of this is them, the hardest part of veganism is those stupid comments.",
