                "Text": "\\*virtual hugs\\* Rave away and rest well. I'm in a similar spot, but I was never underweight. My goal has always been a BMI of 20. It was glorious. It was the only time in my life where I actually loved my body. I was eating tons, but still less than before, and I was actually in a great spot. Like you said, \"I could wear whatever and it didn\u2019t matter if the outfit was ugly because I was skinny and that\u2019s what matters.\" I'm a few pounds overweight now, and it hurts so bad-physically and mentally. My boobs are always in the way, and I forgot just how awful even a couple excess pounds feels on a short woman. Ideally, I need to stay under 130 lbs. I ache from all the anxiety-driven cardio I do, and I'm trying so hard to lose even 1/4 lb a week.",

I was about 10 lbs underweight when I went into my senior year of high school and now 4 years later I\u2019m like teetering into the obese limit and I feel disgusting. Until this year I thought I had \u201crecovered\u201d from bulimia but I realize that I was just binging without the purging. Good luck on your recovery, let\u2019s hope it gets better",
