                "Text": "I've been reading a lot about \"emotional eating\" recently, more when I was trying to recover for all of 8 days before getting back on the struggle bus. Turns out every decision we make requires that we access our emotions, and without them, we literally wouldn't be able to choose between anything ever. The term \"emotional eating\" sounds kinda stupid to me now, and really just reveals how intensely we *all* hate and try to control our natural eating habits, disordered or not. One anecdote in particular really stuck out to me:\n\n\"Sarah\" has just had a fight with her boyfriend, after a very stressful week at work. She feels terrible, and makes herself a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches with a recipe from her childhood that her mother always used.   After eating the sandwiches, she feels calmer and more focused, better able to deal with her stress and frustration. She had associated the sandwiches with comfort and love, and had she not eaten them, she wouldn't have felt as good and clear-headed as she did, and may have worsened her situation both at work and with her boyfriend.\n\nThe term now just sounds like another way to guilt-trip you for following your intuition with food, and another reason to have to control it lest, heaven forbid, we enjoy what we eat - or worse, gain weight. Seems like the only \"right\" way to eat is by torturing yourself and constantly denying yourself any joy in the action. \n\nI have a lot more to say about this subject, as well as binge-eating and \"intuitive eating,\" but I don't wanna bore y'all. Maybe I'll make a blog or something, idk. Also, I'll totally link the origin of that passage and the bit about emotions and decisions if anyone wants them.",

I've never really understood the idea of \"emotional eating\" because food has never been calming or enjoyable to me, and I tend to associate shitty things with it. There are foods I havent eaten in years simply because of bad associations. I've never taken pleasure in eating or done it to make myself feel better, and am more likely to be put off of food entirely if I'm upset. I just never really see much about this and wasn't sure if it was as common as emotional eating for positive associations? Idk if that makes sense?",

It didn't help me maintain my weight or get healthier. It just gave me a place to vent about how shitty dieting is and how shitty it is to be adapted to starving yourself.\n\nIt's a subreddit that's subtley toxic. Since dieting is one of the biggest triggers of eating disorders (well studied fact at this point) the sub is full of people with all kinds of disordered eating behaviors (that are normalized by others on the sub) even if they don't have an eating disorder. There appears to be a great amount of camaraderie and positivity on the surface, but underneath, it's kind of a disguised dystopia.\n\nThere are plenty of normal people on that sub who preach sustainability and don't have disordered mindsets, and who really do \"get\" weight loss, but in many threads, those people are becoming a minority.",

Is it that I don't deserve to eat these things unless I'm doing really badly, and then since I am anyways and already had some, do I punish myself with a binge and the guilt of the aftermath?\n\nI don't know. I want to believe that I'll find some balance and joy someday.",

I only started restricting this past year because I was so unhappy with the body I had with straight binging for years. I always used to be able to eat what I wanted without getting overweight and still had and still binged incessantly, restriction wasn\u2019t even on my radar and binging wasn\u2019t a response to it. \n\nLike I said I just think it is different for everyone, you may have found your mindset but I think it is different for everyone.",
