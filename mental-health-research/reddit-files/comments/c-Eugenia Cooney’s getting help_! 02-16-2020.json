It would be pretty impossible not to. There is still a chance that she could die in recovery as well though, which would be tragic.

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong.

I feel like that would be true recovery for me, to genuinely not think about \u201chaving an ED\u201d or \u201cno longer having an ED\u201d most of the time. To not have my life always thought of as a \u201cbefore and after\u201d. And so I want to know that it\u2019s possible for others, too, I guess.",

I am not sure how she was even able to stand up or move around at all. I do believe that even if she recovers, she will have lasting physical problems for the rest of her life though. It would be pretty impossible not to. There is still a chance that she could die in recovery as well though, which would be tragic. She really does seem like a nice and sweet person, just terribly mentally ill.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

It would be pretty impossible not to. There is still a chance that she could die in recovery as well though, which would be tragic. She really does seem like a nice and sweet person, just terribly mentally ill.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong.

It would be pretty impossible not to. There is still a chance that she could die in recovery as well though, which would be tragic.

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong.

I am not sure how she was even able to stand up or move around at all. I do believe that even if she recovers, she will have lasting physical problems for the rest of her life though. It would be pretty impossible not to. There is still a chance that she could die in recovery as well though, which would be tragic. She really does seem like a nice and sweet person, just terribly mentally ill.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

I cringed seeing all of the posts, vids and people attempting to publicize or profit off of her announcement (especially fucking Onision AGAIN). \n\nI've always worried immensely for her since her social media blew up, especially since it blew up almost solely because of what she looks like and the ambiguity surrounding her weight and eating habits. I won't say she is *only* famous for her disorder but at this point no one can deny it's a huge contributor to her fanbase/popularity. For these reasons, I feel terribly sorry for her and can't imagine how she'll move forward with a healthy recovery when every part of her social media and life is going to be full of triggering comments telling her she \"looks healthy\", emphasizing how she's gained weight, making direct comparisons on what she looks like vs how she used to. Think about how offended most of us get hearing something like that even once and then multiply it on a much more massive scale. I for one think trying to make her channel recovery-based will not only harm her recovery, but I'm almost positive she will immediately start losing subs/followers/media attention as she gains weight and probably end up on a similar path as alyrealrecovery or w/e because so many of her fans only follow her for her weight.

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

It would be pretty impossible not to. There is still a chance that she could die in recovery as well though, which would be tragic.

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

It would be pretty impossible not to. There is still a chance that she could die in recovery as well though, which would be tragic.

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",

Of course they're not going to be berating her about her disorder in front of the camera. And she's a 24 year old woman. There's only so much they can do as parents.\n\nThey probably want to be supportive of her YouTube career because it's one thing outside of her disorder that she has. She's too sick right now to be a productive member of society. Do people just expect her to lay around in bed all day doing nothing? At least she has something that gives her a purpose or that she can be proud of.\n\nIf they really were trying to exploit her they'd probably make their own channel and talk about her illness without her consent.\n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But I just don't think we know enough about her life outside of her YouTube videos to make assumptions about her family.\n\nSo yeah I think that's a good point that her dad's comments might not be weird but rather because he's upset.",
