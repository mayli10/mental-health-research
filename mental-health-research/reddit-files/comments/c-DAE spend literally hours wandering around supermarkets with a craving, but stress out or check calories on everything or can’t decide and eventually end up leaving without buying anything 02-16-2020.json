I'd go with my dad to get my own food, and just walk up and down aisles trying to find safe foods, on the verge of tears the whole time, because nothing ever felt \"safe\" enough and I'd end up just getting frustrated and not buying anything. That still happens, but not quite as often. But I have good days sometimes, and I'll leave with  5 or 6 safe foods, and THEN\nI'll get home, and my family will eat all my safe foods, and then be *mad* that I'm upset about it.
