So cold water is too different from your body temperature and thus causes issues.... it\u2019s definitely a bit of superstition at play but most beverages are served room temperature or warmer.

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite. And the calories our bodies use to warm the beverage is inefficient (even though to Americans, we use that information as a positive reason to drink cold)\n\n.yeah Im going to try avoiding cold and see how it affects me",

So cold water is too different from your body temperature and thus causes issues.... it\u2019s definitely a bit of superstition at play but most beverages are served room temperature or warmer.

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite.

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite.

So cold water is too different from your body temperature and thus causes issues.... it\u2019s definitely a bit of superstition at play but most beverages are served room temperature or warmer. I Don\u2019t think I ever saw iced drinks unless they were specialty iced drinks",

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite. And the calories our bodies use to warm the beverage is inefficient (even though to Americans, we use that information as a positive reason to drink cold)\n\n.yeah Im going to try avoiding cold and see how it affects me",

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite.

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite.

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite.

I did a quick search and it elaborates on what you said.. that digestion gets funky cause heat/hot foods speeds up metabolism so cold does the opposite.
