There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better.

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better.

I feel like I\u2019m being punked! \n\n-anti-nutrients are only a big deal if you are extremely malnourished.\n\n-You know what else is hard to digest?

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better.

I feel like I\u2019m being punked! \n\n-anti-nutrients are only a big deal if you are extremely malnourished.\n\n-You know what else is hard to digest?

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

Because I\u2019m struggling to find a connection here and honestly, your train of thought (including the passive aggressive judgement regarding my diet) sounds EXACTLY like my mom. \nShe even uses the same type of fear-mongering buzzwords! \n\nI thought I made it pretty clear that I do not have Celiac. After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better. Because I don\u2019t have Celiac disease. \n\n Also, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re implying that I have/had a bad diet and that\u2019s why it I felt badly while I was gluten-free is literally EXACTLY something she would say! I feel like I\u2019m being punked! \n\n-anti-nutrients are only a big deal if you are extremely malnourished.\n\n-You know what else is hard to digest?

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better. Because I don\u2019t have Celiac disease. \n\n Also, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re implying that I have/had a bad diet and that\u2019s why it I felt badly while I was gluten-free is literally EXACTLY something she would say! I feel like I\u2019m being punked! \n\n-anti-nutrients are only a big deal if you are extremely malnourished.\n\n-You know what else is hard to digest?

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better. Because I don\u2019t have Celiac disease. \n\n Also, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re implying that I have/had a bad diet and that\u2019s why it I felt badly while I was gluten-free is literally EXACTLY something she would say!

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business.

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better.

                            "Text": "I agree. There are people who are underweight and healthy who don\u2019t have any eating disorders. There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

I believe it is okay if people are overweight, and doesn\u2019t inherently mean they\u2019re unhealthy, lazy, or any other negative thing. They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business. What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

I believe it is okay if people are overweight, and doesn\u2019t inherently mean they\u2019re unhealthy, lazy, or any other negative thing. They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business. What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t feel better. Because I don\u2019t have Celiac disease. \n\n Also, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re implying that I have/had a bad diet and that\u2019s why it I felt badly while I was gluten-free is literally EXACTLY something she would say! I feel like I\u2019m being punked! \n\n-anti-nutrients are only a big deal if you are extremely malnourished.\n\n-You know what else is hard to digest?

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

I believe it is okay if people are overweight, and doesn\u2019t inherently mean they\u2019re unhealthy, lazy, or any other negative thing. They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business. What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten.

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

I believe it is okay if people are overweight, and doesn\u2019t inherently mean they\u2019re unhealthy, lazy, or any other negative thing. They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business. What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

                "Text": "This reminds me of 2 things: my mom says she has celiac disease and is gluten free, when I say she \u201csays\u201d that, it\u2019s because she tells everyone how she has this horrible disease and can\u2019t eat regular food! She makes a big deal in restaurants and any and all food places she asks if they have gluten free substitution. \nThe truth is, she eats gluten literally everyday. She ate beignets at Disneyland last Saturday. Had a lobster roll for lunch ordered a churro and had a drink of my beer (this was just one day, her day to day is probably even worse!) but then she will complain if a party has no gluten free options (bitch, bring your own!) Or if she doesn\u2019t want to do something she will claim to be sick because she \u201caccidentally ate gluten.\u201d\nI call her out for it all the time and she blows up over it! \n\nShe also says I have Celiac too, (I have an autoimmune disease blah blah blah it\u2019s not important/related.) \n\nI do not have Celiac. They actually tested me for it, mostly to rule it out. (I\u2019m aware the blood tests aren\u2019t always accurate.) I also went completely off of gluten for 6 MONTHS on doctors orders. I didn\u2019t cheat ONCE. They said it could take months for the gluten to leave so it was so important not to cheat. \n\nSo I went gluten free and It actually made me feel way worse.  I had gained weight and still had inflammation. Also, my husband is a PA-C (internal medicine too!) and he has patients who actually have Celiac Disease. He agrees that I do not have it. But my mother thinks she is smarter than him at diagnosing people, (especially me\ud83d\ude44). I\u2019m dead serious about that. \n\nDid I mention my mother has never even had the test or gone exclusively gluten free for longer than a week? Just like your intern, I hate when people are hypocrites about food. You can just say you are gluten free lite or not say anything at all because no one cares what your diet is. You don\u2019t have to box yourself in. Just eat the way you like (low carb for example.) I don\u2019t know who needs to hear this but your eating habits are not a personality trait.\n \nThe weird thing is, I think she really does believe she has Celiac.If you lie to yourself enough, you\u2019ll start to believe the lies. \nIt\u2019s like they tell themselves they eat super healthy/have an actual disease and brag about that while doing the exact opposite.\n\nAnd you also reminded me why I gained 5 pounds: \nI\u2019ve also been binging on drinks, bagels and pastries. \ud83d\ude1e\nI\u2019m 5 foot so 5 pounds means none of my clothes fit right now. And we are going to Vegas this weekend. And I look disgusting.\n\n\nEdit: yikes I\u2019m so sorry for the venting wall of text!",

I suppose it matters what you were eating in place of the wheat. \n\nI don't really eat many grains myself.

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

I believe it is okay if people are overweight, and doesn\u2019t inherently mean they\u2019re unhealthy, lazy, or any other negative thing. They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business. What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",

It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business. What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",

There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don\u2019t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn\u2019t a positive to your health, but it\u2019s not automatically a negative either. It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

I believe it is okay if people are overweight, and doesn\u2019t inherently mean they\u2019re unhealthy, lazy, or any other negative thing. They could very well be healthier than a lot of average weight people. \n\nYou\u2019re also saying the exact same thing I am, we just have different views of what that means. As I said, being overweight isn\u2019t a positive, *but it doesn\u2019t mean someone is unhealthy*. And most importantly, it\u2019s not our business. What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",

After the blood draws, changing my diet etc. and being married to a PA-C, why is it so hard to believe? If I did have it, I would have felt better when I went off gluten.

It\u2019s a risk factor, but 1) that\u2019s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn\u2019t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they\u2019re at risk for. \n\nThere are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat a little more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary, but that\u2019s hardly the worst thing in the world for normal people to do to themselves) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight. \n\nFor example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that\u2019s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they\u2019re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I\u2019m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",

What you do with your body is between you and your doctor. If your loved ones are concerned about your health, they can bring that up with you but it\u2019s not anyone else\u2019s business.",
