                "Text": "Congrats!! I'm 5 months pregnant and it's been a breeze so far (symptom wise.) The hardest part has been the eating. I've gained about 13 pounds so far which is normal I guess but still scary even though it's all in my belly and boobs.\n\nThe first trimester I actually lost some weight and couldn't work out due to being exhausted but now I'm working out and eating anywhere from 2000 calories (I'm tall) to sometimes almost 3k which is awful and scary but it's only when I go to parties or like Easter. It's hard to not starve myself the next day to compensate for days like this and constipation sucks but overall I think it's been good for my mindset and it feels nice to know that my life is a lot bigger than just me now. I feel blessed to know I didn't screw my body up permanently and I'm excited to do things better than my parents (mom unintentionally screwed me up with body image and weight)\n\nEmotions are a whole nother story but I'm so glad to hear your happily married. The support from my husband means the world to me and it sounds like yours will be amazing too. Message me anytime and hope I didn't trigger you with numbers. I've never been diagnosed with anything but this sub is my home away from home.",

                "Text": "Pregnancy is scary but it helps you realize that body image isn\u2019t as important as you thought it was.  I suffered from AN prior to trying to get pregnant and around the time I started to \u201cshow\u201d most of the thoughts about my body were gone and I was constantly thinking about my little one\u2019s body and health and growth and what I could eat to make my baby as smart as possible.  The ED slowly came back about a year after giving birth, but during pregnancy it wasn\u2019t a blip on the radar.  And those 9 months FLY so even if they suck (mine did, I was involuntarily puking all the way to the end) it\u2019s over pretty fast.\n\nI want to address the freedom aspect too.  Make time for yourself and your husband.  It\u2019s imperative.  The first 6 months are crazy because baby will likely cluster feed and won\u2019t sleep more than 2-3 hours at a time (you\u2019ll be so sleep deprived you\u2019ll barely remember it) but after that you and your husband can switch off watching the baby and hire an occasional babysitter to get out of the house.  You won\u2019t have *as much* freedom but you will still have it if you discuss when you want time for yourself.  Thankfully if you already have a stellar marriage then the baby creates a new thing to bond over and love immensely.  It\u2019s primarily when a marriage/relationship is on the rocks when a baby creates more tension and serious problems.",

Becoming pregnant has been a struggle with my body image, but my want to be a Mom is more important than a want to be thin. \n\nJust remind yourself that you don\u2019t need to eat a bajilion more calories. In reality, you need only 200-300 more. The content of what your eating is most important. Reminding yourself that this is for the baby, makes it easier to stomach a bit more food. \n\nIf you\u2019re happy to be a Mom, embrace the changes you\u2019ll have as necessary for your baby to get the best head start. You can return to a smaller size after birth, but for now, you\u2019re growing someone. Someone you want the best for, and that requires sacrifices.\n\nI know it might be scary, and I\u2019m sorry for that. But you can do this. It\u2019s for them now, and they need you. \n\nCongratulations my dear.",
