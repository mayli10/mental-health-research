So the time comes when no one but me is in the house.  I opened the door and stumble my ass down to the kitchen.  I pretty much inhale 3 clementines, a chocolate bar, a piece of gum, some fish which was old and a cauliflower pizza.  I thought i was going to feel better but still felt like absolute death.  The smell of clementines on my finger tips almost made me throw up.  I broke down crying like 15 mins later.  I don't think it was because i ate it was more like what am i doing to myself.  life sucks major ass.",
