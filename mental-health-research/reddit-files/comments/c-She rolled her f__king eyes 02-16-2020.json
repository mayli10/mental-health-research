When I was in Uni I saw 5 or 6 different therapists before I found the one who really engaged with me, opened my eyes and genuinely wanted me to get better. Never felt rushed, or judged and I never left her office feeling worse than when I walked in. She was amazing and everything a therapist should be. \n\nThat was incredibly unprofessional of her and also will make it difficult for you to truly feel like you can open up and speak up.
