                "Text": "Lots of good responses on here already but I just wanna add she might have thought she was being nice. When non-ED people think \"anorexia\" they think of women that look like literal skeletons with faded grey skin from the documentaries, so they look super unhealthy (of course, because these are the most extreme examples that the documentaries could find to represent the disorder). She might think you look very thin but you still have nice skin, your hair might still be looking good, she might not have noticed any of the symptoms that typically accompany being underweight for prolonged periods of time (like the growth of additional downy body hair), so she might have been trying to reassure you that in spite of the disease, you're still a beautiful, healthy looking girl. \nEven if she was actually being a catty jackass, try to take it that way. It's not that you don't look sick and therefore are not sick, it's that you are beautiful in spite of being sick and will be even more beautiful and awesome and happy and confident once you enter recovery. :) ",
