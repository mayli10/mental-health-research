Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

I've given him flat out advice because I just don't care anymore and he gives me all these reasons why \"that just won't work\" (I explained low-cal volume eating to him). Apparently the reason I'm small is \"young age\" (despite being OW when I was younger). You can argue all day, but the truth is that they don't want to listen.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

                        "Text": "I don't expect anyone to be cured. I understand because I've been there and following CICO was what turned my binge eating disorder into EDNOS. So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

It's impossible to gain weight if you calorie restrict correctly.\n\n\nThe problem is people don't count properly. Many refuse to take in to account how much liquid calories add up or thinking that high volume food = automatically high calorie and vice versa.\n\nI can have a 120 calorie giant vegan bowl salad, or a 150 cal choco bar. Most people just look at the salad and think it totals more. ",

                            "Text": "Yea, I saw a video once where they had people pour out what they thought 1 serving of different foods and even though they explained how much a serving was, most still massively overestimated. Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

                        "Text": "I don't expect anyone to be cured. I understand because I've been there and following CICO was what turned my binge eating disorder into EDNOS. So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

It\u2019s fine to measure liquids by volume, but you\u2019d be amazed at how much the weight and volume of a serving doesn\u2019t line up. Luckily, those values are based off weight so the volume is meaningless anyway. ",

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

                        "Text": "I don't expect anyone to be cured. I understand because I've been there and following CICO was what turned my binge eating disorder into EDNOS. So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

It\u2019s fine to measure liquids by volume, but you\u2019d be amazed at how much the weight and volume of a serving doesn\u2019t line up.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

(nearly) Nothing that contradicts it can be true, but some things can be true alongside it, just to a lesser extent. \n\nKeto takes a lot of shit sometimes and rightfully so. For example, consuming 3000+ calories of low carb foods while not burning more calories will not result in weight loss. Now there is still legitimate science in the fact that eating a conventionally healthier diet (with protein and vegetables, etc etc) will give you better energy or preserve muscle, or that insulin and blood sugar regulation can affect your fat storage or hunger cues. However CICO is god, you can't get away with cheating the laws of physics. ",

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

I would love to do CICO again because it gives me a sense of control, but I just can't do it without bingeing. I'm losing weight through intuitive eating now, but obviously it's because I'm eating less Calories than I burn, but how do you not become ravenous then binge on CICO? It's as if I can never be satiated on it.",

                            "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

So yeah, the \u201ceat every 3 hours or you\u2019ll go into sTaRvATiON mOdE\u201d folks have got it twisted.\n\nWhen I was younger, just counting calories was enough to lose weight, but now that I\u2019m older (and have PCOS) I not only have to apply CICO, but also do Keto and intermittent fast 16-20 hours daily to lose.

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

                        "Text": "I don't expect anyone to be cured. I understand because I've been there and following CICO was what turned my binge eating disorder into EDNOS. So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

My eating isn't even too much of an ED most of the time. I am not underweight. I don't restrict unless I overate the previous day. I hate cardio, so yeah, not eating certain things IS how I stay fit. I will happily binge taco bell and those cinnabon things with them, but guys can't seem to understand I can't do that everyday and still look nice :( I honestly think if I mention it, they start imagining me when I used to be fat and they get scared lol.\n\nEdit: I am 5'2 and mostly sedentary if anyone is wondering. I really don't need that much food",

Hell, even my parents cooking I've the holidays stuck to my budget.\n\nY'all talking about alcohol and cocktails? Don't be like \"Oh, but you have room (space for fat) for a Rumchata/jello shots/ high cal beer/non diet soda mix.\" BITCH NO. I am this thin because I don't fall for that every time!\n\nI'll taste a fancy cocktail. One sip to know. Then go back to my vodka diet.

Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

                        "Text": "I\u2019d say in your case don\u2019t change your habits at first but track what you eat intuitively For a week so you can gage where you\u2019re at and have the proper data. At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

                        "Text": "Yea, I saw a video once where they had people pour out what they thought 1 serving of different foods and even though they explained how much a serving was, most still massively overestimated. Like pouring 1.5 cups of cereal and thinking it was half a cup or pouring out a quarter cup of olive oil for a tbsp. Ridiculous. I think the biggest key to weight loss (aside from being able to control yourself well enough to stay under your limit, which I know some people struggle with more than others, especially people with BED) is measuring everything (or better yet weighing everything) and counting every calorie, at least until you\u2019re used to what a serving size should look like and how much to eat in a day.

It\u2019s fine to measure liquids by volume, but you\u2019d be amazed at how much the weight and volume of a serving doesn\u2019t line up.

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",

                        "Text": "I don't expect anyone to be cured. I understand because I've been there and following CICO was what turned my binge eating disorder into EDNOS. So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

Because this encourages unhealthy habits that in the long term do not lead to maintained weight loss. \n\n\nFirst off, counting calories can encourage ED behavior. It encourages the person to eat lower and lower amounts. This obsession encourages the person to purge when they eat over what they think is too many calories as well as avoid foods that are VERY healthy for you but higher in calories (especially foods that are higher in protein.). The number game catches a lot of people and it caught me badly when I tried calorie counting. It encourages thought about food as not what is nutritious for you but rather what fits into your calorie count. \n\n\n\nThis is why many people with eating disorders have nutrient deficits that can even be life threatening. The sheer fact that it makes unhealthy foods seem okay because they fill your calorie budget is why CICO is not good diet advice. I'm sure many people have lost weight on CICO but how many long term (5-10 years long) have maintained that weight without engaging in unhealthy behaviors? This is why many doctors view calorie counting as disordered behavior.\n\n\n\nI'm sure this is going to be posted to fatlogic but this is all stuff my dietician has taught me.\n\n\n\nThe fact is, when you eat a healthy diet your hunger hormones will naturally make you feel more full and have less of an appetite. Hormones like insulin and ghrelin control your hunger and this is part of why so many people who restrict highly end up binging. This is why CICO is a failure and ends up in a restrict-binge cycle or an extreme restriction. \n\n\n\nLong term the diet may help you initially lose a lot of weight but it often has the consequences of worsening or developing an eating disorder. The diet may help people who are willing to eat a reasonable amount of calories and try not to lose weight so quickly.It shouldn't become a lifestyle because a lifestyle of counting calories is just torture.",

So I wanted to offer what my dietician has taught me and what helped me stop the purging and calorie counting. If I get downvoted for that then so be it.\n\nMaybe I should have been a little less harsh. I just see a lot of promoting of CICO without acknowledging how it can be harmful for people who are prone to eating disorders.\n\nI know what it is like to count calories obsessively and end up eating far below a healthy amount and then ending up with huge binges that I then purged. It was really rough. The worst thing is that I ended up gaining weight in the long run because of my behavior and that only made me feel worse. \n\nSo I want to do what the old sub did and help encourage mitigating of harm. If you want to eat low calorie amounts at least try to do things like eating nutrient dense food. I guarantee you will feel a lot better if you at least eat a good portion of fruits and vegetables as well as protein while eating in a very strong deficit.\n\nI know not everyone is ready for recovery but the goal should be to do as little harm as possible to your body while you engage in your disordered eating. \n\nI've been there and I want others to at least be harmed as little as possible.",

At that point I\u2019d say SLOWLY reduce and listen to your body. So say you\u2019re eating 1500 a day just normally maybe for a week try 1300 and make sure to get some high volume low cal food in see how you feel. If you can do that without a binge stay there for a week then try lowering further by small increments. If you find yourself binging one day, up it by 100 and stay in your safe no binge zone. Slow and steady sticks and if you can don\u2019t go below your TDEE for your goal weight. For us, 1200 is safe. That\u2019s healthy. \n\nI don\u2019t follow this advice sadly I\u2019m trying to go into maintenance (1200) soon. I\u2019m not a good model for this because I have AN and kind of enjoy a good bout of denying myself. I use coffee and benifiber to curb any huge cravings. Hot liquid is always a good deterrent I\u2019ll drink a big cup of tea or coffee and wait an hour if I still feel ravenous I will eat oatmeal. Oatmeal always gets me full and I don\u2019t feel too bad about an extra 100cals because over all I\u2019m still at a deficit. I am obsessed. I have no clue how not to be. But CICO is not to blame for that. For me CICO calms my panic because the numbers are right there the data is accurate and I actually find myself to be more accountable for what I\u2019m actually in taking instead of assuming everything is 1000 cals and calling it a day after an Apple. I\u2019m trying my very best to not hurt myself this time and I\u2019d never give advice for anyone to hurt themselves either. Although I know how this ED thing be. ",
