I can only think of 3 instances that family friends have commented on my weight, and those moments infuriate me and hurt so bad remembering them - I would have broken down long before you did. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with all of that, and I hope some change can come out of this. \n\nIt\u2019s almost funny how inconsistent these comments can be sometimes - my own mother, in the span of one day, bought me a large box of chocolates saying I\u2019d gotten too skinny and needed to fatten up, and later that day said I was eating way too many of them and was getting fat. (To be fair I did have like 5). But the thing is, although my weight fluctuates, whenever I\u2019m visiting home I\u2019ve been within the same 5 pound range for the last 5+ years. So I know logically that it\u2019s nonsensical, but I\u2019m still planning on wearing the sweater equivalent to a potato sack to all holiday parties so no one can say shit.",

(AYCE bbq too lmfaoooooo i hate my life) krn diet culture is the WORST but what kills me is that my older relatives will tell me that I'm fat and that I'll never find a boyfriend if I keep on eating BUT simultaneously asking me why I won't eat the food my grandma makes and that I must hate her if I don't eat and that picky girs don't get married (as if I care!) etc etc. \nI feel your last sentences bc I want to hurt myself as a way to punish these people who keep hurting me but I have to remember that the best way I can hurt them is to try to be as happy as possible and succeed without them ;___; We're all in this together sis sending you much love <3",

In the future they know that if they comment on your weight you magically become skinny (they definitely don't seem to understand your ED if they even know about it, and value a skinny daughter over a mentally and physically healthy one). You were on the path of recovery. That is something to be extremely proud of. I know this disease is so fucked, and the people in your life were horrible and completely out of line.

                "Text": "man I feel you, it seems like everyone in my family is constantly on some sort of diet, constantly praising each other on weightloss and being jealous over 12yo kids saying \u201cwhen I was your age I was even skinnier than you\u201d and shit like that. But when you stop eating there is something wrong with you and they just stop talking with you. One of my cousins was diagnosed with anorexia a few years ago, when she had to go to the hospital my whole family stopped talking to her. At the time I was still young so i couldn\u2019t do anything myself and I haven\u2019t talked to her since. Right my mother keeps saying how pretty i look and how much better i look when i\u2019m skinnier even though she has heard me purging in the bathroom multiple times. it\u2019s hard being a part of a culture that toxic, especially when they don\u2019t even realise it",

He used to have the classic body builder's body (shredded but muscular, abs, etc) then decided to switch over to powerlifting to gain some strength. He's still jacked, has big arms and legs, but has a little more fat on his body. He's not fat and is still stronger and fitter than the average person. People comment on his muscles to me all the time. He looks amazing. However, his parents have told him they preferred when he was cut rather than \"how fat he is now.\" We once went to a family reunion and he hadn't seen most of his aunt's and uncles in a few years. I heard multiple people use the word \"fat\" towards him or grab his belly. I was horrified but he just shrugged it off. I would never be able to survive in that culture and you don't deserve that at all. I hope this doesn't send you into a spiral and you are able to continue recovery, because despite the unsolicited opinions of everybody in your life, that is what is important.",

They\u2019re an older generation, they can\u2019t understand, they probably think it\u2019s love, but they don\u2019t hate you, nor want you to hurt yourself. At least we can learn from their older generation bullshit of eat/don\u2019t eat shenanigan to teach future kids that fat shaming is mean even if it\u2019s within family. \n\nI\u2019ve been on this boat, I\u2019m a senior in college now and I started working out two years ago. I am now close to being back to my before freshman 15+ weight. I started going to the gym not because they kept telling me I was fat, but because I was no longer confident in myself because of their unfiltered comments. Feel more confident in your body, you only have one. Getting a personal trainer is expensive but it\u2019s worth getting some confidence at the gym. I would 100% recommend it and get revenge by bettering yourself. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this was too cheesy or if you didn\u2019t need to hear this positivity shit.",
