But i was so frustrated that in the end I gained weight to 115lbs... But when I looked back at photos of myself with 94-95lbs, I saw a slim figure and just wished I'd stayed that weight. Now I am 101lbs and slowly trying to reach 95lbs again, but even though I see that I lose weight, I'm (again!!) not happy with my body and won't be at my goal weight. It's ridiculous  \nThis downward spiral just sucks and I feel you.",
