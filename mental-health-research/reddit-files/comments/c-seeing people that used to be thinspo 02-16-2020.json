(Male and female)  The ones that are curvy with no definition (more common on females) are not.  The ones that are walking skeletons with no muscle at all I feel sorry for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I also draw a line an how I feel.  Two days ago I was constantly hungry and tired.

Slim, but not always skinny.\n\nI often wonder whether I actually have distorted body image when I look in the mirror or whether what I see is reflective of reality (no pun intended) and I just have a different idea of what thin would look like (realistically it's probably both, because I know I see myself as bigger than people who are the same size, but also I don't see people my actual size as being thin either)\n\nLike how can I have a \"thigh gap\" and still think my thighs look huge? Granted, I have wide hips and get a thing gap at a BMI of like 20-21\n\nLike even when I see pics of thin celebrities in form fitting outfits I can't help but notice if their stomach isn't completely flat (which is pretty much always, because a completely flat stomach is definitely not normal or healthy)",
