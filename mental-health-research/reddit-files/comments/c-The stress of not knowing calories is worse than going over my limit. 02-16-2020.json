I was restricting all day today and most of yesterday, but then my mum had made this chicken pasta bake and offered me some and I couldn't resist. I had a small portion and I did weigh it quickly, but have no clue of the specific ingredients and measurements used, so I can't use an accurate number.\n\nI'm still stressing about it and planning to a 150 calorie day tomorrow to make up for it (I thought about fasting but I think that will lead to e eating more than if I allow myself a small meal).\n\nAnyway, I really feel this post lol.",
