I'm too scared to even weigh myself right now but my sister told me how amazing I look on Christmas and well....she's into the Kim Kardash big booty look so    :/\n\nI don't even hate what I look like too much (I mean, I don't like it, but I don't hate either) but it's SO uncomfortable.

Still thin, but healthy and my mind wasn't completely consumed by the ED. This was the best time. \n\n\nBut then some shit happened that disrupted my normal eating patters and even sleeping patterns, and thus fucked my hunger cues. So now I feel weirdly hungry at inappropriate times and often. And I gained a lot of weight. \n\n\nSo I am trying to force myself to be good at restriction again, but it's so much harder now. I actually get hungry when I didn't before. I feel faint. I get weak. Part of me wished I had never stopped. ",

I've been in a horrific binge/restrict/overexercise cycle for A YEAR now.  I'm too scared to even weigh myself right now but my sister told me how amazing I look on Christmas and well....she's into the Kim Kardash big booty look so    :/\n\nI don't even hate what I look like too much (I mean, I don't like it, but I don't hate either) but it's SO uncomfortable. I feel foreign in my own skin rn.",
