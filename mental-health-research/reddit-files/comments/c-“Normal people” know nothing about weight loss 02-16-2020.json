Im always wondering if people believe that darkness or laying down means you're going to gain weight, or theres some inherent circadian rhythm humans have in response to darkness?  I guess that means people in Alaska during the winter are completely fucked, and gain all winter, or if you travel around the world then the opposite is true because your body doesnt know its in a different timezone, so better eat all your calories at night!",

If I had to eat a low carb diet, that would require me to cut out most foods I eat lol.. including 'healthy' stuff like oatmeal, fruit and veggies.\n\nAnd in regards to the water weight loss, yeah its almost a way to trick people into thinking they are losing more weight than they actually are. Then they introduce carby foods back and suddenly their weight shoots back up due to the water.",

It's just easier for me to restrict in morning/afternoon and eat 1 big meal in the evening. But i used to \"do\" OMAD but jinge eat 3000+kcal with pizza etc and not eat all day at work before it, and guess what, gained 20kg in a year.

If I had to eat a low carb diet, that would require me to cut out most foods I eat lol.. including 'healthy' stuff like oatmeal, fruit and veggies.\n\nAnd in regards to the water weight loss, yeah its almost a way to trick people into thinking they are losing more weight than they actually are. Then they introduce carby foods back and suddenly their weight shoots back up due to the water.",

If you legitimately benefit from keto because of your health or eating habits, go for it. Keto or similar diets have been helpful for many of my students with seizure disorders actually. I definitely didn\u2019t intend to insult people who follow and benefit from Keto. It\u2019s more like the trendy aspect of it. Like CrossFit. CrossFit sounds super effective as a fitness approach (I can\u2019t afford the brand name but have done similar things and it\u2019s HARD)... but it\u2019s annoying when you can\u2019t talk about anything other than CrossFit.

We got a spiralizer for our wedding so I\u2019m excited to use that\u2014 we are waiting till we move to get our gifts though bc we have no space right now. Barilla also makes several veggie pasta types and I\u2019ve enjoyed a few of those (I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re keto friendly because it\u2019s a traditional pasta company, but I liked them!)",

It's definitely a tad bit softer on the bite but honestly so worth the trade-off and taste buds adapt so quickly in humans haha.\n\nUnfortunately they're not keto friendly, but still a good alternative to regular pasta!\n\nI've tried spiralized veggie noodles but just not the same :(",

So yeah, OMAD is nothing without overall calorie restriction.",

I've tried some of the alternatives like Banza or kelp noodles (or even shirataki which is technically plant based becase it's from a yam root) but I never really liked most of them for taste or texture reasons.\n\nside note: a friend and I got really tired of the existing low carb pasta / noodle options and we decided to spend a year in our own kitchens formulating a [keto-friendly instant ramen noodle](https://www.immieats.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=EDAnonymous%20-%20%E2%80%9CNormal%20people%E2%80%9D%20know%20nothing%20about%20weight%20loss) which has the same texture and taste as noodles we grew up eating. not launching until next year but definitely a good option as a plant-based noodle!

If you legitimately benefit from keto because of your health or eating habits, go for it. Keto or similar diets have been helpful for many of my students with seizure disorders actually. I definitely didn\u2019t intend to insult people who follow and benefit from Keto. It\u2019s more like the trendy aspect of it. Like CrossFit. CrossFit sounds super effective as a fitness approach (I can\u2019t afford the brand name but have done similar things and it\u2019s HARD)... but it\u2019s annoying when you can\u2019t talk about anything other than CrossFit.

But i used to \"do\" OMAD but jinge eat 3000+kcal with pizza etc and not eat all day at work before it, and guess what, gained 20kg in a year. So yeah, OMAD is nothing without overall calorie restriction.",

But this is because I have ADHD and am susceptible to crashing if I eat them too early in the day. I do appreciate all the diet foods that came from demonizing carbs though. Plant based pasta is my favorite invention ever because I missed pasta so much (such an unsafe food for me).",

I've tried some of the alternatives like Banza or kelp noodles (or even shirataki which is technically plant based becase it's from a yam root) but I never really liked most of them for taste or texture reasons.\n\nside note: a friend and I got really tired of the existing low carb pasta / noodle options and we decided to spend a year in our own kitchens formulating a [keto-friendly instant ramen noodle](https://www.immieats.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=EDAnonymous%20-%20%E2%80%9CNormal%20people%E2%80%9D%20know%20nothing%20about%20weight%20loss) which has the same texture and taste as noodles we grew up eating. not launching until next year but definitely a good option as a plant-based noodle!

But this is because I have ADHD and am susceptible to crashing if I eat them too early in the day. I do appreciate all the diet foods that came from demonizing carbs though. Plant based pasta is my favorite invention ever because I missed pasta so much (such an unsafe food for me).",

I've tried some of the alternatives like Banza or kelp noodles (or even shirataki which is technically plant based becase it's from a yam root) but I never really liked most of them for taste or texture reasons.\n\nside note: a friend and I got really tired of the existing low carb pasta / noodle options and we decided to spend a year in our own kitchens formulating a [keto-friendly instant ramen noodle](https://www.immieats.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=EDAnonymous%20-%20%E2%80%9CNormal%20people%E2%80%9D%20know%20nothing%20about%20weight%20loss) which has the same texture and taste as noodles we grew up eating. not launching until next year but definitely a good option as a plant-based noodle!

If you legitimately benefit from keto because of your health or eating habits, go for it. Keto or similar diets have been helpful for many of my students with seizure disorders actually.

CrossFit sounds super effective as a fitness approach (I can\u2019t afford the brand name but have done similar things and it\u2019s HARD)... but it\u2019s annoying when you can\u2019t talk about anything other than CrossFit.

It's definitely a tad bit softer on the bite but honestly so worth the trade-off and taste buds adapt so quickly in humans haha.\n\nUnfortunately they're not keto friendly, but still a good alternative to regular pasta!\n\nI've tried spiralized veggie noodles but just not the same :(",

But again, it's literally CICO, since I burn 1600-2000 calories a day and eat 300-700 calories when dieting. It's just easier for me to restrict in morning/afternoon and eat 1 big meal in the evening. But i used to \"do\" OMAD but jinge eat 3000+kcal with pizza etc and not eat all day at work before it, and guess what, gained 20kg in a year.

If you legitimately benefit from keto because of your health or eating habits, go for it. Keto or similar diets have been helpful for many of my students with seizure disorders actually. I definitely didn\u2019t intend to insult people who follow and benefit from Keto. It\u2019s more like the trendy aspect of it. Like CrossFit. CrossFit sounds super effective as a fitness approach (I can\u2019t afford the brand name but have done similar things and it\u2019s HARD)... but it\u2019s annoying when you can\u2019t talk about anything other than CrossFit. I hope that makes sense.",

I've tried some of the alternatives like Banza or kelp noodles (or even shirataki which is technically plant based becase it's from a yam root) but I never really liked most of them for taste or texture reasons.\n\nside note: a friend and I got really tired of the existing low carb pasta / noodle options and we decided to spend a year in our own kitchens formulating a [keto-friendly instant ramen noodle](https://www.immieats.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=comment&utm_campaign=EDAnonymous%20-%20%E2%80%9CNormal%20people%E2%80%9D%20know%20nothing%20about%20weight%20loss) which has the same texture and taste as noodles we grew up eating. not launching until next year but definitely a good option as a plant-based noodle!

No, you don't stop losing weight, unless you are eating too many calories/not burning enough with physical activity. That's that.

Barilla also makes several veggie pasta types and I\u2019ve enjoyed a few of those (I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re keto friendly because it\u2019s a traditional pasta company, but I liked them!)",

But again, it's literally CICO, since I burn 1600-2000 calories a day and eat 300-700 calories when dieting. It's just easier for me to restrict in morning/afternoon and eat 1 big meal in the evening. But i used to \"do\" OMAD but jinge eat 3000+kcal with pizza etc and not eat all day at work before it, and guess what, gained 20kg in a year. So yeah, OMAD is nothing without overall calorie restriction.",

If you legitimately benefit from keto because of your health or eating habits, go for it. Keto or similar diets have been helpful for many of my students with seizure disorders actually.

CrossFit sounds super effective as a fitness approach (I can\u2019t afford the brand name but have done similar things and it\u2019s HARD)... but it\u2019s annoying when you can\u2019t talk about anything other than CrossFit.
