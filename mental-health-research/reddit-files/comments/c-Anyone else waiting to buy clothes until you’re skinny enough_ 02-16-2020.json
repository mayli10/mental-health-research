Most of my clothes are too loose now, but I can't bring myself to buy new ones, because I feel like that would be a way of rewarding myself for having an ED, I worry that I'll gain all the weight back and the clothes will become too small, I think I don't deserve to spend the money, and I worry that I'll become addicted to shopping, because I don't trust myself to do anything in moderation anymore. I only replaced my underwear, because they were literally falling off. Aside from that, the only things I'm comfortable with buying are men's t-shirts and oversized hoodies. Everything else causes guilt. I wish I could go on an online shopping spree and buy all the things I would have wanted as a teenager if I had known about cheap eBay/Chinese stores.\n\nI recommend buying the clothes at your current size, because there's no guarantee that you'll feel more comfortable buying clothes at a smaller size. You might get stuck in a no-shopping trap like me.",

At least in my experience, it would have helped me go out, have a life, keep my friends, etc instead of becoming completely consumed with eating and hiding. Also it makes you feel better about yourself (trust me, even if you don't think it's \"working\") and even that slightest relief from feeling completely disgusting can translate to a huge difference in how you carry yourself, treat yourself, and your overall mindset.\n\nI still am super fucked up re: food, but I binge SO much less now (like maybe 2x a month instead of every day) and feel less helpless to my inner food monster. I've been bingeing for 6 years, and I only made that progress in the past 10 months, and I think the biggest reason I finally did improve is because I drastically increased the amount of time I spent in public/around other people... which forced me to have to dress at least okay enough for being in public, rather than sweats and ratty t-shirts 24/7",
