Even when they're engaging with each other in an antisocial slapfight that resembles human speech unless you grade for content. My money's down on bots scripted by petty chaos demons.\n\nYou could post a video of a puppy playing with a soccer ball, and end up with a comment section full of...idk, whether we should universally imprison everyone from Florida?\n\nSelf-care is leaving sentient cum to do its thing. Happy, sexy people don't try to compete with OP to gas themselves up in the comment sections on youtube videos about eating disorders. If they start that fight, they've already lost.\n\nI like to pretend we don't share a planet with them. If you want to come into my pillow fort of awkward denial, I'll pour the drinks. \ud83e\udd37",
