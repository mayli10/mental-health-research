If you are obese or overweight (not underweight) I think it's perfectly healthy to practice some low restriction or fasting, because odds are your hunger hormones are overproducing and you don't need the amount of food that your body is telling you you do.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

While there is rampent diet culture and loads of easily available diet aides, there's also a wicked convenience food and take out food culture and just hella available junk good everywhere. Like where I like I have 3 bakeries, 5 convenience stores, a burger King, McDonald's, subways and 3 pizza places in short walking distance, not to mention the cafes and the super cheap Korean food places around me. and if I want pretty much any food delivered to me at any time its really easy to do so. I binged a Lot living here, dipping in and out of restrictions and purging. Though I will say that going into restrictions is easy because things like konjac/shiritaki products are easy to come across lol. ",

If you are obese or overweight (not underweight) I think it's perfectly healthy to practice some low restriction or fasting, because odds are your hunger hormones are overproducing and you don't need the amount of food that your body is telling you you do.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

It's crazy how eating disordered most of these women sound, although to be fair the weights they mention aren't outrageously low.

For me that's a BMI of 16.5, which is actually my ideal atm (it's about as low as I can go before I start feeling weak, but using that rule, the shorter you are, the lower your 'ideal' BMI is (eg. if you're 5'3, that's a BMI of 15.6, but if you're 5'9 it's 17.9)",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

If you are obese or overweight (not underweight) I think it's perfectly healthy to practice some low restriction or fasting, because odds are your hunger hormones are overproducing and you don't need the amount of food that your body is telling you you do.",

It's like, he may be feeling hungry, but that's probably (?) caused by overeating in the first place, which also causes you to lose the knowledge of when you're truly full.

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

Like where I like I have 3 bakeries, 5 convenience stores, a burger King, McDonald's, subways and 3 pizza places in short walking distance, not to mention the cafes and the super cheap Korean food places around me. and if I want pretty much any food delivered to me at any time its really easy to do so. I binged a Lot living here, dipping in and out of restrictions and purging. Though I will say that going into restrictions is easy because things like konjac/shiritaki products are easy to come across lol. ",

                "Text": "I lived in China for three years and yes, what you say is actually really true. I will tell you two stories that will even increase your wild idea of it. \n\nI had a flatmate, a girl who was working with me at a night club.  She was not fat, not overweight, actually in the low-normal range. She would go weeks with eating only watermelon because she wanted to look skinnier. I'm not exaggerating, she would buy like 3 or 4 watermelons a week and that would be all her meals.\n\nSecond story, still with the same girl. At some point, I fell pretty sick for around a month and had to be hospitalized. During that time I lost A LOT of weight and went from 51 to 44kg (for 165cm so i was already in the almost underweight range). The exact day we went to the hospital, she kept telling me how I look great and how she is jealous that I lost a bunch of weight. I kept reminding her that I couldn't eat for a month and fainted twice on the bus... ",

When you do hear about this stuff, like for example those women's magazines from Japan where they publish before and after pictures (and in the before picture the woman was what we consider 'chubby' at most and in the after picture they clearly look like what we would consider a malnourished body) it's some small article on some Western magazine's website when they didn't know what else to write about. \n\nOr K-Pop stars who share their 'diets' which pretty much come down to not eating anything except for a Starbucks Latte with low fat foam.\n\nOn one hand, it kind of irks me that apparently nobody in those countries ever speaks about this stuff but that it's pretty much seen as an ideal and everyone just accepts it as it is and how oppressive it is and how much pressure they - and especially Korea - put on their women to be some kind of perfect entity. On the other hand sometimes I think it would be kind of nice to live in a social culture where men not only know that you eat too little, but almost expect you to, as opposed to the Western World where the ideal is often very close to the 'Cool Girl' where men think we can stuff our faces with junk every day and remain a size 2...",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

They only highlight the healthy aspects of course (readily available fruits and vegetables) but never address the EDs. All of their beauty standards are just messed up in general. They advocate use of whitening creams without a care of what's in them.\n\nAnd the craziest part are the families. Your Asian aunties make fun of you to your face when you gain weight but then nag you to eat more of their dishes. Wtf is that about?? ",

If you are obese or overweight (not underweight) I think it's perfectly healthy to practice some low restriction or fasting, because odds are your hunger hormones are overproducing and you don't need the amount of food that your body is telling you you do.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

The lady in the pink coat saying 'or you just starve yourself' more literally said 'Or you just really don't eat.'\n\nKorea has a lot of extreme diets and not a whole lot of awareness for mental health issues and eating disordered. You'll have the apple diet, or the paper cup diet (a portion control thing, some do it so that the elements of your meal have to fit in the paper cup which isn't so bad, others do it that the whole meal fits in the paper cup which is awful), you'll have celebrities casually talk about going in extended fasts or only eating 2 pouches of baby food a day or whatever else or even talking about forcing themselves to vomit is they overate or broke their diet and being in total denial that behaviours like that are a problem.\n\nIt's changing as some idols discuss having eating disorders and getting treatment. Like IU talked about having bulimia, as did Seo In-Guk, Ashley from Ladies Code got treatment for Anorexia and seemly recovered okay while Jin-E was diagnosed with anorexia, received treatment, relapsed and eventually left Oh My Girl because her recovery was going very badly, rather publicly and with their company clearly taking the illness very seriously. It's starting to be talked about.\n\nBut there is a social understanding that fat people are ... unhealthy, have let themselves go, are unattractive or lazy or weak-willed and the people around you; family, friends, co-workers, will be very glib if you are overweight and will tell you in you gain weight. It's kind of seen as a social responsibility. If a friend has gained too much weight and is looking fat, you talk to them about it and urge them to diet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: I'm not Korean, I've just lived here for 5 years so this is my understanding through observation. I might not be totally correct.",

The volume he eats routinely baffles me! \n\nI'm gonna make him fast with me and hopefully both of our stomachs will go to factory reset, lol!",

While there is rampent diet culture and loads of easily available diet aides, there's also a wicked convenience food and take out food culture and just hella available junk good everywhere. Like where I like I have 3 bakeries, 5 convenience stores, a burger King, McDonald's, subways and 3 pizza places in short walking distance, not to mention the cafes and the super cheap Korean food places around me. and if I want pretty much any food delivered to me at any time its really easy to do so. I binged a Lot living here, dipping in and out of restrictions and purging. Though I will say that going into restrictions is easy because things like konjac/shiritaki products are easy to come across lol. ",
