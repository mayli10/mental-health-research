                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

                        "Text": "I completely understand being too anxious to sleep- that\u2019s me literally every day and I\u2019m so sorry that you are dealing with it too. If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                            "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

Its great for dipping fruit or just eating out of the tub and isn't insanely calorie dense. I was skeptical but the texture and taste are *fantastic*.",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

                        "Text": "I completely understand being too anxious to sleep- that\u2019s me literally every day and I\u2019m so sorry that you are dealing with it too. If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you.

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you.

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

                        "Text": "I completely understand being too anxious to sleep- that\u2019s me literally every day and I\u2019m so sorry that you are dealing with it too. If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you.

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

                        "Text": "I completely understand being too anxious to sleep- that\u2019s me literally every day and I\u2019m so sorry that you are dealing with it too. If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you.

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                        "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you. And if you want me to give you any more info about how I made a routine or whatever just ask :)",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",

                            "Text": "I realize that. I was just sharing what helped me. I\u2019m in CBT therapy now, and once I was able to reduce the purge urges, intuitive eating helped me navigate the binging part of my disorder. \n\nIt takes the drama, anxiety, and stress away from food by rejecting the diet mentality. Maybe some people aren\u2019t ready for that, but I was just sharing what helped me break my cycle.\n\nIf you want practical tips, here\u2019s a few:\n1. When you feel the urge to binge, write down how you feel. If you act on it, force yourself to write down how you feel during it. Afterwards, record how you feel now. \n\nLook at what you wrote. Were you really hungry, or trying to satiate a different need of yours? Maybe loneliness? Sadness? A lot of times we eat to fill a void in us, and we never end up satisfying it. Maybe you were hungry. But if you were sad, or anxious, you should allow yourself to sit with the discomfort of feeling without turning to food. It\u2019s ok to feel.\n\n2. Wait before you act. When I started, I could only wait maybe 30 seconds before binging. Time yourself to see how long you can wait before doing it. Even if you still binge, that\u2019s okay. You waited longer than if you had acted on impulse. Over time, the time will increase, maybe 5 minutes. Maybe an hour. And with time, the feelings fade a little. A brief spurt of anger or sadness is more like a blip in your day than something that completely dismantles it and forces you into a binge.\n\n3. Find a different coping mechanism. Whenever the overwhelming urge to act on it occurs, do something to positively manage the stress. Mine is walking my dog or meditating. \n\n4. Honoring my body. Intuitive eating, as I mentioned before, played a huge role. Being able to listen to others talk negatively about their bodies or about their diets and not spiral about my own. Not counting because I don\u2019t have to. Listening to when my body wants food, what exactly it wants, and when it\u2019s had enough. So often I would settle for the diet/skinny option of what I truly wanted, and I was never satisfied with food. When I listen to my cravings and honor them, I eat the food I want and am satisfied enough to not binge.",

If it\u2019s bothering you that much I would honestly talk to your doctor (if you have insurance/ one available). Whether you can discuss meds with your doctor or not I would also establish a bedtime routine that you can do every night to kind of pamper yourself and make going to bed feel safer for you. (After all sleep is amazing and you deserve to have some <3!) Over the counter sleep aids help for a bit but it\u2019s easy to build a tolerance to them over time and 99% of them have the same active ingredient (Diphenhydramine). I don\u2019t have insurance right now so I\u2019m self medicating with pot to help me sleep for now but honestly my bedtime routine helps a LOT even without pot. \n\nI absolutely advise you to do your own research and fact check me as I am just a human on the internet speaking from experience and my own research  \u2764\ufe0f but I hope that at least some of what I said can be helpful to you.

It calms down the brain immediately. Look for l'theanine powder on Amazon. I buy it from the bulk supplements company. Hope this helps. Take good care\u2665\ufe0f",

                        "Text": "Okay so first of all, I try REALLY hard to not be in my bedroom too much duri(ng the day/evening when I\u2019m home from work. If you\u2019re in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that\u2019s for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I\u2019m already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn\u2019t use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:\n\n-get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you\u2019ve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)\n\n-smoke with BF when he comes home\n\n-eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm\n\n-watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy\n\n-at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I\u2019ll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep. \n\nI structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep. \n\nI honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don\u2019t get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax! \n\nI would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you\u2019re an awesome human who deserves all the good things. \n\nAnd tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime. \n\nPM me if you want any more info or if you\u2019d like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that\u2019s a whole other thing. \u2764\ufe0f I hope this helps!",
