I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I come from an abusive household, and as I got older realised my parents had a lot of unresolved trauma and problems they didn't deal with adequately and so did their parents before them. My mum stays oblivious to save her own feelings and my dad drank himself to his grave.\n\nFeel it definitely but don't let it eat you up inside. Take yourself away from the situation if you need to and seek therapy if you struggle but don't let yourself live in turmoil and continue the cycle.",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",

I've spent years trying to undo the propaganda that's been fed to me--I grew up being told that my ancestors were dairy farmers and that I should eat lots of cheese to \"prevent osteoporosis.\"  Unlearning all of that definitely took me a long time. \n In case you're interested in learning more, I like \"Forks Over Knives\" on Netflix and \"Earthlings,\" available on youtube and narrated by Joaquin Phoenix. I also like \"Dairy is Scary\" on youtube, a 5 minute video on the dairy industry.  Dr. Neal Barnard has a lecture on youtube called \"The Cheese Trap\" which is also very interesting.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHyLV3jeifk (He also has a book by the same name.)",
