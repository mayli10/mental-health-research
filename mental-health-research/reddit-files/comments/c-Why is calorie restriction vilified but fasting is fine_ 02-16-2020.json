I wonder what the randoms there would say if they knew how much her mom's cried for her already.\n\nProbably the exact same rationalizations and horseshit, just really defensively if they're the ones who clearly know (yet refuse to admit) that they're in the same picture + don't like it.\n\nKeep an eye out for the people with BED who claim it's all about medical treatment to solve their overeating, but display obvious repeating feast/famine cycles. Finish your drink when they frame their appetite and habits as \"successful fast vs failed fast\" rather than two symbiotic sides of the same leptin-fucked coin.\n\nThey've put blood and sweat into learning how to juggle knives and look unfazed. After that, of *course* it's easier to bury your hands in your pockets and go \"not my fault if you cut yourself knife-juggling; knife-juggling's safe, so it must be an issue of personal weakness (that I can feel comfortably exempt from) if it hurts you, loser\" than it is to admit that *maybe we shouldn't juggle knives.*\n\nNVM, let's all bury our heads in the sand and pretend it's not a glorified fad diet (at best) to skip meals and call it a lifestyle. We can still get away with just putting a disclaimer in the sidebar, fingers to our lips, winking at Reddit admins, and going \"shhhh\".\n\nWhy fix ~~what isn't broken?~~ what's broken but hasn't gotten negative off-site PR yet from suburban parents who buy stock?",

My parents own a weight loss clinic and through that I've seen people really have a hard time with mentally accepting permanent life changes. \"Diets\" fail because, once you stop the diet/restricting, your weight goes back up.

They don't have to face their daily lack of self control because they're running small sprints. It's more planned, so they feel better about the nutrients as well.

                "Text": "Well. I have actually the complete opposite experience, because where I come from fasting is not something anyone does or want to do (if you are not in a spiritual retreat) but everyone is on a diet, almost all the time\n\nBut if I try to think it from their perspective. Calorie restriction is usually a long term thing, like for months, while a fast is max 3 days a year. Plus research have found that fasting (up to 3 days max) has some benefits, adding to that many people have spiritual/ritualistic views of fasting as a \"cleanse\" or \"detox\" or a \"sign of will power and spiritual strength\" and not just for weight loss.  \nBut here comes misinformation, because you can still meet your nutrients while restricting, which is not bad for health.",

With fasting you're supposed to eat back the calories so you still should not be less than 1200 a day.

Even if the kid agreed to it. Which says a lot to me about how actually \"healthy\" we all know this is, deep down.\n\nKeto for kids? Sure. Paleo? Sure. Vegan? It can work, though you see some get upset about that too when it's perceived as restrictive.\n\nFasting for kids? Funny, you somehow never hear about that, despite its often-lauded health benefits - and when you do, the story ends with \"and then I called CPS because I'm a mandated reporter\".",
