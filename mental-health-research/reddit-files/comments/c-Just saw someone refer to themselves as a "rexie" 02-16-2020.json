Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

                        "Text": "I mean, I get the critique of it being triggering.\n\nBut.....why are ED movies obligated to act as PSAs? We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

                            "Text": "Same. I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

                            "Text": "well i agree with you about the triggers but i do think it appeals to the portion of people with EDs who have that desire to be cared for. i know that\u2019s not all of us, but i can personally attest to wanting to be sick enough to be worried about as a teen. my ED has evolved past that now and i\u2019m old enough that it wouldn\u2019t push me back to trying to be Forever The Sickest Kid but if it had come out when i was in high school i probably would have longed to have everyone worry about me so much, even though it\u2019s not like it really makes it look fun. \n\nat the end of the day, though, i think our disorders can twist all kinds of horrible shit to seem desirable, so though i\u2019m not a fan of to the bone myself i am inclined to not be quite so hard on it about that in particular because let\u2019s face it my ED brain will find a way to find SOMETHING in any type of ED media aspirational and it\u2019s really not necessarily their fault.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

                            "Text": "well i agree with you about the triggers but i do think it appeals to the portion of people with EDs who have that desire to be cared for. i know that\u2019s not all of us, but i can personally attest to wanting to be sick enough to be worried about as a teen. my ED has evolved past that now and i\u2019m old enough that it wouldn\u2019t push me back to trying to be Forever The Sickest Kid but if it had come out when i was in high school i probably would have longed to have everyone worry about me so much, even though it\u2019s not like it really makes it look fun. \n\nat the end of the day, though, i think our disorders can twist all kinds of horrible shit to seem desirable, so though i\u2019m not a fan of to the bone myself i am inclined to not be quite so hard on it about that in particular because let\u2019s face it my ED brain will find a way to find SOMETHING in any type of ED media aspirational and it\u2019s really not necessarily their fault.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

If someone had an eating disorder and was trying to recover, and decided to watch that to feel less alone about their struggles, it might just tear down what they worked really hard to build for themselves. I watch that movie specifically when I want to feel invalid and work harder to be skinny. By the end, it seems pro-recovery, but that's not without showing her emaciated body on the ground, and everyone in the world scrambling around feeling scared for her. It's like every anorexic's wet dream. I like the movie, personally, but I completely understand why a lot of people don't.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

                        "Text": "I mean, I get the critique of it being triggering.\n\nBut.....why are ED movies obligated to act as PSAs? We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

                            "Text": "Same. I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

                            "Text": "well i agree with you about the triggers but i do think it appeals to the portion of people with EDs who have that desire to be cared for. i know that\u2019s not all of us, but i can personally attest to wanting to be sick enough to be worried about as a teen. my ED has evolved past that now and i\u2019m old enough that it wouldn\u2019t push me back to trying to be Forever The Sickest Kid but if it had come out when i was in high school i probably would have longed to have everyone worry about me so much, even though it\u2019s not like it really makes it look fun. \n\nat the end of the day, though, i think our disorders can twist all kinds of horrible shit to seem desirable, so though i\u2019m not a fan of to the bone myself i am inclined to not be quite so hard on it about that in particular because let\u2019s face it my ED brain will find a way to find SOMETHING in any type of ED media aspirational and it\u2019s really not necessarily their fault.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

                            "Text": "well i agree with you about the triggers but i do think it appeals to the portion of people with EDs who have that desire to be cared for. i know that\u2019s not all of us, but i can personally attest to wanting to be sick enough to be worried about as a teen. my ED has evolved past that now and i\u2019m old enough that it wouldn\u2019t push me back to trying to be Forever The Sickest Kid but if it had come out when i was in high school i probably would have longed to have everyone worry about me so much, even though it\u2019s not like it really makes it look fun. \n\nat the end of the day, though, i think our disorders can twist all kinds of horrible shit to seem desirable, so though i\u2019m not a fan of to the bone myself i am inclined to not be quite so hard on it about that in particular because let\u2019s face it my ED brain will find a way to find SOMETHING in any type of ED media aspirational and it\u2019s really not necessarily their fault.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

If someone had an eating disorder and was trying to recover, and decided to watch that to feel less alone about their struggles, it might just tear down what they worked really hard to build for themselves. I watch that movie specifically when I want to feel invalid and work harder to be skinny. By the end, it seems pro-recovery, but that's not without showing her emaciated body on the ground, and everyone in the world scrambling around feeling scared for her. It's like every anorexic's wet dream. I like the movie, personally, but I completely understand why a lot of people don't.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

For me this, along with a childhood history of obesity & uncontrollable eating, causes my AN to  have strong roots not only in feeling in control but making me feel successful and accomplished.\n\nSomething as dramatic as that happening *in public* and everyone fussing over me would kinda display to everyone who sees that I\u2019m faking being put together, I can\u2019t take care myself or handle anything, Etc.",

The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

                        "Text": "I mean, I get the critique of it being triggering.\n\nBut.....why are ED movies obligated to act as PSAs? We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD.

Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content.

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them.

I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves.

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots.

Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter?

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

                        "Text": "I mean, I get the critique of it being triggering.\n\nBut.....why are ED movies obligated to act as PSAs? We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

                            "Text": "Same. I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter?

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

                "Text": "**Single Post because I don\u2019t want to directly reply to anyone in particular and I also just wanna comment on the original post all at once #lazy**\n\n***\n\n1.Rexie is definitely much older than \u201cAna\u201d & \u201cMia\u201d used conversationally. It\u2019s not a born out of tumblr word or close. I didn\u2019t see, \u201cto the bone\u201d but they didn\u2019t invent the name so we could have a quirky thing \u2014it\u2019s been around (on the web) since before 2004 and off the web it was used before that it seems. Just like *every* other slang term it can fall out of relevance and sometimes make a come back. RAD! SIKE! \n\n**\n\n2.Could be wrong but don\u2019t think it was ever used as a personification. My friend non ironically & non jokingly  called me an \u201cAlchie\u201d for awhile before I got sober. Rexie sounds to be in similar vein. alchie = lazy shortening or alcoholic,  rexie = lazy shortening or anorexic. \n\nBtw Trust me, she wasn\u2019t \u2018romanticizing\u2019. She was saying I \u201cneed to admit I\u2019m a fucking Alchie because drinking alone everyday isn\u2019t normal.\u201d!*FYI: calling  someone a \u201calkie\u201d/\u201calky\u201d/\u201calchy\u201d is well understood to be an insult in a lot of places, can be used just to tease someone, but yeah *\n\n***\n\n3.Im not sanctimonious guys, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve liked making fun of the silliness of the personification thing in the past and probably will still poke fun at it in the future sometimes. ***However*** i don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to make people out to be odd/juvenile/complacent/ \u201cglorifying\u201d/\u201cromanticizing\u201d just because someone jumped on the bandwagon of using \u201cAna\u201d to personify ED on and off, or sometimes using \u201cRexie\u201d to euphemize their diagnosis sometimes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\n4.TBH I kinda the appeal especially in humorous convo.  I\u2019ve been battling EDs on and off for over a decade & AN specifically on and off for >5 years so why not have a sense of humor about it when among people with similar struggles?\n\n***\n\n5.Its silly for sure but i can\u2019t think of it as unique, quirky, unusually, or stupid. Thats probably because I live since in a society where both teens & adults who aren\u2019t even dealers say things like:\n\n \u201cThe best weekend is always one with Mary Jane\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Molly makes me wanna dance\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re broke to spend the evening with Jack\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably gonna fail without Addy helping me study\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kinda too afraid to take a trip with Lucy things might go bad\u201d\n\n\u201c Dex/Drex/D just makes you act like an idiot dude, I swear\u201d\n\n...to each other unironically. Even when noone could be listening in so using a code name for the sake a privacy would be completely un needed. \n\nOnline communities dedicated to Substance use  & EDs have a lot in common so it makes sense they have similar Jargon. \n\nSU & ED are maladaptive coping mechanisms, affected individuals likely have friends/families who don\u2019t understand it, affected individuals usually have ambivalent beliefs/feelings but deep down known it\u2019s harmful or atleast very unproductive \u2014 and many people are feel mild shame. So of course tons people enjoy giving it euphemism names and/or personifying it as a way of emotionally dealing with it.\n\nI think we should allow people get *a little* more relaxed and colloquial with the terms/speech when we\u2019re talking about our ED behaviors without rushing to think \u201c*they\u2019re promoting the social glorification of mental illness and destructive behavior\u201d*.  The reason they\u2019re being **so** unsophisticated with their speech  may not be because their proud and don\u2019t understand the seriousness and function disabling nature of their ED (romanticizing).\n\nThe other possibility is that it\u2019s tempting to be laid back because: Dedicated online spaces are probably the only place in the whole world where everyone \u201cin the room\u201d is going to feel blas\u00e9 towards someone talking about compulsively purging halo top and depression-fasting for 26 hours. \n\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR** \n\n**I find it ironic how ED support groups LOVE over analyzing & over moralizing, every little thing people say and are quick to raise a judging finger.**\n\n*support groups* share a lot in common with Web based *subcultures*. NOT necessarily because people in support groups are trying to normalize/romanticize their problem. With subcultures it\u2019s because like minded individuals are coming together. In support groups it\u2019s because people with similar struggles are coming together. \n\nI think people in ED (non pro) communities have good intent when it comes to preventing illness romanticizing, which *is* a real social problem right now. But I think we accidentally put unrealistically high expectations on each other to be #SERIOUSBUSINESS all the time meanwhile we do the ***exact*** same shit as every one else. \n\nSo yeah \n\nI\u2019m an **Alchie** who\u2019s sister is a lazy **stoner** and I suspect my employer is a **fake natty**  \u2014 and  I think \u201c**Rexie**\u201d as an *okay* euphemism/term. This is literally policing people for speaking normally and so many of us fail to see that because of refusal to emotionally separate from bloggers who irritated us in the past",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

If someone had an eating disorder and was trying to recover, and decided to watch that to feel less alone about their struggles, it might just tear down what they worked really hard to build for themselves. I watch that movie specifically when I want to feel invalid and work harder to be skinny. By the end, it seems pro-recovery, but that's not without showing her emaciated body on the ground, and everyone in the world scrambling around feeling scared for her. It's like every anorexic's wet dream. I like the movie, personally, but I completely understand why a lot of people don't.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.\n\nI\u2019ve avoided watching \u201cTo the Bone\u201d the same way i\u2019be avoided \u201cStarving in suburbia\u201d and \u201cFor the love of Nancy\u201d.\n\n I have read a couple summaries and reviews, some of which were accompanied by screenshots. It sounds boring, tired, cliche, and over the top at some points. However, TtB still has a right to *exist*. Also, I\u2019m someone who\u2019s been battling AN for a long time so I\u2019m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect **Hollywood** to not make things over dramatic for the sake of entertainment value while also wanting to satisfy a voyeuristic public. No one is gonna be thinking \u2018OMG PLOT TWIST\u2019 in there head when [\u201c**rexie character**\u201d] says \u201c*Fuck, __thats__ a serving of peanut butter? I guess I\u2019ve been using too much. Only jelly from here on out*\u201d.  No one is gonna be jumping up in down rooting for the character when she finally accepts she\u2019s unhealthy because she now gets sweaty at night, has a pseudo-mustache, gets breakouts & nosebleeds more often, and hasn\u2019t taken a shit in 5 days. \n\n***\n\nThe expectations i have of mainstream movies about mental illness movies (* especially ones that make the mental illness in question known/obvious*) are to not; incite fear, spread propaganda, encourage hatred/social-stigma, or tell a false narrative about the illness.\n\n\u201cFight club\u201d, \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d, Requiem for A Dream\u201d, and \u201cAs good as it gets\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for teaching me about suffers of DID, Personality disorders, SUD, or OCD. If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

There\u2019s  dozens of other examples out there; (Ex. *hippie, preppie, roadie* etc) because that\u2019s just how the English language *works*. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a common worrry of this subreddit that people  are infantilizing, prettifying or glorifying EDs. This is not always warranted because people are often doing  the exact same things everyone else in this society is doing...**speaking** lol. \n\nI think people with EDs are more harsh with each other than other support groups\u2014 like, it\u2019s such a simple and basic looking word and the first thing our mind goes to is someone is might be out to make anorexia seem \u201ccutesy\u201d.  \n\nIf we overheard two people half-jokingly call themselves fatties / junkies in a conversation about their overeating / usage would one of our first concerns be they don\u2019t take it seriously and are trying to make obesity and drug abuse sound cutesy?  \n\nI doubt it. We only hold each other to such high standards and we. moralize each thing we say here.\n\nI did some online lurking because I got fascinated and I really don\u2019t think this word was made by anyone with a motive to romanticize or even by people with EDs. At worst it\u2019s a euphemism.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn\u2019t be off limits.  \n\n***\n\nYou don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d anorexia as if it\u2019s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or \u201cinvalidating\u201d \ud83d\ude10... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust. Thus TtB  isn\u2019t gonna cause someone\u2019s Anorexia. It\u2019s our responsibility it\u2019s most likely someone wanted to trigger themself further and they sought out the content. If to the bone didn\u2019t exist they would of used some older movie or google.",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",

I don't know why someone would watch that unless they wanted to trigger themselves. Even the first time I watched it, before I knew how bad it triggers me, I knew going into it would at least trigger me a little bit (I think anyone with an ED who said they had no idea is at least lying a bit).",

Except this time I\u2019d have a lot more worry about how this is gonna effect work/my job. *Edit: and have to worry about making sure my pets/mail/etc is taken care of* \n\n3) I don\u2019t remember the right word for this feeling but It\u2019s when you feel infantile because you can\u2019t rely on just yourself for help & simultaneously feel kinda guilty/sorry for the people who gotta deal with you \n\nSo it\u2019s not truly a \u201cnightmarish\u201d situation but I\u2019d still say it\u2019s the opposite of a wet dream for some Anorexics lol. \ud83d\ude02",

Though it\u2019s a little much I\u2019m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it\u2019s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I\u2019m the only one talking about this side of the argument.\n\nED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People have become expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proana/trivializing attitudes. As a result it seems like people \u201c*see*\u201d it when it\u2019s not even there.\n\nIt\u2019s well known that *some* people; enjoy being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse makes them cool, think being a bar-alcoholic makes them \u201cfun\u201d, feel totally justified in being an functioning alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, believe not caring about being fit makes them quirky/down to earth, and publicly glamorize overconsumption + glorify obesity. The latter example actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES). Many of these aforementioned people actually oppose science & studies that prove their behavior is a problem/unhealthy/pathological.\n\nHowever, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing, or a lot of indirect shaming (\u201cewww\u201d \u201ccrinnnggeee\u201d) in their support group spaces. Which is good because the simple *existence* of arrogant people with the doesn\u2019t invalidate people who are struggling/suffering.\n\nIn which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and uniquely vain. It assumes we are more likely to be na\u00edve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else. I don\u2019t think this is fair at all, imo we\u2019re  just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling \n\n\n\n***\n\n***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :\n\n\nThe way I perceive it; it\u2019s probably*very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named \u201c***EDAnonymous***\u201d and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So, suspicion/vigilance/formality is much less warranted here than somewhere like tumblr, Ig, or Twitter.\n\n The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it\u2019s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Neurotics Anonymous [etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twelve-step_groups) Equating us to these groups puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful nature of EDs and doesn\u2019t let you forget it. I have my doubts the name is highly appealing to people who think their ED is trivial or aspirational.\n\nDeep down I think most people know this and are just annoyed by such minor/benign shit because it\u2019s popular to be annoyed by it and they don\u2019t want to feel like the outcast/odd-one-out.",

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction. \n\nMaybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them. If a person in ED recovery chooses to watch an ED movie, that is on them if they are triggered.",
