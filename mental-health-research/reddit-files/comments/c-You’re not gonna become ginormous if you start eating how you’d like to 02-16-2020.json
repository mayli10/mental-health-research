So if I still maintain or gain when I'm in a calorie deficit, how could I not gain a shit ton of weight when I start eating how I'd like?",

When I came back I thought of myself as a disgusting blob who had filed and was probably twenty pounds heavier than when I left. Even though I was still wearing tight clothes that made me feel happy and skinny, I could tell I had gained weight and I thought everyone would notice and know I was a failure. When I stepped on the scale again after several months, I had gained 7 pounds since the last time I checked. Also, no one noticed at all. After MONTHS of a lot of french food, pasta, ham and cheese sandwiches, butter on baguette every morning, a metric ton of delicious wine, fresh eclairs any time I was bummed or anxious (a lot), and for some reason a lot of mcdonalds and mcflurrys (i swear they\u2019re better in france?) etc. Blew my mind.",

The worst part is that it doesn't slow down after being on it a while, and you get hungrier because it messes with your blood sugars.\n\nI have a half baked theory that people with binge eating disorder get surges of cortisol from their own body which does the same thing. Makes them hungrier, hungrier for the wrong things, and puts weight on even faster than conventional wisdom would suggest.\n\nEdit: I don't have binge eating disorder, but I think my spouse verges on it, so I've looked into it...as well as just reading about it in general with trying to get my head straight with my own disordered eating.",

Yes, I still restrict but it's getting better every day, I don't deprive myself of the things I want.\n\nAnd I don't look any different. I feel better on most days, my skin is regaining some color, my hair doesn't look *as* thin (it's still pretty thin but it's looking healthier), my heart isn't hurting as bad, my joints aren't aching as often, and I'm not miserable because I'm withholding cravings! \n\nYou go eat what you want and I can *promise* you that you're not going to \"balloon up\" like your ED says you're going to.

Sometimes I still get the urges, but they\u2019re nowhere near how bad they were before. You\u2019re more likely to lose control, by trying to maintain control. The body senses starvation and starts to panic- binging is almost like a survival mechanism. It\u2019ll take a little bit of time, but you should definitely see results once you allow your body to feel safe. Sending hugs and wishing you the best \ud83d\udc96",

And there are other things to focus on instead of eating!! And you can form a personality!! recovery is super hard but so, so rewarding. And eating again makes you less obsessive about these things.

I started eating whatever I wanted, and for 6 months all I could do was binge on all the food I missed for the last 3 years of my life. I gained >!40 pounds !<pretty rapidly, and went from  underweight, to a mid-normal weight for my height). After those 6 months, without doinng anything whatsoever, I ***very very*** slowly had a decrease in appetite as my body returned to normal, and I began to lose weight each month, a total of roughly>!25 pounds!< after almost a whole year, and now I'm at the lower end of a normal BMI and I look normal-thin instead of skeletal.\n\nIt took a long time for my body to balance out though. I got my period back for the first time in 3 years during the first 2 months of recovery and I bled for 2 months *straight* and I broke out in pimples all over my face and back (which never ever happens to me). I couldn't stop eating everything in sight and it took a long time to understand and recognize my hunger/fullness cues. I didn't start dropping the recovery weight until I ate enough that I no longer felt sick and no longer felt food-focused.\n\nTo be honest, I feel kind of ashamed of my small-size. I feel self conscious that I \"don't look like I recovered enough\" whatever that means, and felt like I have something to prove. But I know for certain that I'm eating exactly how much my body wants regularly and that's the best I can do.",
