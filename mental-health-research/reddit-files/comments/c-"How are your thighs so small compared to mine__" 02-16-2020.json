Real *discipline* and *self control* is eating a balanced and healthy diet, whereas using behaviors is the easy way out in many cases. You have every right to be annoyed with people being nosey and making assumptions but I wouldn't give yourself so much credit about having an eating disorder, as if it's a good thing to be admired.",

Every day is a huge fight to not overeat, if not binge. I physically cannot REALLY binge but I still try which leads to purging. I try so, so hard to tell myself \"I want this!\" \"Food won't solve your problems!\" And while I DO believe both... Sometimes, I just want to settle down with a pint ice cream and CHILL like a normal person but I can't because I feel so gross and I'm so scared of going back to my old ways.\n\nAt my worst points in restriction, I've found myself thinking the exact same things and pushing them onto others.
