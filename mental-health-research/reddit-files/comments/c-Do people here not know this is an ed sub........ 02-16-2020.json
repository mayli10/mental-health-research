Although, it should be obvious that ED complications are a result of nutrient deficiency, and vitamins are important damage control, which \"just eating\" can't always account for. My GP said \"don't be afraid to have a piece of cake once in a while\" in response to my anemia, whereas my nutritionist (who actually understands eds) recommended lots of spinach and greens with iron and vitamins I was missing. Not so much being focused on \"eating normally\" but repairing any damage and vitamin deficiencies.",
