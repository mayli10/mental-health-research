It feels like when I don't restrict I get lost in a hazy fog. I'm not as motivated as I was when this all began, yet I want to be underweight just as much, if not more. When I do restrict, it feels like I'm up at 5am; inhaling the clear, cold air. \n\nI know it will be easier not to eat when I go back to school, and it will be harder to eat as well. You see, my girlfriend knows about my eating disorder but has been off school for a few weeks. When she's not here I have to pretend I'm ok, or else the others will start noticing too. She will be back at school now, and I know that if someone knows about my eating disorder I find it harder to eat in front of them. It's like I don't have to hide that part of me around her because she knows now. There will be panic attacks, there will be tantrums and fights but I am determined not to eat. I can't wait to go back because of this. Despite all the stress facing me at school at least I can have more control again. \n\nSometimes when I talk about my ED I feel like I'm reading from a textbook, but this sort of stuff is written in textbooks because it's true. Again, sorry for the ramble that turned into. ",

Having said which, I truly admire lots of ED victims (if I may use that word non-judgmentally) especially of the restrictive subtypes. Maybe my admiration got lost in my blizzard of words (and I'm doing it again, crimminy) but you all have exceptional focus and integrity, more than you know! You are brave. Soldier on.",

It feels like when I don't restrict I get lost in a hazy fog. I'm not as motivated as I was when this all began, yet I want to be underweight just as much, if not more. When I do restrict, it feels like I'm up at 5am; inhaling the clear, cold air. \n\nI know it will be easier not to eat when I go back to school, and it will be harder to eat as well. You see, my girlfriend knows about my eating disorder but has been off school for a few weeks. When she's not here I have to pretend I'm ok, or else the others will start noticing too. She will be back at school now, and I know that if someone knows about my eating disorder I find it harder to eat in front of them. It's like I don't have to hide that part of me around her because she knows now. There will be panic attacks, there will be tantrums and fights but I am determined not to eat. I can't wait to go back because of this. Despite all the stress facing me at school at least I can have more control again. \n\nSometimes when I talk about my ED I feel like I'm reading from a textbook, but this sort of stuff is written in textbooks because it's true.

It feels like when I don't restrict I get lost in a hazy fog. I'm not as motivated as I was when this all began, yet I want to be underweight just as much, if not more. When I do restrict, it feels like I'm up at 5am; inhaling the clear, cold air. \n\nI know it will be easier not to eat when I go back to school, and it will be harder to eat as well. You see, my girlfriend knows about my eating disorder but has been off school for a few weeks. When she's not here I have to pretend I'm ok, or else the others will start noticing too. She will be back at school now, and I know that if someone knows about my eating disorder I find it harder to eat in front of them. It's like I don't have to hide that part of me around her because she knows now. There will be panic attacks, there will be tantrums and fights but I am determined not to eat. I can't wait to go back because of this. Despite all the stress facing me at school at least I can have more control again. \n\nSometimes when I talk about my ED I feel like I'm reading from a textbook, but this sort of stuff is written in textbooks because it's true. Again, sorry for the ramble that turned into. ",

I find many ED sufferers capable of great character and often of a stoic nobility. It is an admirable trait to oppose the overindulgence (and dare we admit, gluttony) which society all too often stokes, with engineered, addictive fake foods shoved in our faces 24/7. \n\nYes, moderation in all things, and I empathize with victims of body dysmorphia and other potentially lethal complications of EDs. I would wish none of those illnesses upon anybody!\n\nAnd yet, I applaud all those whose motives at heart are healthy and who strive to keep eating within limits and not surrender to the hog-wild food-fest swamping us in a globesity epidemic that buries millions in misery. *\u2026[edit: phrasing clarified.]*",

I like your quicksand metaphor a lot. To borrow from that: I feel like I was stuck in quicksand, my head just above so I could still breath. Then, little by little, I accidentally pushed myself out, and now I'm only up to my waist. But I miss the quicksand. It became part of me; I learnt how to survive stuck in the quicksand and now that I'm nearly out everything has lost meaning. I'm begging the quicksand to drag me back down, and I'm frustrated that I let myself get this far out. So I've made a plan to re-bury myself, this time it has to work. My friends and family don't understand how I live in it, they tell me it's so much nicer when you're out, and that I'll see that when I'm free. But I'll refuse and fight them as i sink back down.\n\nEveryone knows that if you struggle in quicksand you sink further. It's just occurred to me that as I struggle against my friends trying to help me, the further I sink down into the quicksand of an ED.\n\nSorry for borrowing your metaphor, hope you don't mind, and sorry this turned into a ramble.",
