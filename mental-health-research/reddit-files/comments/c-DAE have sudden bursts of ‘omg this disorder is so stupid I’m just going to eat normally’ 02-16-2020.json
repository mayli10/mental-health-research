It did take motivation to stick to this but something just clicked in my head again after I hit a certain weight (basically gained all, that I had lost, back to being obese) and coming back from a vacation.\n\nBut I'm scared that this shit happens in waves and it'll come crashing down one way or another. Still rather hopeful that this 'normal' would stick though.\n\nThis also makes me feel guilty for not doing enough and getting faster weight loss (but I know it would cause me to binge the more I restrict). And here I was supposed to get help for my binging but now I see no reason as it's not happening currently anyway :/",
