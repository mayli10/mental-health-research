Ate alright, got high and went for an hour-long walk, cleaned the kitchen and cooked some healthy ish for the week.  Missed a call from my husband so he highjacked our Alexa and started playing our first dance song and I had a total mental breakdown on the floor while our cats fought in the bedroom.  Finished my stats problem set with 87% and ate an entire loaf of bread and half a jar of olives in the kitchen while doing a happy dance.  Told myself I would be in bed before 11 but that's not happening cause I still have like 10 oz of wine left in my fridge that I might as well drink tonight.",

I'm always fighting my tiny attention span. It's so frustrating because I do all the work others do, but there's always SOMETHING I did wrong, neglect a variable here, scribble out something over here, didn't define something here...it can get close to perfect, but will never be flawless. (If it helps, though, the academic anorexic seems to be more of a figment of the ED brain, another bar raised by perfectionism, so don't beat yourself up too much.)",

To all of you who struggle with school, I highly recommend getting accomodations or just reaching out to your professors. I don't ask my students for details. When they say \"there's just a lot of stuff going on in my life right now,\" I'll give them the extension, offer to talk about it, and mention resources available. I don't need to hear all the details of what's going on to be able to cut them some slack. I doubt everyone who teaches will do this (at least they didn't when I was an undergrad), but it's worth a shot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. If any of you want study tips, let me know.",
