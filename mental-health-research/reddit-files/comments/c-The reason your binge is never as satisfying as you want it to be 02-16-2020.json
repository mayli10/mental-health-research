Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

I\u2019m just slow, sip on it whenever I feel, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m done and I don\u2019t think about I anymore. I\u2019ll leave a drink half or mostly finished if I don\u2019t want more.

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.

I\u2019m just slow, sip on it whenever I feel, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m done and I don\u2019t think about I anymore. I\u2019ll leave a drink half or mostly finished if I don\u2019t want more. But if the drink is very very sugary or not very alcoholic (angry orchard cider or blended daiquiris or baileys or pina coladas that aren\u2019t too strong) I\u2019ll down them quickly and want to finish them off",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out! Thanks for the recommendation!  ",

                            "Text": "It\u2019s definitely related to addiction, I think binging is a mix of dopamine and opioid issues. I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going.

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to).

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.

I\u2019m just slow, sip on it whenever I feel, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m done and I don\u2019t think about I anymore. I\u2019ll leave a drink half or mostly finished if I don\u2019t want more.

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

I\u2019m just slow, sip on it whenever I feel, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m done and I don\u2019t think about I anymore. I\u2019ll leave a drink half or mostly finished if I don\u2019t want more. But if the drink is very very sugary or not very alcoholic (angry orchard cider or blended daiquiris or baileys or pina coladas that aren\u2019t too strong) I\u2019ll down them quickly and want to finish them off",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

I\u2019m just slow, sip on it whenever I feel, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m done and I don\u2019t think about I anymore. I\u2019ll leave a drink half or mostly finished if I don\u2019t want more. But if the drink is very very sugary or not very alcoholic (angry orchard cider or blended daiquiris or baileys or pina coladas that aren\u2019t too strong) I\u2019ll down them quickly and want to finish them off",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going.

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to).

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Everything I\u2019ve read recently had supported the opioid system as the primary reinforcement - a reinforcement in the act of binge eating (not the planning aspect) involving the Ventral Tegmental Area, which in a cascade of events also involves dopamine and other neurotransmitters. \n\nEverything about this feels counter intuitive (how do people that don\u2019t plan their binging have this?? What about the relief people find from binging and not the planning?? How is the neurobiology basically the same as addiction yet addictions don\u2019t cause a dependency from the act of planning?? Why doesn\u2019t stopping the planning stop the binging then??) but most things we think we understand end up being completely different than we conceptualize them! \u2018Tis the beauty of science, always learning! \n\nI\u2019m stoked to see what you\u2019ve read; I was pretty passionate about this after doing research for a psychopharmacology paper!

Most of the time as soon as I get the urge I\u2019ll act on it and rush to the store and rush home.  The quicker the better,  but that sensation while I\u2019m rushing is pure excitement of what is to come.

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I\u2019m just slow, sip on it whenever I feel, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m done and I don\u2019t think about I anymore. I\u2019ll leave a drink half or mostly finished if I don\u2019t want more. But if the drink is very very sugary or not very alcoholic (angry orchard cider or blended daiquiris or baileys or pina coladas that aren\u2019t too strong) I\u2019ll down them quickly and want to finish them off",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

I used to have a problem with drugs cause of my addictive personality, which I manage to stay away from now but seem to have substituted food instead. The preparation, lining up my pills or foil or pipe and lighter and baggies and everything I'd need and getting a good song on and getting it all together was sooo good. That same excitement in the preparation was definitely there, and I even find myself getting home with food and lining everything up in front of me the same way. ",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.

I\u2019m just slow, sip on it whenever I feel, and when I\u2019m done I\u2019m done and I don\u2019t think about I anymore. I\u2019ll leave a drink half or mostly finished if I don\u2019t want more.

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

                            "Text": "I know guessing doesn\u2019t mean much in the scientific realm, but anecdotally I know that people have a different reason for binging for the first time versus the habitual binging that comes later.\n\nAre you asking what strong reinforcement makes us desire the plan to binge?  Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

If I was stressed, I could use these as an emergency, however it was advised that I schedule these 3 things through the day.\n\nFor me it's: \n\n1) 6am: get a good workout in - this sets me up feeling good and already accomplished for the day \n\n2) 12pm: go outside and listen to some music \n\n3) 6pm or when I get home from work: play an hour of video games and drink tea \n\nHonestly, I probably only spend $10 a day on food now because of this.

Sadness. :( \n\n\nI agree with you; I realized that when my stomach was off my entire brain was 200% off. I was told I was crazy/that it must have been a placebo thing, but I really believed there was a connection. Low and behold, we\u2019re starting to discover that may be the case. It\u2019s a fine line between EBT & non-EBT approaches; everything was once EBT before the research was done, and the lack of research doesn\u2019t mean that such doesn\u2019t exist! It may have not been adequately proven. \n\n Now that I think about it-  It sounds like the stage in addiction where addicts bodies are triggered by their environment/people/places/etc., and their bodies appropriately prepare for the substance they\u2019re about to use. The thing is, even if they don\u2019t use their bodies can still have that reaction- and it\u2019s not the mechanism behind addiction that makes it compulsive.\n\nI\u2019ll have to check that book out!

I started taking low dose naltrexone for my binging and it cured it (and my overeating and my ED) for a month. Then the overeating came back, and then I stopped the LDN. But the binging never really came back. I\u2019ve binged a few times since but nowhere near to the level it was at before and I had issues with it for over 15 years. I am currently getting that dopamine rush. I also just stopped taking and NDRI and the last week has been hell with my brain obsessively thinking about wanting to eat non fucking stop and even when I cave in, it comes back an hour later (I have been constantly overeating but still not binging as bad as I used to). So yeah it\u2019s a mess, I wish we understood how this all worked better so I could outsmart my own brain...stupid fucker",

I don\u2019t at all deny that people have rituals (esp people with mental health conditions lol) or that people with addictions/EDs don\u2019t find a sort of pleasure in them. What I\u2019m wondering is (1) how or why our brains would hypothetically release a rush of dopamine the first time we plan a binge, and (2) how that would turn into binge eating, in the theory the OP played. \n\nWith addictions, the substances override our brains and we get hooked. With binging, the food boosts our dopamine. What boosts our dopamine enough to continue coming back with food planning though? Ie, the first time somebody over eats and finds that it soothes their anxiety or makes them feel better, they like the dopamine release. With the ritual though, what strong reinforcement is there that makes us keep coming back? ",

Or what reinforces the binge?\n\nThe binge obviously comes with satisfying feelings, and likely the first time someone binges they stop a lot sooner than they will once the ED develops.  So the first time it\u2019s the satisfying feeling of being very full and relaxed, but after that it\u2019s chasing the high.\n\nIt reminds me of when I used to abuse vyvanse.  Once I popped the pill, I would get a rush and clean everything in preparation for the vyvanse to hit.  It almost felt like I was already on vyvanse.  So the excitement of knowing it was coming gave me a pretty impressive natural high.",

So after reading this, I spent the next hour browsing food on Pinterest and any time I got the urge to go into the kitchen I tried to really, really picture exactly what I desperately wanted and then found it again on Pinterest and started planning getting groceries for it and then making it and eating it. I would still get urges to actually get up and eat something but I told myself that my dopamine would drop if I actually did that so I searched for more things and kept that going. Definitely felt that brain rush a bunch of times and I finally went to bed and didn\u2019t mess myself up :).",
