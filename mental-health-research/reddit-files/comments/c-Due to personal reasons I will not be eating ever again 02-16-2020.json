After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought. I\u2019m not wanting to act on those thoughts but they are there and it\u2019s a serious thing. \n\nI know EDs have a lot to do with our appearances and there\u2019s a stigma that we are vein but there\u2019s more to it then people know.\n\nI\u2019m probably being too serious since this is just the internet and that person is an idiot but this means a lot to me as someone who attempted twice and is still struggling with mental illness. Everyday is a battle.\n\nFr if anyone in this sub wants to talk, even just chat about other stuff to get your mind off the serious things, I\u2019m here.

After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought.

If you are a teenager, I hope to whoever is out there that you grow out of this phase and deeply regret your current mentality in the future. \n\nIf you are an adult, you should be completely and utterly ashamed of yourself, and please understand that you are a bad person, who may change one day but I doubt it. I hope that you have nobody but yourself and the just as despicable incels you associate yourself with on the internet when you need somebody to tell your troubles to, or to help you. Because you don't deserve to be treated as an equal by those who you are horribly bigoted towards.",

Anything can be triggering and I don\u2019t mean that in a snowflake bs way (god I can\u2019t believe I said snowflake lol). \n\nFor a month now I\u2019ve been on best rest and really have been trying to eat to heal better/faster and it\u2019s been a struggle. After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought. I\u2019m not wanting to act on those thoughts but they are there and it\u2019s a serious thing. \n\nI know EDs have a lot to do with our appearances and there\u2019s a stigma that we are vein but there\u2019s more to it then people know.\n\nI\u2019m probably being too serious since this is just the internet and that person is an idiot but this means a lot to me as someone who attempted twice and is still struggling with mental illness. Everyday is a battle.\n\nFr if anyone in this sub wants to talk, even just chat about other stuff to get your mind off the serious things, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m bored as hell and always on my phone since I\u2019m still on bed rest but even after that I\u2019m here for y\u2019all. \n\n\ud83c\udf51 is same as reddit and I\u2019m always open to new IG friends, for ref I\u2019m 26F",

After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought. I\u2019m not wanting to act on those thoughts but they are there and it\u2019s a serious thing. \n\nI know EDs have a lot to do with our appearances and there\u2019s a stigma that we are vein but there\u2019s more to it then people know.\n\nI\u2019m probably being too serious since this is just the internet and that person is an idiot but this means a lot to me as someone who attempted twice and is still struggling with mental illness. Everyday is a battle.\n\nFr if anyone in this sub wants to talk, even just chat about other stuff to get your mind off the serious things, I\u2019m here.

After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought. I\u2019m not wanting to act on those thoughts but they are there and it\u2019s a serious thing. \n\nI know EDs have a lot to do with our appearances and there\u2019s a stigma that we are vein but there\u2019s more to it then people know.\n\nI\u2019m probably being too serious since this is just the internet and that person is an idiot but this means a lot to me as someone who attempted twice and is still struggling with mental illness. Everyday is a battle.\n\nFr if anyone in this sub wants to talk, even just chat about other stuff to get your mind off the serious things, I\u2019m here.

Anything can be triggering and I don\u2019t mean that in a snowflake bs way (god I can\u2019t believe I said snowflake lol). \n\nFor a month now I\u2019ve been on best rest and really have been trying to eat to heal better/faster and it\u2019s been a struggle. After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought. I\u2019m not wanting to act on those thoughts but they are there and it\u2019s a serious thing. \n\nI know EDs have a lot to do with our appearances and there\u2019s a stigma that we are vein but there\u2019s more to it then people know.\n\nI\u2019m probably being too serious since this is just the internet and that person is an idiot but this means a lot to me as someone who attempted twice and is still struggling with mental illness. Everyday is a battle.\n\nFr if anyone in this sub wants to talk, even just chat about other stuff to get your mind off the serious things, I\u2019m here.

After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought. I\u2019m not wanting to act on those thoughts but they are there and it\u2019s a serious thing. \n\nI know EDs have a lot to do with our appearances and there\u2019s a stigma that we are vein but there\u2019s more to it then people know.\n\nI\u2019m probably being too serious since this is just the internet and that person is an idiot but this means a lot to me as someone who attempted twice and is still struggling with mental illness. Everyday is a battle.\n\nFr if anyone in this sub wants to talk, even just chat about other stuff to get your mind off the serious things, I\u2019m here.

After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought.

If you are a teenager, I hope to whoever is out there that you grow out of this phase and deeply regret your current mentality in the future. \n\nIf you are an adult, you should be completely and utterly ashamed of yourself, and please understand that you are a bad person, who may change one day but I doubt it. I hope that you have nobody but yourself and the just as despicable incels you associate yourself with on the internet when you need somebody to tell your troubles to, or to help you.

Anything can be triggering and I don\u2019t mean that in a snowflake bs way (god I can\u2019t believe I said snowflake lol). \n\nFor a month now I\u2019ve been on best rest and really have been trying to eat to heal better/faster and it\u2019s been a struggle. After any meal that isn\u2019t safe (basically anything that isn\u2019t salad or canned soup) I hate myself and have those suicidal thought. I\u2019m not wanting to act on those thoughts but they are there and it\u2019s a serious thing. \n\nI know EDs have a lot to do with our appearances and there\u2019s a stigma that we are vein but there\u2019s more to it then people know.\n\nI\u2019m probably being too serious since this is just the internet and that person is an idiot but this means a lot to me as someone who attempted twice and is still struggling with mental illness. Everyday is a battle.\n\nFr if anyone in this sub wants to talk, even just chat about other stuff to get your mind off the serious things, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m bored as hell and always on my phone since I\u2019m still on bed rest but even after that I\u2019m here for y\u2019all. \n\n\ud83c\udf51 is same as reddit and I\u2019m always open to new IG friends, for ref I\u2019m 26F",

If you are a teenager, I hope to whoever is out there that you grow out of this phase and deeply regret your current mentality in the future. \n\nIf you are an adult, you should be completely and utterly ashamed of yourself, and please understand that you are a bad person, who may change one day but I doubt it. I hope that you have nobody but yourself and the just as despicable incels you associate yourself with on the internet when you need somebody to tell your troubles to, or to help you.
