I didn't subscribe to fph when it existed but checked a few times and remember all the people I had autotagged from TRP, incels etc since I was active in the bluepill community. I imagine much of the fatlogic userbase is the same or similar. This also goes for many men as a whole on the internet but I am guessing they are upset they cannot \"get\" thinner women. Also even now on fatlogic you still get many people supporting the \"his BMI is high because he lots of muscles\" argument despite majority of men not being bodybuilders. There will also be a waterfall of comments from women saying \"I am skinny/fit but love big teddy guys! :D\" further boosting them. I am not saying anyone deserves mean comments, but the difference in reactions is disheartening. I forget who it was, but someone from this sub recently called that shit out and got attacked for it there. \n\nI remember getting into a spat with someone on... publicfreakout maybe? (I know, low hanging fruit, but a good example) saying Alex Jones was still a very healthy weight despite having a massive beer belly because he looked like he lifted underneath the layer of fat. In that same sub there is a deluge of comments about women being a whale at the slightest hint of being overweight.",

They make stupid fucking arguments \"they're eating our taxes tho\" no you dumb shit fat people pay taxes they dont decide how they're distributed that is a multi faceted issue and fat people are a byproduct of the fallout from that shit show.
