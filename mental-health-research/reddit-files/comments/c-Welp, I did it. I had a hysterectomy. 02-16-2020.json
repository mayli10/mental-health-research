I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it. Then when I wanted to recover, I engaged in other destructive behaviors because I no longer was \"allowed\" to engage in ED ones.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

My mother ended up being misdiagnosed as manic bipolar and given antipsychotics when she in reality just needed some estrogen supplements. For whatever reason, the effects of sudden hormone fuckery do not seem to be at the forefront of a lot of doctors assessments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's to hoping that this change gives you some mental and physical energy back to fight against the bullshit that is ED's. <3333",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it.

                        "Text": "I get it. You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it.

Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

                    "Text": "TW: weight talk\n\nOh dude I am so sorry you are going through that. I had the same issue for years...no one could tell me for sure the cause. I had every test and ultrasound you could get. \n\nI finally had a reproductive endocrinologist who said it was an issue with my pituitary gland not sending the right signals to my brain. And I asked \"oh wow, my first real diagnosis! How do we fix that?\" And he just frowned and said if he knew, he would take me with him to Stockholm when collected the nobel prize. AKA there is no known cure. The medical community hasn't figured it out...or maybe they don't bother trying because birth control is so good at masking the symptoms.\n\nMy options were birth control forever and that just made the migraines and anxiety worse. Or a fertility drug that *might* work but was not covered by insurance and was so expensive. I didn't like the idea of being on any drug until menopause. A hysterectomy was the surefire \"cure\" that would give me my life back asap.\n\nI asked the endocrinologist if weight gain could have caused this and he said only if I were 150lbs overweight. And I'm only 20 lbs overweight. :(\n\nAs for your insurance issue..did they say why it was not covered? Maybe they marked it as fertility or something? I know a lot of plans do not cover for that. If so you can ask the doctor to change the diagnosis and resubmit the claim. It never hurts to ask!\n\nLet me know if you're comfortable with telling me and maybe I can think of something?\n\nAnyway, thanks for the well wishes!",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it.

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

                "Text": "Whoa, reading this feels so familiar. I was bleeding nonstop for over a year straight when I relapsed. Trying to find out what was wrong was so stressful and horrible. It was like my body turned against me and there was no end in sight. The root cause was (and still is) a big mystery. It interfered with every aspect of my life. I switched to a hormonal IUD and began losing clumps of hair in the shower. I added progesterone, and it made me so moody that I \\*cried\\* because a bee was trapped on the train during my commute. It just made me feel so crazy, but I also couldn't share very widely what was going on because nobody wants to hear about your stupid uterus problems. I  managed to get it under control with my current round of birth control, but who knows how long that will last? Even getting my period now once every 8 weeks with the pill, I still experience residual stress from that time.\n\nAs someone who doesn't want to have kids and still finds getting a period slightly traumatic, a hysterectomy always felt like a long-term kill switch. What was the process to getting an OK from your doc? What did you have to do to prepare?",

                    "Text": "I am so sad to hear of so many others dealing with this! I can attest to the progesterone only pill making my anxiety and mood swings way worse than the combo pill. With progesterone I couldn't ever function for an entire work day. I'd sob for 10, 20, 30 mins at a time! \n\nI try to talk about these issues as often as I can. I don't think they should be taboo or brushed aside. It's a serious disorder damnit!!\n\nFor my preparation I think having tried so many diff brands and forms of birth control and having all the labs and imaging made it easier for my obgyn to get on my side. It was like I had to prove that I did everything else I could first. Even tho my Husband and I have always been like \"eh if kids happen they happen\" and are ok with adoption. But I still had to tell every doctor how much this impacted my quality of life. You gotta make them understand you are in pain. And cannot enjoy a full life like this. \n\nI know on the childfree sub they have some sidebar links for people who have made binders of their info when they see a doc. They also have a list of doctors around the world who have given people a hysterectomy when requested. \n\nReally just show them you are prepared, you understand the risks and stress to them that whatever issues this causes (be it anemia, anxiety, painful horrible cramps, pain during sex, or just track you bleeding...I tracked my blood loss using a menstrual cup and wrote down for my doc how many LITERS of blood I lost) are issues you cannot deal with. Be your own advocate.\n\nI dunno what part of the world you are in but I saw Dr. Devin Garza is Austin for mine. He is literally a robotic surgery instructor and has done sooo many surgeries I felt safe with him. My first appointment when I told him I wanted this done he said \"it's your body, I'm here to do what you want\" and I almost cried. There are good docs out there. I promise!\n\nLemme know if u have other questions!",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it. Then when I wanted to recover, I engaged in other destructive behaviors because I no longer was \"allowed\" to engage in ED ones. It's nice to know that there are folks out there figuring things out and willing to share this. You're amazing for having done this for yourself and advocated for yourself the way you did.",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

                    "Text": "Legit switching to a menstrual cup was the only way for the periods to be mildy managable. (Pro tip, if u bleed a lot and want to use one, I reccomend the saalt cup. It's softer so wearing if for fucking weeks on end is a lil more comfy than the diva cup). If you're comfy with trying one I highly reccomend it. Saved me loads of money as my first one lasted 3 years before I wanted a new one.\n\nBut yes! I'd bring up my bleeding in conversations and people would look at me like I had 3 heads. As if the ED behaviors didn't bring me enough of those looks lmao.\n\nBut I am glad the IUD seems to be working for you! Don't be afraid to seek out a different brand if (God forbid) this one doesn't meet your needs. The birthcontrol sub is a great resource!\n\nWishing you the best of luck!",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing.

                        "Text": "I get it. You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

This sub is just so dang important with how nice and supportive everyone is.\n\nI replied to a similar question up above; but mostly I just had to prove that I knew of the consequences of the surgery and had tried lots of other options first. Multiple types of birth control, loads of labs, imaging and had record of 2 previous surgeries. One for endometriosis and a D&C (where they scrape off your uterine lining) and then another D&C. \n\nI also tracked how long I bled, and with the help of my menstrual cup I could tell my doc the volume of blood lost (legit liters). And had labs to show I was anemic as fuck.  I also let him know about my heinous cramps, pain during (deep) sex and pain even when I wasn't bleeding. It's kinda shitty to have to prove all that...but worth it in the end!\n\nCheck out the childfree sub's side bar. They have lists of doctors around the country that will perform a hysterectomy by request!",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh.

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain. Maybe that is what you are having too?\n\nIt may take a while, but it's worth the trouble, believe me. I hope you get an answer soon!",

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",

I can relate from experience - I've been having the same issues since my early teens and even after more than a decade of various meds and doctors, nothing is helping. I mentioned that I was thinking about hysterectomy to my family and they were decidedly against it, but in the end, I will do what my doctor and I will agree is best. It's seriously such a trip to finally see someone successfully dealing with the same problem, although I do not wish these issues on anybody.\n\nThank you for being inspiring, I hope you heal soon <3",

I thought it may have been a thyroid issue due to them running in my family, but no dice there.  Surprisingly my blood tests don\u2019t show anemia.  I\u2019ve had an ultrasound recently as well as multiple pap smears (my first came back abnormal so the second ob/gyn i visited wanted to do another.)  I had actually gotten the nexplanon implant to try regulate it, that didn\u2019t work so they put me on the pill which worked for about a week and stopped.\n\nSo far the general consensus is \u201coh you\u2019re recovering from your ED!\u201d (i had explained that 2 years prior I had lost 30-40 pounds in a year and had actually lost my period during that time.)  or \u201cIt\u2019s the nexplanon!\u201d which I highly doubt as this has been ongoing since before the nexplanon was in.\n\nMy insurance hasn\u2019t said anything about why it wasnt covered, and honestly neither the hospital nor the insurance has given me an itemized bill, but I know that I had the same tests run less than a year ago so my assumption is that\u2019s why the didn\u2019t cover it.  They also didn\u2019t cover my ultrasound test either.  (But I ended up paying it anyways.)  I actually know someone who is head nurse at the hospital and have been meaning to ask her about it but haven\u2019t gotten the chance yet.",

It could be a different diagnosis from last year or maybe even they changed something in the policy?\n\nBut ugh to the \"oh it's ur ED or it's ur nexplanon\"...sure buddy. Just point to something that is the patient's \"fault\". Especially when it's been going on longer! One doc tried to tell me it was a cyst on my ovary. When I've had the issue for 10 years and the cyst (a simple fluid filled one) had literally just cropped up in the last 2 months. *eyeroll*\n\nBlood work is a funny thing. Even tho my hormones are in normal ranges, they don't follow the correct pattern. My doc drew me [this](https://i.imgur.com/ufZSmaF.jpg) to try and explain.

My ED was my way of behaving for when I could not deal with this problem, and couldn't tell anyone about it.

You have obviously gone through tougher things than me, but I have been tested for endo for my extreme PMS symptoms (bleeding heavily, long periods, severe cramping, extreme fatigue, basically all the other shitty symptoms, etc) but the ultrasound came back normal. I had a pelvic one though and someone said that I should consider doing a vaginal ultrasound. Getting my IUD (twice, I\u2019m on my second one now, only had the first for 1.5 years bc I\u2019m a fkn idiot) was the most painful thing I\u2019ve ever experienced and I baffled my OBGYN both times with my body reactions. However, it put all of the other shitty things to rest for the most part. I\u2019ll still get tenderness, hormonal acne, sometimes some moodiness but I don\u2019t have to deal with all of that bs anymore. Huge change. \n\nAlso I got diagnosed with ADHD last year and getting on medication turned my life around so much. \n\nI have chronic back pain and only a few years ago I started getting treatments (like massage) for it, and was diagnosed with non severe scoliosis and chronic back pain. It was finally taken seriously and it\u2019s been helpful to get treatment. \n\nIt really is quite incredible what our bodies and minds can endure. I\u2019ve been through a lot other than these two things and I\u2019m proud of myself for making it through tbh. I\u2019m like \u201cidk how I did that but *nice*\u201d\n\nSend me a chat message abt help for dealing w scarring & things!!",

We've both had struggles and are different people; which means to me, that both of our troubles are  tough as fuck.\n\nI will say, I've been told and have read that the only way to 100%- diagnose someone with endo is a laparoscopic exam. Legit surgery, because the endo adhesions will not show on an ultrasound, vaginal or otherwise. But it deffo does sound like you have all the symptoms! Please bring it ip to your doc. You shouldn't have to suffer more than necessary!\n\nBut oof I do not envy the iud placement or removals. I had a saline ultrasound once where they put a catheter thru my cervix while I was awake and I almost passed out. You're a trooper, like woah!\n\nAll that plus the ADHD..my heart goes out to you. My Hubs has it and I remember his struggles before he had meds. But he didn't have all the other health issues like you. And I'm sorry it took so long for someone to take your pain seriously. It's so insane how long it takes doctors to listen to us. \n\nBut that's why we talk about it. The more of us that speak out, the easier it will be for future generations. \u2764",
