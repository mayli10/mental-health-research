                "Text": "Me! I'd actually unsubscribed from ProED recently in an attempt to not trigger myself, then when it got taken away and this new sub went up I kind of thought \"WELL better appreciate it while I can\" \n\nEdit since I'm realizing this can sound like the presence of these subs make my ED worse: THEY DON'T. When I thought ProED was a sure thing, I was able to walk away from it thinking it wasn't going anywhere and would still be there for me if I needed support, and I could take some time and figure things out. But feeling like this new sub is so unsure, I feel like I have to cling to it and read every post as soon as it goes up. This sense of insecurity makes me dedicate more time to these types of spaces than I normally would otherwise. ",

I agree with you on the routine thing... once my routine fell apart, I started fasting more, cooking less, exercising less, and self harming more. \n\nAt the same time, losing all online ED communities made me stop comparing myself to others. I always felt I wasn't \"sick enough\" because compared to the girls I was chatting with, I was in decent health. That said, overall I'm desperate to reconnect... I get more out of chatting with other people struggling than I do at a psych appointment. It feels good to not be alone, and it feels good knowing that if / when I finally commit to recovery, there's a massive community here to provide support and good vibes. ",

At first I downloaded fasting apps and tried to beat my time as if I was playing some kind of weird game.

I used New Years as an excuse to get healthy and started focusing on fruits and vegetables and you guessed it, eating as little calories for volume as possible. All that matters is calories. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, I keep binging and restricting and acting like its healthy because 'fruits and veggies'.
