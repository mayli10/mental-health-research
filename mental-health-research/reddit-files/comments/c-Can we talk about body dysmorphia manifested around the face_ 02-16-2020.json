As a little girl I was very confused - story books always talked about *beautiful* princesses and *handsome* princes, so why is this person calling me handsome instead of beautiful? My sister has facial features more like my dad's side of the family, and I look like my mom's side of the family (and my dad's mother hated my mom). So...little kid logic led me to believe that I'm ugly. At 32 I still can't objectively look in the mirror and see what I look like or like what I see. I just see ugly. Last year I threw out 95% of my (expensive) makeup because my inner voice says that it's a waste of product to use it on someone so ugly, and if people who work for Dior/Makeup Forever/Nars/Urban Decay/Benefit/any of those brands *knew* that such an ugly person was wearing it they'd be horrified.\n\nI've had exboyfriends and friends call me \"beautiful\" but....no lol.
