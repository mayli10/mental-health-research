He even literally has a fetish for fat people. Like, he told me he wishes I was fatter (kinda wanted to die reading that). My mind is still like, \"this is a long-con joke. He disgusted by how fat I am.\" You can't win with body dysmorphia. The irony is that I've been depression binge eating for months but ever since I started talking to him, my jeans keep getting looser. RIP\n\nOn the flip side, I saw a YT video the other day with a girl in it that looked almost exactly like my HW self before my gastric bypass and I literally had a panic attack over being reminded of how gigantic I used to be.\n\nSo...\n\nyeeeeeaaah.",

                            "Text": "Nah, it's not. He's not into the feeding aspect. I straight up asked him if he was 'cause I was worried, knowing I couldn't provide that sexual need for him if he was into because I just... refuse to do such a thing. He said he's not, he's just into obese individuals, or as he calls it, \"soft bodies\". I don't get it either. I've reminded him on multiple occasions that I wouldn't gain weight for him and he seems to understand my POV. I appreciate he makes me feel worthy and attractive despite how big and disgusting and worthless I actually am but I still worry there's an ulterior motive, despite us talking long enough that I actually do trust his word. Maybe he's talking to other guys that will gain for him, IDK. I'm not looking for a relationship and he's free to like whoever he wants. If he changes his mind and does start asking me to gain (which isn't in his personality at all), I'd drop him ASAP. I used to be 183kg. It was literal hell. I'm not going back there and anyone who thinks being 400lbs is desirable is sick in the head.",
