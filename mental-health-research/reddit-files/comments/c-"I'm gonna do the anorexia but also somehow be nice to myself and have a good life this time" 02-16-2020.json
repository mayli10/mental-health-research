But then I also had days where I\u2019d eat a bunch of KitKats or get Wendy\u2019s and I didn\u2019t care cuz I wasn\u2019t watching calories at the time as much as I was quantity.  \n\nNow I\u2019m an a new LW after 2 months but it\u2019s like I barely eat a meal, the act of actually eating disgusts me, I purge almost any of the minimal food I do eat.  I went on a binge like on Monday because I was dealing w trauma and just sort of let go of myself, but like since then I\u2019ve been just heavily restricting cuz I\u2019ve felt guilty more and more and I know I\u2019m falling into a deep hole this time.  All started too because between wanting to be thinner and my attitude towards food I just kinda stopped not thinking of it and now I\u2019m like oh no this is bad",
