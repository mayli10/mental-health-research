So when people complain about being hungry, I have to stop myself from saying \"I haven't eaten since ___.\" \n\nIn addition: Yesterday my aunt commented that I'm smaller than I was when she saw me last month. (Can we pretend I don't have a body, please?) She kept asking me what I eat for breakfast, what I eat for lunch, what I eat for dinner. Me internally: \ud83d\ude2c \n\nIt's hard to bullshit a meal plan when you only eat 3 days a week. So I just named off a couple of my safe foods. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02 FML. \n\nI hate that she tries to use me as her motivation to lose weight. Before she leaves she always tells me she wishes she had my will power. Internally I'm just like no the fuck you don't. I wish I could eat like a normal god damn person without freaking out over calories and walking off every single calorie I consume. My family doesn't know about my ED though. So I just give an awkward smile and hope they don't notice my discomfort.",
