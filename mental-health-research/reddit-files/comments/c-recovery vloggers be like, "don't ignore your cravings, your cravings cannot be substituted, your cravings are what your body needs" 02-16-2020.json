If you\u2019re craving it at 2am, then having a small slice is really not going to do you harm.  \n\nI had a restrictive ED though, so obviously it could be different if you have BED.  But if your restrictions are too low, then it\u2019s a guarantee you\u2019ll binge on whatever that craving is.  Plus, if you\u2019re not getting enough calories, your body is going to crave sugar because it\u2019s an instant energy boost. Everyone craves bad food now and then, but if you\u2019re eating enough and living a relatively healthy lifestyle, the cravings should not be out of control. \n\nAnyway, it took me a veeery long time to reach this point.

I would, personally, rather be super skinny but if I had to be \"healthy\", I want to be legit healthy. I want abs and muscles not just \"fat\". There is NOTHING wrong with any body type (unless it's like super emaciated you're about to die or super obese) but it's obvious that girls who were so used to being underweight and skinny will get mad depressed from watching their body just... gain weight. Especially if that weight isn't being converted into lean muscle mass- it is psychological torture. That's why I'm scared of \"recovery\", to me recovery just means getting fatter.",

I would, personally, rather be super skinny but if I had to be \"healthy\", I want to be legit healthy. I want abs and muscles not just \"fat\". There is NOTHING wrong with any body type (unless it's like super emaciated you're about to die or super obese) but it's obvious that girls who were so used to being underweight and skinny will get mad depressed from watching their body just... gain weight. Especially if that weight isn't being converted into lean muscle mass- it is psychological torture. That's why I'm scared of \"recovery\", to me recovery just means getting fatter.",

There is NOTHING wrong with any body type (unless it's like super emaciated you're about to die or super obese) but it's obvious that girls who were so used to being underweight and skinny will get mad depressed from watching their body just... gain weight.

He lets him have plenty of food that I find scary, like mac and cheese and crackers, but he's a growing boy with little appetite, so we need to encourage him to eat high calorie foods. Luckily he also loves fruit, including avocado which is a staple in our house.",

There is NOTHING wrong with any body type (unless it's like super emaciated you're about to die or super obese) but it's obvious that girls who were so used to being underweight and skinny will get mad depressed from watching their body just... gain weight.

I've been smoking like you, to have appetite, but it feels like playing roulette to find out if I'm going to be eating the entire kitchen - like...dry cornmeal...not even good shit - or carry on like normal.\n\nI'm crossfaded at a party right now and so far, so good, but even just having the chips here gives be a bit of anxiety lol. Doesn't feel like I can trust myself with weed and food as it is now.\n\nWe haven't legalized it yet, and everyone's just kinda like \"why the fuck\" because it's one of the first states you'd have expected to legalize. Nobody really cares, though. A cop caught me with my pipe + grinder on the road once omw home from a trip, and just let me keep driving. Bless that fucker. I hope he's living his best life.",

Doesn't feel like I can trust myself with weed and food as it is now.\n\nWe haven't legalized it yet, and everyone's just kinda like \"why the fuck\" because it's one of the first states you'd have expected to legalize. Nobody really cares, though. A cop caught me with my pipe + grinder on the road once omw home from a trip, and just let me keep driving. Bless that fucker. I hope he's living his best life.",

If eating carbs stacked on carbs makes you feel like garbage, part of the IE journey is recognizing that and nourishing yourself in a way that makes you feel good long game. It\u2019s something that takes work and practice. \n\nIt\u2019s also hard af for people with EDs though because there is some weight fluctuation and a learning curve associated with this and that\u2019s terrifying, but if we look at former athletes who transition away from their sport they go through the hyperphagia/craving thing too before their bodies settle back down.",

I think had their system been fitness based instead, they would have had hundreds if not thousands of success stories, but force feeding helpless girls is easy, teaching them how to go to the gym takes too much effort I guess\n\nOr maybe even just something that's been shown to improve people's feelings about their bodies, like yoga or sth.",

I would, personally, rather be super skinny but if I had to be \"healthy\", I want to be legit healthy. I want abs and muscles not just \"fat\". There is NOTHING wrong with any body type (unless it's like super emaciated you're about to die or super obese) but it's obvious that girls who were so used to being underweight and skinny will get mad depressed from watching their body just... gain weight. Especially if that weight isn't being converted into lean muscle mass- it is psychological torture. That's why I'm scared of \"recovery\", to me recovery just means getting fatter.",

I can't go to AYCE anything because it's almost like I view it as a challenge. Sigh. At the same time, it's all I want to do.",

There is NOTHING wrong with any body type (unless it's like super emaciated you're about to die or super obese) but it's obvious that girls who were so used to being underweight and skinny will get mad depressed from watching their body just... gain weight.

I think had their system been fitness based instead, they would have had hundreds if not thousands of success stories, but force feeding helpless girls is easy, teaching them how to go to the gym takes too much effort I guess\n\nOr maybe even just something that's been shown to improve people's feelings about their bodies, like yoga or sth.",

I would, personally, rather be super skinny but if I had to be \"healthy\", I want to be legit healthy. I want abs and muscles not just \"fat\". There is NOTHING wrong with any body type (unless it's like super emaciated you're about to die or super obese) but it's obvious that girls who were so used to being underweight and skinny will get mad depressed from watching their body just... gain weight. Especially if that weight isn't being converted into lean muscle mass- it is psychological torture. That's why I'm scared of \"recovery\", to me recovery just means getting fatter.",

I would still feel guilty and shitty. I continued counting my calories to still have some control and that helped. I just kind of eased myself into it and kept myself distracted with organizing the house etc\n\nBefore, setting something off limits in my head would make me think about it and crave it constantly. For example, crave a donut. My brain would tell me I needed to order a dozen donuts and might as well get some pizza while I\u2019m at it because I\u2019d never be allowed to do it again. Then I wouldn\u2019t eat for 2 weeks\n\nThis change made me be like, I kinda want a donut. So I go get one and that\u2019s that\n\nI\u2019m still not eating enough but at least I\u2019m not binge/fasting anymore which was hell",
