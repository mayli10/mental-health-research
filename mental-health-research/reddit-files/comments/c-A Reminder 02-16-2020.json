Thank you :) Now that I'm graduating and looking back on my transcript I can see exactly how my tendency to restrict when stressed affected my school performance (LW correlating with lowest drops in GPA, and same with HW, recovery attempts, and increases in GPA).

I said my ED would never effect my schooling, but I haven\u2019t studied once this week and have gone to bed almost as soon as I got home and had some serious 10 hour depression sleeps. I said my ED would never effect my job, but honestly I was a wreck yesterday and it was so hard for me to remember simple things, and not get extremely agitated with every inconvenience. I don\u2019t even have the energy to maintain any friendships or relationships right now, so those are falling apart as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nI used to be convinced that fasting and restricting helped me more than anything else when it came to focusing, and it was when I functioned the best. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019m getting older now, or because I have more responsibilities these days, but I\u2019m starting to realize that\u2019s a load of bullshit. \n\n\n\n\nBut hey I\u2019m losing weight so none of that other stuff matters, right \ud83d\ude43?",
