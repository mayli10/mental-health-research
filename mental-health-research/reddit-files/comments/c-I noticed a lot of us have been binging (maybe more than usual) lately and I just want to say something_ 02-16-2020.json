Thank you so much for the tips, I\u2019m going to the grocery store tomorrow and I\u2019m going to just buy tons and tons of veggies!! Do you have any recommendations for sauces/dressings or salad toppings? :D I usually have pretty plain salads if I\u2019m being honest. And thank you for including a shower as a nice thing for yourself. I know it sounds like something so simple that a lot of people do every day, but when it gets like this even finding the motivation to take care of myself like that slips away.

                            "Text": "Ahhhh you're so welcome!! I feel like anyone who struggles with food is a kindred spirit...we all just \"get\" it, you know? It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert. Sending you so much love!",

I know this is also bullshit, it\u2019s just the ED talking and saying I\u2019m happier when I have that level of control. I just want to get out of this rut. I\u2019m hoping cleaning the space around me and a new skincare routine will help get me in gear for getting back to where I should and want to be. I ate so much cheese today it should be illegal...",

Honestly what just got me out of my binge cycle was making sure I drank enough water, had enough protein, and allowing myself unlimited veggies to \"binge\" on.

                        "Text": "Ahhhh you're so welcome!! I feel like anyone who struggles with food is a kindred spirit...we all just \"get\" it, you know? It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert. Sending you so much love!",

                            "Text": "Ahhhh you're so welcome!! I feel like anyone who struggles with food is a kindred spirit...we all just \"get\" it, you know? It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert. Sending you so much love!",

Thank you so much for the tips, I\u2019m going to the grocery store tomorrow and I\u2019m going to just buy tons and tons of veggies!! Do you have any recommendations for sauces/dressings or salad toppings? :D I usually have pretty plain salads if I\u2019m being honest. And thank you for including a shower as a nice thing for yourself. I know it sounds like something so simple that a lot of people do every day, but when it gets like this even finding the motivation to take care of myself like that slips away.

                            "Text": "Ahhhh you're so welcome!! I feel like anyone who struggles with food is a kindred spirit...we all just \"get\" it, you know? It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert. Sending you so much love!",

Thank you so much for sharing and including the calories too \ud83d\ude22 \ud83d\udc9c I really do agree about feeling kinship when you know someone knows what this hell is like. I tried for so long to tell myself that it wasn\u2019t actually happening to me and that I had it all under control. I was just passionate and driven about these goals I couldn\u2019t even admit were unhealthy and unrealistic. But now I can admit it, and it\u2019s hard, but I believe we can all one day break free of this and so I hope you will find a day where you never have to think about it again. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to write responses to me about this. It felt really good to talk about it \ud83e\udd17 And I\u2019m sorry about the break up, but I\u2019m glad that you sound like you\u2019re back on your feet and you\u2019ll have many more happier days ahead! \ud83d\udc9c",

I know it sounds like something so simple that a lot of people do every day, but when it gets like this even finding the motivation to take care of myself like that slips away.

                            "Text": "Ahhhh you're so welcome!! I feel like anyone who struggles with food is a kindred spirit...we all just \"get\" it, you know? It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert. Sending you so much love!",

It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert. Sending you so much love!",

I wake up early and have super full days, so its a great motivator to get out of bed and get ready, since it FEELS amazing! I keep it in the freezer and clean it with alcohol (just in case?) before using. I moisturize then roll it on. While I have my coffee. Its the little things that keep me pushing, thats why I have so much self care shit.. just trying to stay consistent on a good path. I have so many weaknesses.. lets just try giving in here and there as treats. Have a most wonderful day <3",

                            "Text": "Ahhhh you're so welcome!! I feel like anyone who struggles with food is a kindred spirit...we all just \"get\" it, you know? It's so isolating and mentally tormenting to constantly be picking apart your body and the way people view you and analyzing what you put in your body versus how much you weigh, etc. My boyfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me so I also relate to not feeling like people love you as much anymore. But you know what? Now is the time you have to love yourself enough to go the extra mile and invest some time in making yourself feel good!! So yes, shower, lotion, face masks, candles, dim lights, Netflix, cozy blankets, movie nights, do all the nice things for yourself! Part of why we binge is because we feel empty inside, so try filling yourself up in other ways. Of course still eat and nourish your body but just be mindful of how you feel before you eat. And for the veggies, do you have access to an oven? I really love roasting up a bunch of cauliflower. I chop it first from the head into smaller chunks and put it on a baking sheet with some salt. If you've ever used nutritional yeast it's a topping they usually have in the spice section and it has a very cheesy flavor but only 20 calories per tablespoon and it's a probiotic with B12, too! I love seasoning with that. I like to dip the cauliflower in ketchup (maybe too weird, idk haha). I also love to steam a bunch of chopped carrots with sea salt on them and eat big bowls of those, but if you don't have a steamer you can either put the chopped carrots in a pan with about 0.5 inches water on the highest stove setting or put the carrots in a microwavable bowl for about 5 min in the microwave with the same amount of water in the bowl. Edamame is also super good if you get the steam able bag kind and it's usually 130 calories for a huge bag of it that you steam in the microwave for 5 min. Lastly I get cauliflower rice from the frozen aisle, microwave it for 5 min in the bag, and season it with nutritional yeast and everything but the bagel seasoning! I usually make an egg white omelet with turkey to put on top of the cauliflower rice (1 egg, 3 egg whites, a slice of turkey, green onion if you want) and a tablespoon of hummus on top. It's incredibly high volume and filling. If you're in the mood for something sweet, chopping an apple and seasoning it with cinnamon and baking it in the oven for 15 min at 425 degrees is EXCELLENT, or you can microwave frozen fruit for a couple minutes to have a pie-like dessert. Sending you so much love!",

I wake up early and have super full days, so its a great motivator to get out of bed and get ready, since it FEELS amazing! I keep it in the freezer and clean it with alcohol (just in case?) before using. I moisturize then roll it on. While I have my coffee. Its the little things that keep me pushing, thats why I have so much self care shit.. just trying to stay consistent on a good path. I have so many weaknesses.. lets just try giving in here and there as treats. Have a most wonderful day <3",

Thank you so much for sharing and including the calories too \ud83d\ude22 \ud83d\udc9c I really do agree about feeling kinship when you know someone knows what this hell is like. I tried for so long to tell myself that it wasn\u2019t actually happening to me and that I had it all under control. I was just passionate and driven about these goals I couldn\u2019t even admit were unhealthy and unrealistic. But now I can admit it, and it\u2019s hard, but I believe we can all one day break free of this and so I hope you will find a day where you never have to think about it again. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking the time to write responses to me about this. It felt really good to talk about it \ud83e\udd17 And I\u2019m sorry about the break up, but I\u2019m glad that you sound like you\u2019re back on your feet and you\u2019ll have many more happier days ahead! \ud83d\udc9c",
