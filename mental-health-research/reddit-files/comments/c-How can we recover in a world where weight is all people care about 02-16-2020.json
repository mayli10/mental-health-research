Of course I noticed it but I don't really have an opinion about it since it's her body and I don't care about other people's weight. Anyways, the day after I was in my bedroom and I could hear my relatives talking about this cousin in the other room and it just made me so upset. They were basically saying that they were all surprised because \"she was always so strict about food and always took care of herself\", which automatically makes me think she could have had/can have an ed (also because there was one episode, like 10 years ago, when she literally fainted because she was restricting). It's sad because it's someone in your own family and still all people care about is your fucking appearance.",

In answer to your question (perhaps was rhetorical, but I'll take the bait anyway), weight isn't what all people care about. Being healthy is important, which includes both sides of the weight spectrum. Being happy with your body, confident, and healthy enough to enjoy activities with people, is important. People are way more attracted to those who are happy and self-possessed than someone who is super thin and has a disorder. Maybe some assholes aren't. But you don't want to attract the wrong people in your life anyway, right? Being fatter than you'd like may exclude people who 'only care about weight' but being healthy will bring people who, in the long run, are healthier for you to have in your life. Best part? If you're actually able to find a way to be happy with your body, you won't care about the opinions of those who aren't worthy.",

Therefore, I relayed my experience.\n\nYou asked if I knew this was a subreddit for EDs. That implies I don\u2019t understand ED or have one,\n\nMy BMI is relevant to my post and to my ED. Why does it bother you that I said it twice when it was relevant? Even if I am fixated on my weight, do you know this is a subreddit for eating disorders?\n\nOh Great Gatekeeper of ED, you can chill with the demand for my medical history.

I\u2019ve since dropped a considerable amount of weight but he says he wants me back to what I weighed in high school because it was \u201chealthier.\u201d I am 6 ft tall and before I gained weight I was 130 lbs (BMI of 17.63 according to a website I just used- don\u2019t know how to calculate that on my own). I was very underweight and could see sooo many bones (which I never found to be \u201cgoals\u201d until I developed an ED due to my parents CONSTANTLY badgering and insulting me about it). Now I\u2019m in the normal BMI category and can\u2019t stop focusing on my weight because according to my dad I\u2019m not thin enough until I\u2019m underweight. It\u2019s so rough that that\u2019s the only value he places on me, not that I got a degree and have a decent job related to my field. Not that I\u2019ve been living on my own and paying my own bills since I was 19. Not that I\u2019m getting married next year. Just my weight.

I\u2019ve been bulimic for nearly 10 years now and granted my family don\u2019t know but I managed two weeks where I actually ate a sandwich for lunch at the end of September/start of October. My partner was super supportive and proud - I really struggled as I knew I\u2019d put on a bit of weight but my SO kept working at distracting me. \n\nCame on holiday last week with him and the family. Grandmother\u2019s first comment when I went out in my costume: oh...how much weight have you put on? \nI said \u2018who said I\u2019ve put any on\u2019 \nHer reply: \u2018I do. There\u2019s no point denying it. Are you actually happy with that?\u2019 \n\nI\u2019d only put 7lbs on...and that was actually over about 3/4 months. But that one comment undid everything. I\u2019ve been out round the pool in sarongs/towels, wearing really loose closures to \u2018cover up\u2019 and no meal has been purge free. \n\nI know it\u2019s probably silly to let one comment ruin the small step I\u2019d made. Logical me knows that. But that\nComment is now ingrained and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. \n\nSorry. Went off on a tangent from the original post there - guess I needed a vent :( but yeah, it\u2019s ridiculous how obsessed people are with weight...it\u2019s so ingrained into society now we need a deep clean of everything to get it out, but who knows how to do that.\n\nIt sucks.",

Therefore, I relayed my experience.\n\nYou asked if I knew this was a subreddit for EDs. That implies I don\u2019t understand ED or have one,\n\nMy BMI is relevant to my post and to my ED. Why does it bother you that I said it twice when it was relevant? Even if I am fixated on my weight, do you know this is a subreddit for eating disorders?\n\nOh Great Gatekeeper of ED, you can chill with the demand for my medical history.
