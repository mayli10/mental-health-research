It\u2019s not a gender dysphoria issue for me, it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t see boobs as anything other than sacks of fat and I simply don\u2019t want that grossness on my body! I associate near-nonexistent boobs with skinniness, and at the moment mine are so small I don\u2019t bother with a bra half the time *and I LOVE it*.... my husband, however, is significantly less keen on the lack of boobage lol \ud83d\ude02",
