                    "Text": "Remembering what you enjoyed in life before your eating disorder is SUCH a huge part of recovery. While recovery is certainly going to take a lot of conscious mental effort, part of it is training yourself to think about things other than food, even if you're thinking about it in the context of recovery. I had a wakeup call not long before I finally committed to recovering fully when I went to see Mamma Mia 2 with my sister. In the days before I had been asking myself that exact same question; what did I think about and enjoy before AN? After going to see the movie (which had been preceded by 24 hours of fasting and a two-mile run so that I had wouldn't feel guilty about having dinner out), I realized that these were the kind of things that brought me joy before -- singing, dancing, spending time with friends and family. Not being curled up in my bed at 7:30 PM (having a restrictive eating disorder is freaking exhausting), trying to figure out exactly how many calories were in a medium-sized Granny Smith apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the best things you can do for yourself in recovery is rediscover those things that bring you joy. True joy and not the temporary catharsis that you get from having satisfied your eating disorder brain. And if you can't remember what it was like to not have an eating disorder (because that's totally possible), commit to finding those things that give you joy.",

People ask me why at my ages I dont have kids which makes me think of how much of a bad parent I would be because I might toss my recentment towards my child and thats not fair. I dont know.
