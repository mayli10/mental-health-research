It's not normal yet no one bats an eye lid, not even my brother. \n\n\nAnd he's said many times that food doesn't interest him and that's why he doesn't eat (except for if my step mum makes a dinner, and her meals usually come between 400 and 800 calories) and saves it for a pizza on the weekend. \n\nI don't think it's normal.",

They just say when hungry or at meal and then stop when appropriate and move on to their next task in life. I always ALWAYS assume that everyone else thinks as much about food as I do.
