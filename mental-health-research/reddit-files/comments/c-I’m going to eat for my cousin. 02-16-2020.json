She told me her heart gets crushed when she hears about the disordered things I did. \n\nI've made some progress and it's worth it every day, still not perfect but better than before.  I still dont fully feel like I'm doing this for my self, but now I do care a bit more because I feel happy about the little progress I've made.\n\nWhatever you do, I'm proud of u for taking a step!!
