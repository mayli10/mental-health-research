And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health.

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

                    "Text": ">From what I understand actual professionals who advocate fasting only recommend it for people above a healthy weight who have no history of disordered eating. \n\nI'm so sick of people recommending fasting subs to overweight and obese people like it's a cure all. A great percentage of people who are obese comfort eat or have full blown BED. A significant portion of people with food addiction that try and fail to fast will just binge even worse because it's another way they've failed to lose the weight and they comfort eat to feel better. Ask me how I know. I successfully did IF and extended fasts for about 10 months. But once I fell off, I never got back on fully. It's just be a binge and restrict cycle ever since. But I still have the expectation I can do it like I used to. Every single morning I wake up telling myself I won't eat until dinner, or at all today. When I eventually do, no matter how low-calorie, my day is ruined and I'm irritable for the rest of it because I hate myself. Because I ate an apple to take my medication with.\n\nIt promotes the incredibly harmful black and white attitude that so many people with eating disorders have. I feel like a lot of people, if not most people here struggle with the \"if I fail my eating plan, everything is ruined and I'm a failure\". Some deal with that by restricting more, some deal with that feeling by eating more (and possibly also purging it in some way).\n\nI'm sure if they saw my perspective they'd roll their eyes and think I'm just not committed enough and don't have enough self-discipline. Which, even if that's true, that line of is literally Pro-Ana Tips 101.\n\nIt gets me so stupid heated. Even more so because deep down I can't help but feel like I'm just mad about it because I've gained a significant amount of weight recently even though I know rationally that nothing about fasting is mentally healthy in the long run. Not eating is as addictive as eating too much and will kill you just like any other addiction if it's left untreated.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health.

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health.

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

They even post photos of their sad meals and it's all upvoted. You could take posts from that subreddit and repost it into a pro ana forum and it would fit 100%. Only difference is that at least people on the ED forums are aware of the fact that their eating habits are disordered.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

                        "Text": "Would like to see the post, I searched for pickles but didn\u2019t know which one. I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health.

I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health.

I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff.

It can be beneficial if you\u2019re able to fully control your fast. A big part of disordered eating is the obsessive part of it, so I think it\u2019s possible to consciously fast without becoming obsessive and remaining healthy. \n\nHaving said that, many people in that sub exhibit really disordered behaviors. \n\nAt least in proED we called it like it is, which allowed other users to give harm reduction advice.

I like this subreddit and I don't think it contains anything really that upsetting like the fasting one, but imo I don't think the reddit admins will see it that way. There probably are plenty of people with EDs who don't currently look at *this* sub because they find it upsetting/harmful, but I wouldn't want them to report it because I personally find it helpful - maybe there is something the /r/fasting people are getting out of that subreddit too (beyond all the damaging behaviours that seems like they could develop there...).",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",

If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health.

And I was in denial forever that that was the case, swearing I would get back into it. \n\nI personally don't think IF was what made my weight loss successful in that time, it was cutting out most carbs and sugar because I finally had regular blood sugar after a lifetime of living on junk while having insulin resistance. If anything, the more I fasted, the more that screwed things up because having one meal a day was a lot for my body to process in one go. I don't recommend keto or anything like that, but definitely cutting out unnecessary sugar and sticking to low-Gi foods helps with cravings. If REALLY fucked with my emotions too. I'd be euphoric to the point of tearing up then an hour later I'd be clenching my jaw in anger over something like a dog barking too loud outside. Fasting and restriction in general messes with your hormones and there's a lot of people who can't afford to have their hormones messed with like that because it will screw with their mental health. I am definitely one of those.",

I think it\u2019s confusing because there are people out there than can use fasting as a tool and not develop an eating disorder. I think it\u2019s one of the few things that works for a certain group of people. However for people with eating disorders the idea of fasting is like a bomb, extremely triggering. I can see both sides of it. \n\nI went thru extreme grief and tragedy and have ptsd because of it so if I hear the word suicide, I immediately have an issue. Or if I hear certain screaming, I picture my dad dying. \u201cNormal\u201d people don\u2019t have this reaction. I understand because I have this issue with it that it\u2019s going to affect me way differently. \n\nFor people that can fast and get away from an unhealthy place of overeating or depression, fasting can be positive. But for people with ed it\u2019s basically the opposite, fasting behaviors exacerbate depression and food obsession. I\u2019m way healthier mentally and physically since I started fasting although basically no one thought my method was smart or healthy.\n\nHonestly the most rage inducing thing I\u2019ve seen on r fasting is people pushing the extremely low carb thing on there. I think it\u2019s super unhealthy and problematic. Maybe I\u2019m biased in that that triggered me and not the other stuff. I haven\u2019t seen that level of ed encouragement, and if I did see it I would agree with u.",
