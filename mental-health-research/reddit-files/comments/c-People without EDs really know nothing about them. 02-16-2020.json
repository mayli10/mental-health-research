They never did anything about it. Then when I told my mom I was suicidal and STILL starving myself, she refused to take me to the doctor. She said a normal doctor will just want to give me pills. Once I was crying at a fast food restaurant because I didn\u2019t want to eat out and I was frustrated and just wanted to go home and eat the food there (I honestly wasn\u2019t going to eat but I was going to make them think I did), my mom said \u201cI wish you\u2019d just get over it\u201d. After that, I just hid it from them. I thought I had it under control for a while but I didn\u2019t. Then I got really bad again. I didn\u2019t get help until this year. My parents are lucky I made it this far and they didn\u2019t end up with a dead teenager.",

She just used to be much thinner, menopause hit her, and now she's desperate). I've tried to talk to her about CICO in a veeeery healthy way (can't bust my own ass in the process lmao) but it's like talking to a wall. I guess she'll just go back to begging her doctor to hook her up with sibutramine and eat nothing but two pieces of toast (whole wheat, of course lmao) and two yoghurts a day \ud83e\udd37\n\nAlso, please eat your pizza guilt free, bb \ud83d\udc9c",
