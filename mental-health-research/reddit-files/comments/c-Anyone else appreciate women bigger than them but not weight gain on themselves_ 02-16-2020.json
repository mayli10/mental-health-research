One set of standards for them, completely different standards for myself.\n\nThe only rational explanation I can provide for preferring myself thin is that I remember what it felt like to be in my body at my HW. I was overweight and it sucked. \n\nI hated the chub rub. I hated not being able to swing my arms freely because the sweaty skin of my upper arms stuck to my torso if I wore a tank top. I hated my boobs getting up to a D cup so I couldn't comfortably go braless. I hated the underboob situation, hated feeling my boobs fold over and stick to my abdomen.\n\nBasically, everything felt wrong. After writing all that out, apparently I have some kind of issue with different body parts touching? All those sensations were beyond annoying. They made my skin crawl, especially the one about my arms sticking to my sides.\n\nBut maybe my perception of those sensations was itself disordered, idk.",
