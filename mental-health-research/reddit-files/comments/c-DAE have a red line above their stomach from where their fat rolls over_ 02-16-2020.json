Your stomach has extra skin so that it doesn't... you know... rip open when you bend your spine the other way.\n\nJust look at contortionists. Even though they're all thin, their stomachs are staying in one piece even when bending their spine back to a ridiculous degree. It's because of that extra skin.\n\nIf you keep your back straight while sitting you'll be less likely to get that little imprint though. Or at least less pronounced :)\n\nedit: another example is, when you stick your arm out straight, you'll feel soft, loose skin on your elbow. When you fold your arm in (like if you were going to strike someone with your elbow- sorry for the weirdly violent example lmao) then you can feel the skin is perfectly taut and smooth. Same idea. There has to be extra skin there so your elbow doesn't rip when you fold in your arm.",
