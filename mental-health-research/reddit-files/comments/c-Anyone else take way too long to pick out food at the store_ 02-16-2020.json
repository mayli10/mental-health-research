                "Text": "I've spent hours at the grocery store only to buy like 4 things. Often.\nI can't drive, so when I lived with my now-ex gf, she would drive us to the store and then she'd chill in the car while I shopped. It got to the point where I'd just walk to the store from the apartment and she'd pick me up (if necessary) once I'd checked out, because I felt so bad that she had to wait for so long. She knew about my ED and she was really supportive but... Still. And she couldn't even come in with me because my ED brain would flip the fuck out because I had to be Unobserved\u2122, apparently.\nI have to go through basically aaaaall the aisles, other than the bread and junk food aisles. Put one or two things in the cart. Get a third thing. Put back whichever one has the most calories per serving, unless it's something with a really good protein-to-calorie ratio. Wash, rinse, repeat. Obsessively read every single goddamn nutrition label if this is the first time I'm getting this particular food, like when I started eating oatmeal. So much reading. Fuckin hell. So many oatmeal varieties. Oatmeal alone took me about 45 mins, at least.\n\nAlso heavily relate to the pacing and the crisis every 2 minutes, ugh.\n\nUnless I'm in a period of super low restriction, and thus am only able to regularly eat about 5 foods total, it takes me YEARS in the grocery store. Still takes me a while in the aforementioned periods though, bc there's always a big chunk of \"hey should I actually get this thing, or this other thing\" \"hey should I buy a different variety of this thing\", etc. \n\ntldr; YEP, TAKES ME YEARS, SUCKS ASS, SORRY FOR THE NOVEL, EATING DISORDERS ARE SO FUCKIN TIME CONSUMING OH MY GOD",
