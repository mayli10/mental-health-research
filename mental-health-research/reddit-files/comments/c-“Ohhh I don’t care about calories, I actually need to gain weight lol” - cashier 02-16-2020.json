So over you pricks man.\n\nEdit: ive torn into asshole here for shitting on everyone because somehow having an ED makes you special and you're immune to judgement. You do understand there are fucking people who need to gain weight. Being skinny isn't great for fucking everyone. Shit. We can get super skinny and not be happy for shit. Those people probably DO NEED WEIGHT  to ge healthy. This sub and the people in it need a real fucking reality check. We are just as obnoxious and annoying as anyone else.\nJust because we hate our bodies and try to destroy it doesnt mean we shit on people wanting to get better.",
