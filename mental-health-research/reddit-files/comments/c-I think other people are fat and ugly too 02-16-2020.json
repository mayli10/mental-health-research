I just didn't care that much. And when I did take notice, I usually found most people to be beautiful in their own way. I also had a pretty healthy body image and generally liked the way I looked.\n\nSince my ED developed and I started calorie counting, however, I've found that I suddenly formed an awareness of my body that I never had, as well as this sort of messed up dysmorphia where I look at old pictures of myself at a near-healthy BMI (always been on the lanky side)  and think I look big. Other people who I used to consider unhealthily thin now either look normal to me or even large. It is seriously disturbing; before a few months ago I never had this issue and it's really messed with my head.",

I just didn't care that much. And when I did take notice, I usually found most people to be beautiful in their own way. I also had a pretty healthy body image and generally liked the way I looked.\n\nSince my ED developed and I started calorie counting, however, I've found that I suddenly formed an awareness of my body that I never had, as well as this sort of messed up dysmorphia where I look at old pictures of myself at a near-healthy BMI (always been on the lanky side)  and think I look big. Other people who I used to consider unhealthily thin now either look normal to me or even large. It is seriously disturbing; before a few months ago I never had this issue and it's really messed with my head.",

I also had a pretty healthy body image and generally liked the way I looked.\n\nSince my ED developed and I started calorie counting, however, I've found that I suddenly formed an awareness of my body that I never had, as well as this sort of messed up dysmorphia where I look at old pictures of myself at a near-healthy BMI (always been on the lanky side)  and think I look big. Other people who I used to consider unhealthily thin now either look normal to me or even large.

I also had a pretty healthy body image and generally liked the way I looked.\n\nSince my ED developed and I started calorie counting, however, I've found that I suddenly formed an awareness of my body that I never had, as well as this sort of messed up dysmorphia where I look at old pictures of myself at a near-healthy BMI (always been on the lanky side)  and think I look big. Other people who I used to consider unhealthily thin now either look normal to me or even large.

I get a mentality of \"weight loss isn't hard, just eat less, I'm friggin disabled if I can do it you can too\" even though I realize that people are different and what I'm doing is obviously unhealthy and has done long-term damage to my body. I realized that I don't really see my friends or people I know and care about like this, just random people I don't know. Like, if I don't know their life, I can judge them or something. So I've started trying to work with the mentality of \"they're doing the best they can in life with what they can do at the moment.\" That way, it's not as focused on weight or shape either and doesn't have to do specifically with food/weight/losing/etc. (because I realize realistically not everyone actually wants to lose weight all the time).",

But there's part of me that still likes being the smallest and thinnest.\n\nWhen it comes to judging other people, strangers, I used to have so much compassion when I was much younger, probably because I related to \"being fat\" (even though I wasn't) in my head. Now, though, having slowly shifted from EDNOS to R-AN / orthorexia, it's like my tolerance has worn out? I'm no longer struggling to lose weight; I've lost it \u2014 and I don't feel any better about myself. I almost resent people who are oblivious and okay with themselves as they are, since I'm constantly torturing myself.

I also had a pretty healthy body image and generally liked the way I looked.\n\nSince my ED developed and I started calorie counting, however, I've found that I suddenly formed an awareness of my body that I never had, as well as this sort of messed up dysmorphia where I look at old pictures of myself at a near-healthy BMI (always been on the lanky side)  and think I look big.

Makes me kind of happy in a terrible way.\n\nAlso (I'm an awful person continue reading at your own caution lol) a couple months ago my friend who also has an ED and I were out for dinner and clubbing with a club promoter and a big group of girls. It was one of the first times we had gone out since we had both lost a lot of weight. The promoter offered to drive just the two of us and one other girl while the rest of the group walked to the second location and gave us lots of special attention. I whispered to her, \"wow, he really likes us\", and she responded \"well, we're the hottest girls here\". I looked around and realized it was true. When I was on the big end of normal weight I never experienced being the \"hot girl\". Now whenever I'm in a room (school class, lsat class, a social gathering), I'll look around to check if I'm the thinnest girl there.",

The problem is when we pat eachother on the back for being shitty, and don\u2019t encourage the best in eachother, and actively bring out the worst. ",
