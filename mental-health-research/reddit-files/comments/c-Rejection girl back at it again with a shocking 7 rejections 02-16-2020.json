Plus I know their engineering program is really tough (as it should be) and is one of those programs where the teacher says \u201clook to your left and right.  At least one of those people will not be graduating with you due to the difficulty of this program.\u201d It really prepares you for tough careers in the real world.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do great, have a fun experience, and be ready to hit the ground running when you graduate.

Plus I know their engineering program is really tough (as it should be) and is one of those programs where the teacher says \u201clook to your left and right.  At least one of those people will not be graduating with you due to the difficulty of this program.\u201d It really prepares you for tough careers in the real world.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do great, have a fun experience, and be ready to hit the ground running when you graduate.

                        "Text": "VT as a safety school??  I just read that the average GPA of an attending student is 3.95!  Plus I know their engineering program is really tough (as it should be) and is one of those programs where the teacher says \u201clook to your left and right.  At least one of those people will not be graduating with you due to the difficulty of this program.\u201d It really prepares you for tough careers in the real world.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do great, have a fun experience, and be ready to hit the ground running when you graduate.  I honestly believe in fate and know that this school is where you are meant to go to have the best future possible.  Be excited and love your new university!",

I'm two years past my college graduation now, and looking back I don't know why everyone was acting like admission to an Ivy was the end all be all. It's a short-sighted way to raise children.

Regardless I understand the disappointment of not getting into your first choice. \n\nAnecdotally, five years ago my SO and I were supposed to move from our home country to Portland, OR for his work, but at the last minute the US clamped down on visas and we ended up having to move with very little notice to Vancouver, BC instead. It was really stressful and we were completely unfamiliar with the city of with Canada, which was anxiety-inducing because we\u2019d spent so long familiarising ourselves with Oregon and the US. We\u2019ve been here for five years now and I am head over heels hopelessly in love with this city. I can\u2019t imagine ever living anywhere else. \n\nI hope it works out similarly for you with VT!

At least one of those people will not be graduating with you due to the difficulty of this program.\u201d It really prepares you for tough careers in the real world.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do great, have a fun experience, and be ready to hit the ground running when you graduate.

Don't feel badly about not being the cream of the weanling crop, unless your daddy's an alum. The employment rates postgrad don't justify the loans.\n\nIt's a $50,000 status symbol more than an investment: unless you're aiming for a specific program, offered at a specific school, for specific reasons, and know that it's worth the price tag. Or if you're willing to gamble on the networking options hooking you up afterwards.\n\nA tech school like vt is exactly where you want to be in the long run right now. Especially if your long term plans are IT-related in any way. Look into internship programs. Work experience before graduation is worth its weight in gold. (This isn't as relevant since you're going into neuroscience tho; we have really different fields!)\n\nCongratulations and good luck!",

Plus I know their engineering program is really tough (as it should be) and is one of those programs where the teacher says \u201clook to your left and right.  At least one of those people will not be graduating with you due to the difficulty of this program.\u201d It really prepares you for tough careers in the real world.\n\nYou\u2019re going to do great, have a fun experience, and be ready to hit the ground running when you graduate.

It\u2019s not so much that the curriculum is the best, just that it\u2019s location and facilities are really good.  Keep your focus on your career and you\u2019re going to be so glad you went to Virginia Tech!",

To tell you the honest truth, once you get out of high school, no one \"in the real world\" (god I hate that phrase) gives two shits about where you went to school. It might get you an \"in\" in a few types of industries if you're well-connected, but your general attitude goes a hell of a lot of a farther than where you went to school. I was the same in high school, thinking I had to do an ivy or my life would be over, but that mindset is seriously shortsighted. Serious congrats on getting accepted to VT, you'll do great, just like you obviously already have been. Keep up the good work! Don't strive to be someone else's best, follow the road that's best for you. If you ever have any questions or want to talk, hit me up! ",
