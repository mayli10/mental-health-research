I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",

I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",

I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",

I don\u2019t have a degree or anything (psych/neuro is what I went to school for), but it drives me BONKERS when people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about and act like anybody who disagrees isn\u2019t enlightened. I\u2019ve learned to not talk to people about this though, because they get super defensive when they learn their extreme diet isn\u2019t actually that great for you or isn\u2019t effective. I swear, some people are just hooked on dieting, lol\n\nPaleo is the #1 thing that \u201cgrinds my gears\u201d with such. Like.... nothing. About. That. Diet. Makes. Sense.",

I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",

I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",

Or he really just can\u2019t judge weight, I mean how many guys are good at that kind of thing? They don\u2019t really know what underweight looks like.

I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",

Just tell him that you want to be transparent, and that while diets may work for him to stay happy/healthy, diets for you \"just backfire and end up being so unhealthy\" or that \"you're trying to do that positive energy thing so you don't talk about your body size with people and focus on how you feel\"? Girl, put him in his place - he doesn't need to agree or even understand where you're coming from! Nor do you need to tell him everything, if you don't want to. He just needs to respect you, and your boundaries. If you put some boundaries regarding your body and eating in place from day 1, and he respects them, you'll know he's a keeper. If he can't help but comment on women's bodies & it's more important to him than you? Dump his ass like a flaming hot potato, fresh out of the oven.\n\nWith most of my partners, I would tell them about my eating disorder. Not on the first date or two, but eventually, after a few, I would tell them that I have a history of ED's, and that while I was in recovery, respecting my boundary of not talking about my food choices was something they had to respect, moving forward. My only boyfriend who couldn't do that ended up being an emotionally and physically abusive narcissist, whom tried to fake an ED for attention.\n\nAlso - deep down, if it doesn't feel right or is really off-putting? Listen. to. your. gut. I firmly believe that our brain processes non-verbal, tone of voice, etc., cues that we don't consciously process, but are worth storing, which produces those \"something just isn't right\" feelings. If it feels invasive or \"wrong\" for him to comment on your body  on the 1st date, don't be scared to listen to your gut and tell him that you guys weren't a good match. No shame in standing up for yourself and staying safe/happy!",

I am unfamiliar with how limiting your carbohydrates so stringently influences insulin (not a major topic in animal/livestock nutrition), but what i can tell you is that eating a diet that is consistently high in fat influences reproductive ability. In sows (thats a female pig) fed a diet high in fat (DDGS was a component of the diet, incrementally increasing between trial groups) had ooyctes that were not viable, as there was increased lipid deposition. Lipid molecules were literally replacing carbohydrate based molecules in the oocyte. Carbohydrates are easily broken down for cellular respiration and cellular function, so it makes sense why there would need ot be a high concentration in oocytes (although sperms are basically 100% genetic information and therefore protein, ejaculate is basically a high concentration of carbohydrates which the sperm are able to use as energy sources for mobilization... oh the joys of animal breeding and reproductive science!)",
