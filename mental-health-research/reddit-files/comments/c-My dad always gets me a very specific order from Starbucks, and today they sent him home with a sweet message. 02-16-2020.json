I know she felt terrible ordering it because she didn't want to seem bitchy while trying to make it right. \n\nShe always came in during my shift, so I told her I'd put a check on the cup if it was perfect and made by me or someone I trust. I put a sticky note near the drink syrups with the exact numbers written down and where the soda should end on the cup, etc.\n\nI knew too well how stressful it is putting the control in someone else's hands, so I did my best.

I\u2019m super addicted to my local Starbucks drive thru but usually stick to Americanos or black unsweetened iced coffees (no classic). Sometimes I do bring my own unsweetened almond milk + stevia to add tho. \ud83d\ude05\n\nI had *no idea* I could order anything with any kind of milk already in there...that actually tastes good...and is in that cal range?!! W h a t. I\u2019ve tried a couple sf syrups in black coffee though, and your standard drink truly does sound delightful! Mind blown. Damn, I can\u2019t wait to try some variation of it. (Like I may or may not have just immediately confirmed that it\u2019s around 50 cals in the US website\u2019s nutritional calculator, haha\u2014and 3g net carbs for when I\u2019m Not Doing Carbs, wow!!!!!)
