Making EDs out to be just a bad diet suggest that you can help some with an ED just by changing/fixing their diet and saying all of that \"just eat\" bs.

The worst part is everyone wants to talk about EDs in a stereotypical, simplified and just plain false manner, but the truth about what we go through is so stigmatized. No one wants to talk about what it's really like, they just want to blame social media or diet culture and act like they're making changes and being supportive.  \n\nWe can ban Instagram and diet/weight loss media, and condemn diet culture all day everyday, I'm still going to have an ED.

The discrimination between the two is clear; those who use over/under eating for a coping mechanism obviously don\u2019t fall within those who freely and voluntarily choose an unhealthy lifestyle then are shocked when the associated health problems come shortly thereafter, all the while shaming and ridiculing those with under-eating disorders, save for hashtag week.

Does that mean alcohol alone is the cause and toxic to everyone? No. Does it mean you would have had problems in a sober culture? Maybe, maybe not. Who knows. At that point though, going on a crusade against alcohol does nothing but make you seem like an asshat. Eating disorders I feel like are treated the same- except people are going on a crusade against diet culture, and using EDs as a platform to fight such, which just doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI feel like eating disorders (especially with the HAES community) are merely another chance to get on the \u201cdieting is bad\u201d soapbox. People don\u2019t seem to genuinely care, which is the case with a lot of issues really. How can we tell? Look at ED treatment, and how there has been such little improvement on (1) how we treat them (2) research on EDs in general in comparison to other MH conditions of their frequency and (3) the fact that we don\u2019t take people with EDs seriously, until it literally looks like they\u2019re about to die, and even then it\u2019s a hit or miss because we think harassing them to eat a cheese burger will cure them!",

At that point though, going on a crusade against alcohol does nothing but make you seem like an asshat.

Companies know, companies don't care - if it's cheaper to deny and hide evidence than change, they will resist change. \n\nRemember, corporations are legal fictional placeholders for people - people whose sole motivation is profit maximization. They can't feel guilt or shame, so don't humanize them. Taco Bell literally invented the term \"fourth meal\" and promoted it to normalize the idea that you should go out after dinner and eat another 800+ calories. Don't ever give companies the benefit of the doubt when the shitty thing they do is profitable but harmful.",

At that point though, going on a crusade against alcohol does nothing but make you seem like an asshat.

Companies know, companies don't care - if it's cheaper to deny and hide evidence than change, they will resist change. \n\nRemember, corporations are legal fictional placeholders for people - people whose sole motivation is profit maximization. They can't feel guilt or shame, so don't humanize them. Taco Bell literally invented the term \"fourth meal\" and promoted it to normalize the idea that you should go out after dinner and eat another 800+ calories.

They can't feel guilt or shame, so don't humanize them. Taco Bell literally invented the term \"fourth meal\" and promoted it to normalize the idea that you should go out after dinner and eat another 800+ calories.

It's mental, its physical, and its a way of internalizing things weve picked up along the way and people die from it every day, fat & thin. If someone was so overweight it hurt them to walk, their doctors repeatedly warning them about amputations, feeling like society ridicules them, full of shame and trapped in their own bodies, unable to do what they want to do, crippled by a disease they *think* that they deserve... i dont think they would choose that.\n\n     \nI know youre mainly having a dig at ignorant people and im totally with you on that first part, i just think its important to remember the scope and complexity of eating disorders.",

At that point though, going on a crusade against alcohol does nothing but make you seem like an asshat.

                "Text": "I frankly think a lot of mainstream eating behavior is disordered, but since it's profitable for large businesses, it's normalized, even fetishized somewhat by the media.\n\nSimilarly, MANY for-profit diet plans that are \"sold\" (either thru purchased supplements/foods, thru purchased support groups, thru purchased access to methodology, etc.) rely on unsustainable, somewhat disordered eating patterns. \n\nThus, it's somewhat of a meaningless tautology to say \"dieting increases your risk of ED,\" because many for-profit diets promote ED behavior. After all, they lose you as a customer if you have a truly comfortable, sustainable relationship with food. If anything, they are priming you for the next thing they want to sell you. it's conditioning, both from the food and diet industry, to keep you a customer for life. Just like the pharmaceutical industry - it's much more profitable to MANAGE diabetes with a lifetime of blood glucose monitoring and medication than it is to CURE diabetes.\n\nTelling me \"you're 18x more likely to have ED behavior if you go on a diet is like telling me that people who go outside are at an 18X risk of sun exposure. It might be true, but it's sort of dumb, and not useful information, and I still gotta go outside, and maybe a small amount of sun exposure, monitored and controlled, is actually normal?\n\nI bristle pretty aggressively at the medical community's hypercompartmentalization of ED acknowledgment and treatment, too. you can have the most devastatingly upsetting relationship with food, but only after certain physical markers occur (e.g. your weight gets too low or too high, you initiate self-harm behavior) do they snap into action and intervene and take you seriously, often months or years after the dangerous patterns have had a chance to take hold and become \"normal\" of \"comfortable\" for the person suffering.\n\nI'll also say - maybe lots of those people going on diets already had ED or ED behavior. maybe going on a diet just makes you 18x more likely to acknowledge that you've had an ED all along, since most/almost all diets include acknowledging, focusing on, and attempting to change your relationship/behavior surrounding food. \n\n\nLastly, making a person feel bad about themselves or their plan is a CLASSIC, Don Draper-style tactic to convince you to buy what someone is selling. they may only be \"selling\" an ideology or an Instagram they want you to follow, but it's still emotional abuse to get you to do what THEY think is right by making you feel bad about what YOU think is right. I don't know what part of \"my body, my choice\" some folks don't seem to get, when they scream it from the rooftops when promoting their HAES narrative but then get all up in our business about managing the way we feel is best.\n\nEnd rant.",

Companies know, companies don't care - if it's cheaper to deny and hide evidence than change, they will resist change. \n\nRemember, corporations are legal fictional placeholders for people - people whose sole motivation is profit maximization. They can't feel guilt or shame, so don't humanize them. Taco Bell literally invented the term \"fourth meal\" and promoted it to normalize the idea that you should go out after dinner and eat another 800+ calories.

At that point though, going on a crusade against alcohol does nothing but make you seem like an asshat.

Making EDs out to be just a bad diet suggest that you can help some with an ED just by changing/fixing their diet and saying all of that \"just eat\" bs. People diet to lose weight for their appearance or health, that's NOT what someone with an ED does! It's really annoying. The worst part is everyone wants to talk about EDs in a stereotypical, simplified and just plain false manner, but the truth about what we go through is so stigmatized. No one wants to talk about what it's really like, they just want to blame social media or diet culture and act like they're making changes and being supportive.  \n\nWe can ban Instagram and diet/weight loss media, and condemn diet culture all day everyday, I'm still going to have an ED.

Making EDs out to be just a bad diet suggest that you can help some with an ED just by changing/fixing their diet and saying all of that \"just eat\" bs. People diet to lose weight for their appearance or health, that's NOT what someone with an ED does! It's really annoying. The worst part is everyone wants to talk about EDs in a stereotypical, simplified and just plain false manner, but the truth about what we go through is so stigmatized. No one wants to talk about what it's really like, they just want to blame social media or diet culture and act like they're making changes and being supportive.  \n\nWe can ban Instagram and diet/weight loss media, and condemn diet culture all day everyday, I'm still going to have an ED.

Companies know, companies don't care - if it's cheaper to deny and hide evidence than change, they will resist change. \n\nRemember, corporations are legal fictional placeholders for people - people whose sole motivation is profit maximization. They can't feel guilt or shame, so don't humanize them. Taco Bell literally invented the term \"fourth meal\" and promoted it to normalize the idea that you should go out after dinner and eat another 800+ calories.

Making EDs out to be just a bad diet suggest that you can help some with an ED just by changing/fixing their diet and saying all of that \"just eat\" bs. People diet to lose weight for their appearance or health, that's NOT what someone with an ED does! It's really annoying. The worst part is everyone wants to talk about EDs in a stereotypical, simplified and just plain false manner, but the truth about what we go through is so stigmatized. No one wants to talk about what it's really like, they just want to blame social media or diet culture and act like they're making changes and being supportive.  \n\nWe can ban Instagram and diet/weight loss media, and condemn diet culture all day everyday, I'm still going to have an ED.
