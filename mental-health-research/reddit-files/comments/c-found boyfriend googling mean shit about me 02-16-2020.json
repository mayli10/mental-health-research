Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love.

Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love.

Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love.

Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love.

His mom and sister have both had gastric bypass and breast implants (his sister was only 15 when she had those things done). My bf is a self proclaimed \u201cass guy\u201d (as opposed to a boob guy) so I didn\u2019t see it coming and I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s a total deal breaker, since he\u2019s.. definitely not UNhappy. It\u2019s just confusing for me, as someone who as always fixated on being smaller in every sense, to be told they\u2019re too small. I don\u2019t focus on it, because frankly I\u2019d rather live a shorter,  more confident life, than a long unsatisfied one. I probably make no sense.

Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love.

Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love.

Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love.

Many women successfully have breast augmentation surgery, but I implore you to look up breast implant illness - it\u2019s not 100% conclusively proven to be a \u2018thing\u2019, but the evidence is there. Women are having severe autoimmune reactions, wherein the body begins to attack itself **constantly** through inflammatory responses because of the breast implant. \n\nIt\u2019s not guaranteed to happen by any means, but be careful with what you do to yourself in the name of love. Take care of yourself gorgeous!",

It\u2019s just confusing for me, as someone who as always fixated on being smaller in every sense, to be told they\u2019re too small. I don\u2019t focus on it, because frankly I\u2019d rather live a shorter,  more confident life, than a long unsatisfied one. I probably make no sense. Don\u2019t mind me\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I went from an A to small B cup all the way up to H because of breastfeeding; never wanted a big chest and I hate them so much.  If you think you have any sag now, the weight of bigger breasts makes them fall even lower.  Plus it\u2019s super hard to exercise without your chest pulling/sliding all around (painful and makes sag worse).  Worst of all, if you love clothing, they make buying clothing a nightmare\u2014those size XS clothes that used to fit now can\u2019t stretch over your chest and you have to wear size M or L which is huge around the waist so even tees look like they need to be tailored.\n\nAlso, anyone that would rag on your body for any reason besides health and hygiene is *not* someone you want to be with.  I don\u2019t know how you didn\u2019t immediately respond with \u201cif you want someone who looks like that, then I\u2019m not the person you want to be with.\u201d",
