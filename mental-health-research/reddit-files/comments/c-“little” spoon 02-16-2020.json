It's not so much loving your body but believing your SO that he adores yours, even if you can't see it.\n\nI struggled a lot with him seeing me naked at the start of out relationship, I do keep the light off during sex almost exclusively and almost always close my eyes, and we've showered together once and that was in bare candlelight. I still cover myself up rather than not, we just have sex almost everyday, so he sees me naked a lot. He sees me naked more than I see myself. I just.. trust that he isn't my ED.

I still cover myself up rather than not, we just have sex almost everyday, so he sees me naked a lot. He sees me naked more than I see myself. I just.. trust that he isn't my ED.

It's not so much loving your body but believing your SO that he adores yours, even if you can't see it.\n\nI struggled a lot with him seeing me naked at the start of out relationship, I do keep the light off during sex almost exclusively and almost always close my eyes, and we've showered together once and that was in bare candlelight. I still cover myself up rather than not, we just have sex almost everyday, so he sees me naked a lot. He sees me naked more than I see myself. I just.. trust that he isn't my ED.

It's not so much loving your body but believing your SO that he adores yours, even if you can't see it.\n\nI struggled a lot with him seeing me naked at the start of out relationship, I do keep the light off during sex almost exclusively and almost always close my eyes, and we've showered together once and that was in bare candlelight. I still cover myself up rather than not, we just have sex almost everyday, so he sees me naked a lot. He sees me naked more than I see myself. I just.. trust that he isn't my ED. You'll find someone who gets you there too. \u2764\n\n",

I still cover myself up rather than not, we just have sex almost everyday, so he sees me naked a lot. He sees me naked more than I see myself. I just.. trust that he isn't my ED.

It's not so much loving your body but believing your SO that he adores yours, even if you can't see it.\n\nI struggled a lot with him seeing me naked at the start of out relationship, I do keep the light off during sex almost exclusively and almost always close my eyes, and we've showered together once and that was in bare candlelight. I still cover myself up rather than not, we just have sex almost everyday, so he sees me naked a lot. He sees me naked more than I see myself. I just.. trust that he isn't my ED. You'll find someone who gets you there too. \u2764\n\n",

My thighs are so skinny like I have pretty good calves muscle so my skinny pants are tight there but loose on my thighs. I know it\u2019s dysmorphia but I feel it looks unbalanced. I lift weights and I\u2019m trying to gain stronger thighs and hamstrings but so hard for me to gain muscle there but I can gain it in my ass or arms or whatever more easily \n\nI went from 34D to 32DD which is pretty much the same thing but I think that\u2019s too small on me too tbh",
