Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about.

I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

Given my frame I think my BMR should be 1200-1300ish but somehow my daily movements (which isnt a lot) must add up to just about my consumption, on average. I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too. Even though I feel like I\u2019m eating a lot more than before everyday, on the aggregate restriction+occasional binges might add up to be the same calories anyway.",

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

Given my frame I think my BMR should be 1200-1300ish but somehow my daily movements (which isnt a lot) must add up to just about my consumption, on average. I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too. Even though I feel like I\u2019m eating a lot more than before everyday, on the aggregate restriction+occasional binges might add up to be the same calories anyway.",

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about.

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about.

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

I will always have the option to go get my (D)NP which, in 2019, is so similar to physicians in practice, its almost laughable anyone follows the traditional medical school route anymore. Nursing offered me more growth, options, and the medical theory matched my personal beliefs about approach to care much more.",

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about.

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

I mean you will still lose weight eating 1500 calories while my fat ass would definately gain on that amount *sigh*\nAs much as I hate my body right now, I feel like I really have no choice but  to accept it because I know if I go lower than 1200 as of the moment I would just binge my progress back and I know bingeing would just activate my anxiety and make me even more mentally fucked than I already am if I do get fat from it.\nIt sucks but 1200 calories is the lowest recommended for women for a reason because it really is impossible to go lower than that and meet your body's nutrients, and bingeing on high calorie foods is just your body's way of telling you to load up on nutrients. I reckon it's so much easier to meet your macro and micro nutrient requirements eating a substantial amount when you're already tall and have so much calories left to spare",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

I observed the nursing whole body approach and it resonated with me much more than how we were being taught to enter the medical field as a doctor.\n\nAlso, I wanted to start my career sooner. I will always have the option to go get my (D)NP which, in 2019, is so similar to physicians in practice, its almost laughable anyone follows the traditional medical school route anymore. Nursing offered me more growth, options, and the medical theory matched my personal beliefs about approach to care much more.",

                        "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

I am in grad school so I usually take my books to the gym to make time in for class as well.  Also hot yoga or hot Pilates was such a good calorie burner when I was into it, but it got expensive and alas I have no time for it anymore.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about.

Given my frame I think my BMR should be 1200-1300ish but somehow my daily movements (which isnt a lot) must add up to just about my consumption, on average. I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too. Even though I feel like I\u2019m eating a lot more than before everyday, on the aggregate restriction+occasional binges might add up to be the same calories anyway.",

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

                        "Text": "My guess is that my TDEE is actually a lot higher than what I\u2019ve been told. Given my frame I think my BMR should be 1200-1300ish but somehow my daily movements (which isnt a lot) must add up to just about my consumption, on average. I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too. Even though I feel like I\u2019m eating a lot more than before everyday, on the aggregate restriction+occasional binges might add up to be the same calories anyway.",

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

I observed the nursing whole body approach and it resonated with me much more than how we were being taught to enter the medical field as a doctor.\n\nAlso, I wanted to start my career sooner. I will always have the option to go get my (D)NP which, in 2019, is so similar to physicians in practice, its almost laughable anyone follows the traditional medical school route anymore. Nursing offered me more growth, options, and the medical theory matched my personal beliefs about approach to care much more.",

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I\u2019d believe that. I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too. Even though I feel like I\u2019m eating a lot more than before everyday, on the aggregate restriction+occasional binges might add up to be the same calories anyway.",

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

                        "Text": "The fastest path: do pre-recs (what you need depends on the school and your county/ state. Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about. I'm always down to chat.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE.

                            "Text": "Not sure why you've gotten downvoted either, on my screen you still have 1 point.\n\nMore science knowledge is a good thing! \n\nThat's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",

I\u2019m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don\u2019t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

Some accept high school grads depending on references or volunteering from what I've heard, Most require HESI or ATI testing to get accepted which needs studying for), get accepted to a nursing school. 2 years of classes and clinicals, graduate, write your NCLEX for your liscense and pass. Begin working. This will give you your RN and an associate degree. I reccomend this bc you can always go for further education and many hospitals offer reimbursement and even sponsorship programs to get higher degrees. My friend recently scored a MSN program through her work and she attends night classes and will get her masters in 4 years fully paid off. I wish I just got my associates out of high school tbh. (I might be slightly off with this as I did not follow a traditional route for my degree so please do your own research as well :> )\n\nPath I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest. This gave me my bachelors in nursing, a minor in healthcare ethics, and worsened my depression. \n\nDespite the torture, I do believe this is my path in life and I really cherish the honor of caring for others at their most vulnerable moments. \n\nPlease let me know if I didnt answer something you were curious about.

A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself \"constantly active\". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not \"very hypothetically speaking\" at all. \n\nYour last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people. \n\nMy original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",
