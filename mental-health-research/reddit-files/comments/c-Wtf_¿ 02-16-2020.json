So I try to avoid gluten, but will eat a little bread each morning. \n\nI've found the Jarrow EPS probiotics (made for IBS, specifically) to help! But after being on them a few years, I've noticed that my symptoms are rather getting worse, or that they are decreasing in efficacy. I went to a GI doctor about it, but she doesn't seem to know anything about POTS, and seems to think that I just need more fiber, and to avoid sorbitol (which I'm getting ready to do....).\n\nit's hard, when medicine doesn't have answers, I'm sorry you are in the same boat!",

I only recently have had bouts of diarrhea, but I think they are reactionary (from my colon trying so hard to redirect the water, and over-shooting lol).\n\nStomach problems are super common with POTS - and they are almost always first diagnosed as IBS, or symptoms that fall under the IBS umbrella! Not getting consistent and healthy, reliable blood supply to your stomach does some wonky things when it comes to your digestion.\n\nHave you found anything helpful for our IBS? I just got a sorbitol/breath testing done, and my digestion was basically non existent, according to a 3 hour long test. :( I use probiotics but they don't help much anymore.",

Going gluten free helps too, but with my Ed history, doctors tell me I'm full of shit (which I quite often am, lol) when I tell them that being gluten free and dairy free helps. So I try to avoid gluten, but will eat a little bread each morning. \n\nI've found the Jarrow EPS probiotics (made for IBS, specifically) to help! But after being on them a few years, I've noticed that my symptoms are rather getting worse, or that they are decreasing in efficacy. I went to a GI doctor about it, but she doesn't seem to know anything about POTS, and seems to think that I just need more fiber, and to avoid sorbitol (which I'm getting ready to do....).\n\nit's hard, when medicine doesn't have answers, I'm sorry you are in the same boat!",
