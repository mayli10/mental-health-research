Eating two. tubs of them is equivalent to eating 3 Oreos, so you can imagine my happiness with the fact I'd feel full faster and under fewer cal. My SO pointed out after I ate ine tub that it said in tiny text \"May cause laxative effect if eaten in high quantities.\"\n\nI am usually constipated so i was like \"Hey, a win win!\"\n\nI was wrong. I learned my lesson. I'm never binge eating those things again. I'm still in pain after the fact :(",
