Getting dressed in the morning and having my clothes all look good on me every day means I can confidently wear whatever I want whenever I want. Getting dressed tends to be one of the first things anyone does in the morning and not feeling confident in something you want to wear can set you into a negative mood for the rest of the day. It's not exactly that wearing something different is such a big deal, it's that if you're in a negative mood you're more likely to keep reacting negatively towards things that happen. Like if you go out to lunch and they get your order slightly wrong you'll probably be okay with that if you had a good morning, but if you had a poor morning you'll probably just feel worse. Losing weight absolutely can make people happier overall. I think the real issue is trying to find the right weight for you. Being too thin comes with it's own problems, but different people at different weights will be happier even if they have to deal with those problems while others will only be happy if they don't have to deal with them. It's a bit more complicated than just saying losing weight makes people happier, but it's also not inaccurate to say that.",
