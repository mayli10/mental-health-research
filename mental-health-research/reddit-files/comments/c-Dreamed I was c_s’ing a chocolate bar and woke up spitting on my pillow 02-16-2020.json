The night before my appointment I had a nightmare where I accepted their offer and they sat it on the floor. After which I crawled on my hands and knees about to lap out of it like a dog. Then I felt this torment knowing that if I drank it I would fail and never reach my goal weight. So I just stared at the cup on the floor struggling, and then woke up. It was a new low for me, haha.",
