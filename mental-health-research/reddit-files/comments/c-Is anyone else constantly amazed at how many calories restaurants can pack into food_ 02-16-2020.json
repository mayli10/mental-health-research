It can be expensive to do it that way, but since I had no experience to start with, I really valued the risk management and the availability of gear that you just don't get from trying to go outside on your own. \n\nIf you're in the US and looking to climb outside, check out \"Mountain Project\" it's a website run by REI. it's a catalog of great places to climb with reviews and info.

It can be expensive to do it that way, but since I had no experience to start with, I really valued the risk management and the availability of gear that you just don't get from trying to go outside on your own. \n\nIf you're in the US and looking to climb outside, check out \"Mountain Project\" it's a website run by REI. it's a catalog of great places to climb with reviews and info. They also include climbing gyms too!",

It can be expensive to do it that way, but since I had no experience to start with, I really valued the risk management and the availability of gear that you just don't get from trying to go outside on your own. \n\nIf you're in the US and looking to climb outside, check out \"Mountain Project\" it's a website run by REI. it's a catalog of great places to climb with reviews and info. They also include climbing gyms too!",

                    "Text": "Nah you\u2019re safe, I cook professionally so I get how restaurants works. They don\u2019t go with the butter/fat/salt because it tastes good, but one \u201clittle\u201d spoonful of butter is 100 calories, and you can easily use a few of those to saut\u00e9 something. Portion sizes are also super off. It\u2019s not a problem to use fat and salt for food, but the portions need to be smaller because you\u2019ll fill up on it faster. People complain about french portions being \u201ctiny,\u201d but that\u2019s because the food is rich, so that\u2019s how it should be. \n\nRestaurant appetizers are typically more like proper meal portions. \n\nAnyway, point being you\u2019re ok with whatever you\u2019re making at home :)\n\nEDIT: I figured I\u2019d share a tip I learned from my \u201cnaturally skinny\u201d cousin (she\u2019s healthy thin and definitely doesn\u2019t have an ED) who\u2019s 5\u20191\u2013most of the time when she goes to restaurants, she\u2019ll just order an appetizer and maybe a side salad with dressing on the side and ask for it to come out with the main dishes. The salad ends up making it look like a normal amount of food (which I notice, she just orders it since some appetizers don\u2019t have vegetables in them), and then she can actually eat all/most of her dish. The times I\u2019ve seen her order normal plates, she only ends up eating like 1/4-1/5 of it because she fills up so quickly. So I realized how insane normal restaurant portions are from her",

And then on date night I usually can convince him to let me cook before or after so we don\u2019t have to spend money since we have things we are trying to save up for (like a wedding).\n\nWe used to eat out like once or twice a week before we were trying to save money and it was so hard. Especially since we always wanted to try local places that don\u2019t have calorie counts",

It can be expensive to do it that way, but since I had no experience to start with, I really valued the risk management and the availability of gear that you just don't get from trying to go outside on your own. \n\nIf you're in the US and looking to climb outside, check out \"Mountain Project\" it's a website run by REI. it's a catalog of great places to climb with reviews and info.

It can be expensive to do it that way, but since I had no experience to start with, I really valued the risk management and the availability of gear that you just don't get from trying to go outside on your own. \n\nIf you're in the US and looking to climb outside, check out \"Mountain Project\" it's a website run by REI. it's a catalog of great places to climb with reviews and info. They also include climbing gyms too!",
