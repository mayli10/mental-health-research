Try harder next time and don\u2019t zero in on someone who actually knows what\u2019s going on if you want to be listened to with any modicum of expertise. You have a literally achieve nothing except to crap on someone else in this discourse. I hope you\u2019re happy with yourself.

I know he\u2019s excited about it and it distresses him immensely when I can\u2019t eat or I get sick on what I do try to eat. I know that he is proud of me when I manage to be \u201cnormal \u201cfor 30 minutes of a day but it does actually feel like maybe I\u2019ve done too much. It\u2019s really strange, on one hand I feel proud of myself, but I also recognize that none of it is in my control and beyond that the stress that I experience is a pivotal factor in whether or not I throw up. It just feels awful to see the faces of people who care about you when you ask for a bag to throw up in because they mention food or you even smell food and your body simply can\u2019t tolerate it. \n\nI would rather deal with that disappointment than an NG tube though.

So this happened a while ago but I was talking to this dude who was raving about this girl he met on a dating app saying things like \u201cshe\u2019s so cool\u201d etc etc but as soon as he met her irl, he realized she was \u201cfat.\u201d And used \u201cfalse\u201d pictures (his words). He texted me around midnight right after his date ended to whine about her weight!!! The irony is he\u2019s chunky himself! He\u2019s still quite on the OW side (he was obese before, on an active weight loss journey) but one would think as a a current/former fattie, he\u2019d have more compassion but he was just a shallow asshole. GOOD RIDDANCE for that girl. She dodged a bullet. I just hope he was nice to her tho and didn\u2019t let his disappointment show because she took time out of her life to meet up with him, even if it didn\u2019t work out.",

We are talking about a weight loss of over 200 pounds - there is skin and stubborn fatty areas both above and below muscle that don\u2019t decrease without intervention with plastic surgery. If my additional excess skin were to be removed, I\u2019d be underweight - and they removed 15+ with liposuction and skin removal from my pannus in the past month.\n\nPlus - a wider frame necessitates more weight by default of actual size. My hips are wide set, my body won\u2019t willingly recede in weight to expose them as bone because \u201cthat\u2019s not how weight loss works.\u201d",

I know he\u2019s excited about it and it distresses him immensely when I can\u2019t eat or I get sick on what I do try to eat. I know that he is proud of me when I manage to be \u201cnormal \u201cfor 30 minutes of a day but it does actually feel like maybe I\u2019ve done too much. It\u2019s really strange, on one hand I feel proud of myself, but I also recognize that none of it is in my control and beyond that the stress that I experience is a pivotal factor in whether or not I throw up. It just feels awful to see the faces of people who care about you when you ask for a bag to throw up in because they mention food or you even smell food and your body simply can\u2019t tolerate it. \n\nI would rather deal with that disappointment than an NG tube though.

I know he\u2019s excited about it and it distresses him immensely when I can\u2019t eat or I get sick on what I do try to eat. I know that he is proud of me when I manage to be \u201cnormal \u201cfor 30 minutes of a day but it does actually feel like maybe I\u2019ve done too much. It\u2019s really strange, on one hand I feel proud of myself, but I also recognize that none of it is in my control and beyond that the stress that I experience is a pivotal factor in whether or not I throw up. It just feels awful to see the faces of people who care about you when you ask for a bag to throw up in because they mention food or you even smell food and your body simply can\u2019t tolerate it. \n\nI would rather deal with that disappointment than an NG tube though.
