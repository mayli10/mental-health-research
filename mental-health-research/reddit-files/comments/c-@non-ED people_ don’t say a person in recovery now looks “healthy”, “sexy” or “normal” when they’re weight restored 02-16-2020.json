In a lot of cases it's more like \"my problem is that I weigh too much for me to be happy but too little for me to be healthy\". So telling me I look healthier doesn't seem to be a compliment to me.\n\nI guess healthy people don't want to \"look underweight\" so they would be happier if they heard it so I can understand where it's coming from. But it doesn't help that it's a compliment to them since all that means is that they feel positively towards me, but the approval from others isn't my end goal in life and doesn't fix my body image issues. ughh",

                "Text": "YES. I can excuse it when it' s just friends and family even when it hurts. But I can't believe how many doctors, therapists and nutritionists - people who have frigging STUDIED eating disorders - feel entitled to make comments on my appearance. That kind of incompetence, borderline malpractice, enrages me.\n\nI've had a lot of doctors tell me things like I would be more \"womanly\" if I gained weight and \"men like curves\" (ewwww - why do they even assume my partner is male???). And my (now fired) therapist and my (soon-to-be fired) nutritionist even made comments about how I would get bigger boobs if I were gained weight. 1) Why is that something they assume I would want? 2) Some women don't gain much weight in their breasts - I don't. 3) Why are we replacing a tyranny of size with a tyranny of shape? Why is the goal to become more (hetero)fuckable in a supernormative 1950s model of what's sexy? Why does my nutritionist mention Marilyn friggin' Monroe every time I see her? Why the fuck does any of this matter?\n\nMy nutritionist even told me I had a little bit of a belly (I'm only an 18 BMI now, coming up from a 13 BMI!). I had to school her on how you bloat during refeeding and recovering anorexics often initially gain weight around vital organs before redistribution. She should know that shit and learn how to talk about it in a tactful way. Rationally I know what's going on but it was still triggering AF.",

We've been together for a decade and he has seen me lose and gain the same 30 lbs. I have told him so many times that I don't like for my body to be complimented as it doesn't make me feel good, but he forgets sometimes. It is a weird thing to be upset about to non-ED peeps. I'm trying to make my peace with it.\n\nAlthough, in fairness, he catches himself about half of the time and when he does, he'll say something like, \"You look like a corpse, pabstpumpkinbeer\" because I once showed him a meme from r/EDanonymemes that said something like \"Tell me I look like a corpse or get out\" and I couldn't stop laughing at it.",
