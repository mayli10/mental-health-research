I lived in Florida for a few years but it was at least 10 years ago, so it took me a second to remember if this was real bc it still seems fucking insane. Wtf Publix/Florida??\n\nI know grocery chains aren\u2019t universal so for anyone who\u2019s confused about what I\u2019m talking about, I\u2019ll explain: Publix (the major grocery chain giant in Florida, and other parts of the south) has scales at the entrance. They look like giant versions of the fruit/veggie scales in the produce department. But they are for people, so you can weigh yourself when you walk in. PEOPLE ACTUALLY WIEGH THEMSELVES, IN PUBLIC (also in Publix...), AT THE FUCKING GROCERY STORE. Jesus Christ, that still blows my mind. Never in a million years would I step on that scale (tho part of my was dying to every time I walked in).\n\n\nYikes. Still, I can\u2019t imagine who the fuck came up with that or why the fuck people actually use them -  all the time.",
