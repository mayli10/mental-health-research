We never once talked about our EDs together, though we did talk sometimes, but I used to see her drinking cup after cup of tea in the dining hall, getting skinnier and skinnier, and I always wondered if she saw me doing the same. I actually feel this weird sense of connection to her still, like we\u2019re Sad Quiet Eating Disorder Friends. I don\u2019t really know how she\u2019s doing, but I think things got Better for her at least for a while. Her hair looks a lot shinier now! I hope she\u2019s doing ok.",

She wanted to tell me that I was not too much, not too little, but just enough and perfect the way I was. (I admit that I teared up then). Then, she never brought it up again, and we didn\u2019t discuss it further.  \n  \nI have no clue how she knew, maybe she just had really good instincts or it was a lucky guess.

I was in their frozen foods aisle, trying to pick something and like the food, I was frozen. I was figeting with my fingers but was standing in the same spot for a while, thoughts racing, terrified about what I could eat without it turning into a binge.\n\nI didn't snap out of it until a nice woman who didn't look much older than me walked up, gently reached out in front of me, and picked up a bag of the shrimp stir-fry. I remember her smiling and saying in a quiet voice, \"this is my go-to.\" I tried to smile back but I don't think I managed that too well because then she whispered, \"it's gonna be okay,\" before she left with her cart and although it was weird and I was kinda shook, it was nice to hear. \n\nI never saw her again but I think about her sometimes, I still wonder about her.",

Then one day she completely opened up to me and then I suddenly told her everything without realizing and started crying because I\u2019d never ever done that in the 4 years I\u2019d been dealing with it.  I kind of pushed her away after that because I was terrified someone knew but eventually I realized she probably needed the support just as much as I did, and now she\u2019s one of my best friends.
