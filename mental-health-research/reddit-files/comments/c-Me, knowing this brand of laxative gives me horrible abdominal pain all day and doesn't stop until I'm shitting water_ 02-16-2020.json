My husband has IBS and his doctor suggested he take 2tbsp at a time rather than the 2tsp serving size, so I thought 2tbsp was the serving size when I started taking it too... It makes a THICK shake like that and I like throwing in chia/hemp/flax seeds for good measure\n\nThank you for the concern and the reminder \u2764 Also I forgot prunes are high fiber and fuckn lov prunes",
