Because I want to give you a big cuddle, take you to a nice secluded place with lots of old cups and plates and let you yell your lungs out, then break every single one of those things and just cry for a moment.\n\nBut reality - darling, stop. Please. EDs are a mechanism of self-perpetuating self-punishment . They thrive on precisely this type of interpersonal problem. This is another method of torture and it's just perpetuating the same self hating cycle, now with added personal sexual identity. If I may extrapolate, EDs dehumanize you to nought but flesh and numbers, and now it's using your very own sexuality and being against you to feed off of. I'm very, very sorry that you are in this situation. Please know I understand. I'm a gay person unable to stand touch, but longing for companionship and love is never not gut punching me. I've been in this situation. And it was at best an excuse to hurt myself further, at worst, well, it ended very badly for me. Please just let her go. You deserve someone who will give you what I can hear you would give, just from reading your words. And when that person comes, they'll be so very lucky to have you. Don't waste fine wine to water crops that will wither and leave your garden sad, empty, and toxic to your being. You deserve to flourish.",

I met her at a pride picnic last year, got her number and we started talking daily for a bit. But...she was a therapist at an eating disorder facility (what are the odds??)  and now feels that she can\u2019t be attracted to skinny girls bc they remind her too much of patients at work.  She tried with me but in the end couldn\u2019t get into me sexually. First time in my life I\u2019ve been rejected for being too thin instead of fat.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nSide note: maybe this girl has different taste in women than she does with men?  I tend to be attracted to thicc women but thinner men so you never know. \n\nSorry if this comment is really unhelpful or weird. ED brain has won for today. Lol \ud83d\ude06",

I always end up with girls with flat stomachs and nicer butts and it's very hot, and what I am attracted to, but it also makes me aware that my body is not as nice as the women I fuck.

The girl I am hooking up with right now has such a nice body and it makes me feel bummed about mine, but like also she is really hot and I'm into it.",

Believe me, you are already loveable and falling for a straight girl is (something i am personally v guilty of ngl) definetely gonna break ur heart and probably even worsen your ed.
