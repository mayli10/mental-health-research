                "Text": "In the Uber home from my last shift this weekend.  It was fucking brutal.  I\u2019m a waitress for parties at a popular children\u2019s arcade and pizza restaurant in a particularly not a great neighborhood, and this weekend has fucking drained me.  So many people Calling/yelling across the restaurant at me, keeping things going smooth, lost my keys and had a panic attack and everyone refused to help me look, even my best friend/roommate.  It\u2019s a stressful job and anytime I get stressed now I get like instant cold sweats and shakes so I was literally standing there shaking and sweating asking for help and my roommate just looked at me and was like welp sorry can\u2019t help gotta stand here and do nothing.  Couple all that with constantly being surrounded by food\n\nIt\u2019s been a really long weekend and stressful and exhausting and I had to work several more hours than anticipated today so I\u2019m exhausted, thanks for letting me rant on your post \ud83d\udc95",

I had the worst ever servers to work with. I regularly worked 11/12 hour shifts and thanks to the state I lived in, I wasn't actually legally allowed to take breaks if my boss didn't allow it. I could be denied breaks and it was legal. I didn't have a car so I had to walk an hour there and an hour back because I couldn't use up money on uber. \n\nSo I was on my feet constantly about to pass out, people getting pissed at me because they had to wait to be seated when the place was completely full, servers not properly cleaning up after themselves so I ended up needing to bus their tables for them, then cue the complaining from them when I DIDN'T do THEIR job because they weren't getting tables, I averaged over 25k steps a day because of that shit. I regularly would go to the bathroom to stress cry and body check because I was a living nightmare. \n\nI would regularly hide behind the dumpster on one of my self imposed breaks that I would force myself to be able to have.  Me and the other host, a wonderful dude who I would talk about Sonic the Hedgehog and superheroes with, had an agreement that we would cover for each other if we needed a rest. I'd honestly use those to smoke a bowl and numb myself out before going back into nightmare land where people would snap to get my attention for ketchup.",

                "Text": "Dude, yes. I work with food and hate it. I've been stuck in a cycle of outpatient recovery and quitting it and restricting until I break down and go back to the eating disorder specialist. Work makes it worse I think. People look down on food service jobs, but honestly it is a lot of time spent on your feet and a lot is expected from you. A few months ago I was in a downward spiral and at one point didn't eat anything at all for 3 days. In those 3 days I had to work hours bent over hot grills, supervise others, etc while trying to not faint and pretending to be fine. But it also goes the other way; when I'm trying to follow the meal plans, or when my appetite comes back, everything looks disgusting and not worth eating. It often feels like I just can't win. I am starting outpatient again in a few days and hopefully finally figure it out and get better. It is comforting yet sad to read how other people can relate to this.\n\nEdit: fixed a typo",
