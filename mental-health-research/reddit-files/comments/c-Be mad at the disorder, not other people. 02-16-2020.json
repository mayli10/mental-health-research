The cashiers at Whole Foods always do it like that. Must be part of their training lol. \n\n\nThe sleepover comment is just weird. How often do people have sleepovers? Odds are, you were getting that food for literally any other reason than a sleepover. You never know what people are going through, so it\u2019s better not to make assumptions. That food could have been to cheer up a sick child at the hospital, or like... food for a funeral or something. Or just a lonely person stocking their pantry with their favorite treats, who now feels even lonelier. \n\n\nI still remember the motherfucker from the bagel shop, who said \u201cWow!!! You must be hungry!!\u201d when I ordered two sandwiches *to go*. I was bringing them home for me and my boyfriend for lunch... which is a normal fucking thing to do. Even if I were getting them for myself, why would you shame a customer for giving you more sales?? Disorder aside, I just think that\u2019s objectively rude. Mind your own business.

Just to sit with the crew and enjoy a social chat.\n\nI completely blanked and didn't even remember until I got back home that I had left the lunch out on my counter in the morning.\n\nIdk, it gets hard when people keep offering and it also gets extremely hard when they stop because they're afraid of bringing up the topic.\n\nI've thrown away food in a great local restaurant in front of the owner and my friends and my boss because the salad was touching a piece of bread. It hurt me so much to do so because I wanted to eat it. I was genuinely hungry.\n\nIdk, sometimes these compulsions can drive me more than I expect? Never thought I'd be at such a difficult place",

That doesn\u2019t mean we need to be perfect, or that we\u2019re going to be able to step back and think rationally about a situation or behave healthily. It\u2019s just something I think we need to be aware of. It\u2019s not fair to project our issues on to other people. All you can do is your best on any given day.

I\u2019m the same way and I think the same and I know I am internally cursing people and I have a hard time being empathic and understanding why they give me extra food. Then the next day I would work at my job at a pizza place and if someone ended up waiting longer than 20 minutes for their order I would give them extra food for free thinking I was making them happy and I somehow failed to realize my hypocrisy but our society as a whole uses food as such a barrier breaker I guess you could say. It\u2019s a way of saying sorry, thank you, get better soon, I love you, ect. And it can be difficult but understanding that can make life much easier when we want to curse someone to hell for giving us extra food that we can\u2019t resist eating because they truly believe they are doing us a favor.
