I have a wide ribcage, small bust, and really fat arms and I carry weight in my neck. I also have a really wide waist.  I'm not thicc or curvy. I feel disfigured. \n\nThe whole compliment from someone who has never seen me saying they'd probably be attracted to me was just a blatant lie to try to make me feel better.

But let's face it I'm one of the older people here with no relationship experience because men are repulsed by everything about me. Sorry, I really didnt mean to trigger anyone but I've spent all day crying in bed trying to plan my suicide with a small break for therapy where my therapist gave me two referrals to psychiatrists who arent taking new patients. I'm a lost cause and I'm so overwhelmed with disgust for myself.",

Like I always gave so much love so really why keep the relationship open?  Oh right so when someone better comes along its adios amigos we found us a new and improved Taco. \n\nIf I was the best Taco this problem would be resolved. But clearly I'm like sloppy guac on nachos, they'll indulge but it's messy and there's no effort to keep things in order. Waiting for the day I transform from nacho cheese to Taco fiesta.  I'm not even Mexican...  I don't know why this analogy developed, but i feel it described the situation. You take care with your tacos. Nachos aren't even in order to begin with.",

It would have to be an occasion where I'm just feeling really fat, like post-Thanksgiving or PMS bloated type of fat to turn me off entirely, I guess. But I personally found that having sex with someone for the first time with them while your shirt is on helps you to getting comfortable enough to where you can do it fully unclothed the next time or the time after that if that doesn't work. If that makes any sense. But that also may stem from gender bias since I'm a female and people usually still find it sexy when a girl wears her partner's shirt or something. The double standard from society would make something like that more difficult for the males who aren't comfortable having sex nude, I would presume.",

If I've had enough to drink it doesn't bother me as much but I remember one morning my bf walked in on me showering and just hopped right in with me and I was mortified, like \"omg don't look at me!!\" And oh God I was so embarrassed with my reaction. He convinced me to stay in with him by telling me he loved the way I look and he loves me and then we smashed and I'm glad it happened but still cringey how I reacted.",

I even went years without dating and still didnt acheive the perfect body in that time and i just reached a point where im ready to be with someone.
