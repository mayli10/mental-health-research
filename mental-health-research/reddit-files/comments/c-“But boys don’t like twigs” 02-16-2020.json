I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day. It\u2019s still hard sometimes, but fuck it\u2019s light years brighter than what it used to be as far as my headspace/wellbeing.",

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day. It\u2019s still hard sometimes, but fuck it\u2019s light years brighter than what it used to be as far as my headspace/wellbeing.",

I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day. It\u2019s still hard sometimes, but fuck it\u2019s light years brighter than what it used to be as far as my headspace/wellbeing.",

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day. It\u2019s still hard sometimes, but fuck it\u2019s light years brighter than what it used to be as far as my headspace/wellbeing.",

I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.

You\u2019re definitely enough, love, it\u2019s amazing how enough you are. \n\nYou say you\u2019ve been doing this since 7th grade, right? Well, you suffered for years and years on end and yet you\u2019re still alive. Even if you feel absolutely horrible, I\u2019m honestly so incredibly proud of you for being alive, staying strong, being brave as fuck and getting through things. I see you and I respect you for it. \nYou\u2019re more loved than you know, you really are, but when you don\u2019t love yourself it\u2019s pretty difficult to believe somebody loves you, even when they absolutely do. You\u2019re not alone in this, I promise you \ud83d\udc93",

If you\u2019re seriously thinking about doing something like that please talk to someone. I asked for help a couple years ago when I was strung out on meth/heroin and homeless for a fair bit. I know about that dark place very well and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone and I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through it. Now I\u2019m 2 years clean tho and found a way to live without wanting to die every day.
