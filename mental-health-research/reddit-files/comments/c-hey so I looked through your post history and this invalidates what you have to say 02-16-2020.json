Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support.

                        "Text": "I have both. Sadly this IS how people treat cancer. God forbid you say anything negative about cancer or show anything other than complete positivity. Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

                        "Text": "Lol this originally caused a lotttt of argument which is why people started heading into my post history but more specifically I think the OP was like 28 living with mom and dad, no career and no education. They asked for advice and were basically like \u201cis this weird?\u201d \nAnd I thought yeah it\u2019s weird / uncommon / not typical and there\u2019s really no reason unless you or a parent is mentally ill / disabled / sick etc. \nI figured no job, no home, no life of your own with no excuse makes one look like a loser. Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

They asked for advice and were basically like \u201cis this weird?\u201d \nAnd I thought yeah it\u2019s weird / uncommon / not typical and there\u2019s really no reason unless you or a parent is mentally ill / disabled / sick etc. \nI figured no job, no home, no life of your own with no excuse makes one look like a loser. Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat.

I get it's a public profile on the internet, but maybe I am just less of a creep and don't go out of my way to go through all the comments of the people who I come across. I don't use an alt, so sometimes I get weird messages from people where I have replied to their comment, but it's about something totally different from my post history in a different sub which weirds me out.\n\n My bf showed me a screenshot of something from reddit the other day and I was like 'oh is that you' and he seemed hesitant, and I realised it was probably cause he realised I could go look through all his comments and stuff but that thought didn't even cross my mind - I get that this stuff is public, but I am super private and wouldn't really want other people I know looking at all my stuff so I don't do it to them.

                        "Text": "I have both. Sadly this IS how people treat cancer. God forbid you say anything negative about cancer or show anything other than complete positivity. Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

                        "Text": "Lol this originally caused a lotttt of argument which is why people started heading into my post history but more specifically I think the OP was like 28 living with mom and dad, no career and no education. They asked for advice and were basically like \u201cis this weird?\u201d \nAnd I thought yeah it\u2019s weird / uncommon / not typical and there\u2019s really no reason unless you or a parent is mentally ill / disabled / sick etc. \nI figured no job, no home, no life of your own with no excuse makes one look like a loser. Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat.

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat.

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

                        "Text": "I have both. Sadly this IS how people treat cancer. God forbid you say anything negative about cancer or show anything other than complete positivity. Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

                        "Text": "I have both. Sadly this IS how people treat cancer. God forbid you say anything negative about cancer or show anything other than complete positivity. Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

                        "Text": "I have both. Sadly this IS how people treat cancer. God forbid you say anything negative about cancer or show anything other than complete positivity. Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat.

Whether it\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s the perception. Cause like at what age is someone just taking advantage of mom and dad and refusing to grow up? 28? 35? 40? \n\nBut that\u2019s just my personal opinion and Reddit is a great place to get crucified for having an opinion that differs from the norm. PS in the ED community I know a lot of people live at home but I consider that to be circumstances of illness / mental illness or whatever that often requires that level of care / family support. In that case it makes total sense. But moving out at 21 instead of 31 didn\u2019t cause my mental illness and the fact that people upvoted that made me feel nauseous af. ",

Or God forbid you gain weight during treatment. \n\nSociety loves positive and happy cancer survivors to teach everyone about the power of positivity. And society loves cancer patients who become sick and immaciated because it justifies the inhumanity of treatment in ways that gaining weight just doesn't. \n\nIf you are a cancer patient who is angry, gtfo. Mind over matter. You gotta be positive. And if you are a cancer patient who gained weight, gtfo.  You're doing it wrong. Why are you eating? Oh it's so good you have an appetite! Oh it's so good you aren't skinny! As you, the patient, slowly die inside as you watch your body act and react in ways you don't understand. \n\nI had BDD for years but never turned to ED until I finished cancer treatment. I believe that the proportion of cancer survivors with new onset BDD and ED is far more than oncologists are willing to admit. And until the medical community admits this, they will continue to fail their oncology patients and contribute to a cycle of unhealthy behaviors and emotional instability. \n\nEvery oncology appointment goes the same way. \"You're underweight. You need to gain weight. Drink some shakes.\" without a single thought given to the physiological and psychological reasons why I am underweight or won't eat. Every oncology nutrition problem is treated by throwing shakes at it \ud83d\ude21",
