                "Text": "Hey, I am sort of accidentally spamming people with this but it's really helpful to me and I want to help anyone that's trying to beat ED's. I posted this yesterday:\n\n\n\"So my therapist isn't accepting that I have an ED and is working with me on my PTSD and OCD instead but they have given me a really useful resource. \n\nhttps://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/For-Clinicians/Eating-Disorders\n\nI'm almost done with the \"Workbook: overcoming disordered eating: Part 1\" and even though it's like reading a school textbook it is actually helpful. My aim is to complete it, along with the suggested food diary and charts then take it to a therapist that specialises in ED's. I'll have actual evidence in diary form that way and my own thoughts on each aspect of my ED. \n\nTake a look. I answer the questions in a notebook instead of on the sheets because then I can read them on my phone or computer and answer on paper. I have them all printed out too but I find the sheets too big and awkward to write on and not enough space. \n\nI hope this helps at least one of you. \"",
