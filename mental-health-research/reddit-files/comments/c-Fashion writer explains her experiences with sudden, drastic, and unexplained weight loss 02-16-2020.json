                "Text": "I've always wondered why it is that so many men get hot and bothered over super-skinny women. You'd think attraction is somewhat dependent on biology, yknow? That the women who'd make the best babies would be the most tempting, even if you're just looking for a one night stand. But I've definitely noticed that I receive even more advances at 80-85lbs(bmi 15.1-16.1) than at 90-95lbs(bmi 17-18). It's not just being slim- it's being skinny or even sickly. \n\nI think maybe it's rebellious in some way and that's the appeal? That there is absolutely no physical reason to be into that so it's fun for them to be with someone that skinny in the same way it's fun for me to be that skinny? Or simple shock and awe? Or the novelty of it? People often become obsessed with oddities. I don't really know but I'd sure as hell like to.",

                "Text": "Ugh. This is my former self... and my not so far away, yet SO VERY FAR away, current self. I spent many years at 5'6\" and 100-ish lbs, I'd say 103 on average. I freaking loved being that weight. For me, there's such a big difference in being above 105 and it's about the feel and the look, not the number. It's just so different, especially in how my legs look. Right now I'm stuck at 107/108 and can't cross that line. And I'm talking stuck for a couple years now. I gained weight when I quit birth control and was 111 when I got pregnant. Then I gained 44 lbs while pregnant, immediately dropped 30 the first week, and the rest was mine to lose the hard way. I am having SUCH a hard time getting to 105 (although breaking 110 was no walk in the park and made a huge difference in my satisfaction with myself, so maybe I should focus on being happy about that). \n\nSuffice to say, Lord am I triggered. Just when I thought I might be fine with this weight, especially since it's technically less than when I got pregnant... Not so sure about that now",
