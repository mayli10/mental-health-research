I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening.

[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943438/) focusses on athletes and I think it might apply to EDs too bc athletes undergo the type of extreme weight loss attempts our ED brain comes up with (extreme being the keyword, this ain't \"starvation mode\" from a reasonable caloric deficit over a longer period of time) for e.g. bodybuilding competitions.\n\n[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4989512/) is about \"Persistent metabolic adaptation 6 years after The Biggest Loser competition\" and also an interesting read :)\n\n(for the record, I'm no scientist and doped up on dayquil, so take all of this with a grain of salt or do follow-up research)",

Some days were less than and some days were over 1200. I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943438/) focusses on athletes and I think it might apply to EDs too bc athletes undergo the type of extreme weight loss attempts our ED brain comes up with (extreme being the keyword, this ain't \"starvation mode\" from a reasonable caloric deficit over a longer period of time) for e.g. bodybuilding competitions.\n\n[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4989512/) is about \"Persistent metabolic adaptation 6 years after The Biggest Loser competition\" and also an interesting read :)\n\n(for the record, I'm no scientist and doped up on dayquil, so take all of this with a grain of salt or do follow-up research)",

I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

Some days were less than and some days were over 1200. I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

Some days were less than and some days were over 1200. I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening.

Some days were less than and some days were over 1200. I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

Some days were less than and some days were over 1200. I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

Some days were less than and some days were over 1200. I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",

Some days were less than and some days were over 1200. I thought it was a nifty little happenstance about averaging out until my inbox exploded when comments and messages calling me \u201cdelusional\u201d, \u201cnaive\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201cunhealthy\u201d, etc. Apparently because I ate 1600 Monday and like 750 on Thursday (while I was bedridden with a migraine and slept most of the day), I was restricting too much and promoting eating disorders and encouraging an unhealthy mindset and yeah. So my post was removed.\n\n\nAnd the next day I saw a post about someone who had a holiday celebration and ate over 3500 calories in one evening. Not much better imo but nobody attacked them for a binge session.",
