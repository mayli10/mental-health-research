Then they feel the need to tell me what they eat and then offer there healthy tips. So I put what they hand me in my cart and pretend like I\u2019ll buy it but once the person is out of site I go back to that isle to put the item back and continue my low calorie search.

It almost makes me feel superior to other shoppers.\n\nYesterday at the check out the cashier looked at my 50calorie bread and told me that their is another brand she buys for her keto diet that is low carb&sugar. I checked it out but it was 90cal a slice. Buying my 50cal bread and knowing I could eat 2slices for 100 cal versus her 180cal made me feel smarter & better somehow.",

I never watched her so I don\u2019t know if she ate it all or if she used the bathroom after (she always sat at the table closest to the trash and the bathroom) but my heart goes out to her.

It almost makes me feel superior to other shoppers.\n\nYesterday at the check out the cashier looked at my 50calorie bread and told me that their is another brand she buys for her keto diet that is low carb&sugar. I checked it out but it was 90cal a slice. Buying my 50cal bread and knowing I could eat 2slices for 100 cal versus her 180cal made me feel smarter & better somehow.",

It almost makes me feel superior to other shoppers.\n\nYesterday at the check out the cashier looked at my 50calorie bread and told me that their is another brand she buys for her keto diet that is low carb&sugar. I checked it out but it was 90cal a slice. Buying my 50cal bread and knowing I could eat 2slices for 100 cal versus her 180cal made me feel smarter & better somehow.",
