                "Text": "I relate! I personally was at my sluttiest when I was also at my heaviest. Pardon the TMI, but I went from a virgin who'd only ever kissed one guy to a huge slut (I use the term lovingly lmao) who'd racked up a body count of 15 in my four years of college. I was also binge drinking and eating absolute GARBAGE. Like, idk how I survived. I swear to God I didn't eat a single vegetable in four years besides lettuce on burgers lmao. I wasn't relapsing with restricting. So naturally, I gained weight. And I was self-conscious about my body.\n\nWhen I relapsed last year, I got down to my lw since middle school. I had sex with my ex-boyfriend. It was weird because it was the first time I'd ever had sex (1) at such a low weight and (2) during a relapse. And tbh, I spent the whole time hyper-aware of my body, but in a good way. I was drunk, so that's probably why. The whole time I was basically feeling myself up hahah. Like, I think I ran my hands over my own body to feel my bones and how thin I'd gotten more than I touched my ex. Tbh, I felt really confident and sexy (the alcohol definitely helped) and I wanna get to my GW too so I can fuck someone and feel that way again. I know a lot of people say you'll still feel self-conscious and fat, even at your GW. But I had a totally different experience. ",
