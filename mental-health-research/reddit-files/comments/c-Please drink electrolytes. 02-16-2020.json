                        "Text": "I haven\u2019t had an EKG since the last time I was hospitalized, but I definitely noticed a fluttering in my chest and palpitations for years afterwards. I stopped purging almost completely (give or take a few \u201clapses\u201d) about two years ago, and I don\u2019t get that feeling much anymore, even with my massive caffeine intake! I only get the palpitations and dizzy feeling if I\u2019m super dehydrated, sick, or having a panic attack now, so it can definitely improve with time and letting your body heal.",

I stopped purging almost completely (give or take a few \u201clapses\u201d) about two years ago, and I don\u2019t get that feeling much anymore, even with my massive caffeine intake! I only get the palpitations and dizzy feeling if I\u2019m super dehydrated, sick, or having a panic attack now, so it can definitely improve with time and letting your body heal.",

I stopped purging almost completely (give or take a few \u201clapses\u201d) about two years ago, and I don\u2019t get that feeling much anymore, even with my massive caffeine intake! I only get the palpitations and dizzy feeling if I\u2019m super dehydrated, sick, or having a panic attack now, so it can definitely improve with time and letting your body heal.",
