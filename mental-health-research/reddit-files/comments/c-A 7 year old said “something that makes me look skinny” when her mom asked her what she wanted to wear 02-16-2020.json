So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

I'm definitely starting to feel like it is a more achievable goal. I 100% plan to make being physically active a big role in my family activities (because I love being active and it's such a healthy lifestyle). I grew up in a \"we just aren't runners\" kind of home, where my mom used to play sports but we didn't, and there was not always a great deal of body positivity (my sister was overweight from childhood on and is very obese to this day). But I also do have to acknowledge that my food issues aren't generally about food and body, so therest a good chance if I can help my kids manage their mental health in general, this won't be an issue either way.",

I don\u2019t think calories or discussing needed to lose weight should be discussed with a child. It is tough though too bc some people are not going to develop an eating disorder just bc weight loss or calories are discussed with them.",

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own. (I had already been in charge of making sure I took my ADHD meds daily for a few years). So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed. Not saying there is an answer, just saying that it's such a complex issue.",

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

I agree completely with not saying negative things about yourself around your kids etc. I think that's a great way to go about it. It's just so hard in today's society. Also, what would you do if your kid was overweight? I definitely remember being at a dr's appointment at 13 and being told by the Dr that I needed to lose weight, and it was crushing. But also, like, I needed to lose weight to be healthy. It's such a hard situation.",

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own.

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own.

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

I'm definitely starting to feel like it is a more achievable goal. I 100% plan to make being physically active a big role in my family activities (because I love being active and it's such a healthy lifestyle). I grew up in a \"we just aren't runners\" kind of home, where my mom used to play sports but we didn't, and there was not always a great deal of body positivity (my sister was overweight from childhood on and is very obese to this day). But I also do have to acknowledge that my food issues aren't generally about food and body, so therest a good chance if I can help my kids manage their mental health in general, this won't be an issue either way.",

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own. (I had already been in charge of making sure I took my ADHD meds daily for a few years). So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed. Not saying there is an answer, just saying that it's such a complex issue.",

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

I'm definitely starting to feel like it is a more achievable goal. I 100% plan to make being physically active a big role in my family activities (because I love being active and it's such a healthy lifestyle). I grew up in a \"we just aren't runners\" kind of home, where my mom used to play sports but we didn't, and there was not always a great deal of body positivity (my sister was overweight from childhood on and is very obese to this day). But I also do have to acknowledge that my food issues aren't generally about food and body, so therest a good chance if I can help my kids manage their mental health in general, this won't be an issue either way.",

I agree completely with not saying negative things about yourself around your kids etc. I think that's a great way to go about it. It's just so hard in today's society.

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own.

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own.

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

It's so hard juggling a lot of pain that you have as a result of someone you genuinely love and care for and know cares for you in return. Like, my attitudes toward food/eating are so messed up and I've struggled with my weight all my life and a big portion of that was because of what I learned from/was taught by my mother, but like... I also know she didn't do it on purpose, it's because SHE also had those same struggles, and I love her but it's like, this burden isn't my fault, but it's nobody's fault, and I wish I had someone to blame, but it's my lonely responsibility now.",

                        "Text": "I get it a bit at a certain age. At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own. (I had already been in charge of making sure I took my ADHD meds daily for a few years). So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed. Not saying there is an answer, just saying that it's such a complex issue.",

                            "Text": "I completely agree!\n\nI wouldn\u2019t restrict food if my kid was gaining weight, rather just provide them with healthier options. Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

I'm definitely starting to feel like it is a more achievable goal. I 100% plan to make being physically active a big role in my family activities (because I love being active and it's such a healthy lifestyle). I grew up in a \"we just aren't runners\" kind of home, where my mom used to play sports but we didn't, and there was not always a great deal of body positivity (my sister was overweight from childhood on and is very obese to this day). But I also do have to acknowledge that my food issues aren't generally about food and body, so therest a good chance if I can help my kids manage their mental health in general, this won't be an issue either way.",

I agree completely with not saying negative things about yourself around your kids etc. I think that's a great way to go about it. It's just so hard in today's society.

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own. (I had already been in charge of making sure I took my ADHD meds daily for a few years). So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own.

So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",

I'm definitely starting to feel like it is a more achievable goal. I 100% plan to make being physically active a big role in my family activities (because I love being active and it's such a healthy lifestyle). I grew up in a \"we just aren't runners\" kind of home, where my mom used to play sports but we didn't, and there was not always a great deal of body positivity (my sister was overweight from childhood on and is very obese to this day). But I also do have to acknowledge that my food issues aren't generally about food and body, so therest a good chance if I can help my kids manage their mental health in general, this won't be an issue either way.",

Let me binge on candy, bought me treat food a lot, no restriction really whatsoever. If I wanted candy before dinner, then I ate it and still ate my meal. I was never overweight (or even a healthy weight) so I just completely ate to my bodies hunger cues and I was super active\n\nMy mom would tell me I needed to diet or give me weight loss pills bc SHE was obsessed with her weight so she thought I should be too, I guess?! She missed pretty much all of my school/ sport events and basically sat in her room 24/7 and wouldn\u2019t even eat dinner with us bc she hated herself for getting fat. I thought it was just bc she was always fucked up on pills (which she was) but I guess now she\u2019s apologized and says she was embarrassed that she got fat and didn\u2019t ever want to be seen\n\nI try to just take special \u201ctreat\u201d foods off of a pedestal and just have my kids eat when they are hungry and never force them to finish food. It\u2019s really hard though. \n\nIt is already hard though and my kids are just 2 and 3. If I ever have something negative to say about my body or things about food I don\u2019t want them to hear, I just don\u2019t say it around them or I\u2019ll spell the offending words so they don\u2019t hear it. \n\nI pretty much stopped weighing myself too bc they\u2019d want to do it after me. I weigh myself like twice a month now and when they do see (which they\u2019ve only seen like once in a few months) and weigh themselves I just tell them wow, you\u2019re growing so well! Just to make it positive and that we are just checking weight like the doctors check at their appts to make sure they\u2019re growing correctly \n\nSorry for the wall of text lol",

I don\u2019t think calories or discussing needed to lose weight should be discussed with a child.

At 13 I was getting more autonomy and doing things without my parents and basically should be reasonably expected to manage many of my own health concerns on my own. (I had already been in charge of making sure I took my ADHD meds daily for a few years). So at what age is it necessary to tell the child that they have to make better choices to control their own weight. A 12 year old is certainly going to notice if suddenly they are hungry and you tell them they can't eat anything more. Or they can't have that candy that they used to be allowed.

Maybe buy less snacks, have less (or no) candy in the house so it isn\u2019t telling them they can\u2019t have it, it just isn\u2019t available. Or start cooking healthier meals & pack their school lunch if they\u2019d been previously buying it at school so you know what they are eating.  Adding in more physical activity like walks as a family or pick up hiking or riding bikes as a family.. or try to get them more active. You can make these lifestyle changes for/ with your child as a way to be healthier without specifically commenting on their weight or body. If you teach them to live a healthy, active lifestyle they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about weight\n\nI do think you should teach children that some foods are more nutritious than others, such as an apple being better for you than candy, but still not put it on a pedestal like \u201cif you eat your carrots, then you can have icecream\u201d bc you\u2019re putting emphasis that the icecream is better and you only should eat the carrots to get the dessert.",
