Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories. Otherwise it would break the laws of thermodynamics.",

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories. Otherwise it would break the laws of thermodynamics.",

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories. Otherwise it would break the laws of thermodynamics.",

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

                        "Text": "Nooooo. Anything with calories by definition (and the laws of physics) will make you gain if you\u2019re above your TDEE. Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories. Otherwise it would break the laws of thermodynamics.",

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

It sucked visiting friends on vacation and having to do this.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to fathom how nearly everyone is okay with having food prepared by other people and having no idea of everything that\u2019s in their food, how much of certain ingredients is used, etc.  As a vegetarian it\u2019s especially tough to deal with because so many restaurants cook veggies with lard or meat broth.",

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.

Nuts have calories, so the excess energy has to be stored somewhere. Splenda has zero calories because our bodies can\u2019t get energy from it. If that were the case with nuts, they\u2019d also have zero calories. But one almond has 7.\n\n> Of these six nutrients, carbohydrates, protein and fats provide calories. Each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories/gram. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories.\n\n>A calorie is a measurement, just like a teaspoon or an inch. Calories are the amount of energy released when your body breaks down (digests and absorbs) food. The more calories a food has, the more energy it can provide to your body. When you eat more calories than you need, your body stores the extra calories as body fat. Even a fat-free food can have a lot of calories. Excess calories in any form can be stored as body fat.\n\nhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/4182-fat-and-calories\n\nIf a certain type of fat didn\u2019t lead to weight gain, it wouldn\u2019t have calories.
