                "Text": "OP, lots of white women coming in and listing their problem. They are just trying to be helpful, but, as a white woman myself, none of us can quantify or understand your suffering for being a POC. \n\nIt's ok to be frustrated because you're a POC and racism and prejudice is alive and well in this country (and world). Reading the news is terrifying and it breaks my heart. I cannot imagine what is like growing up as an innocent little girl and having almost all media being about pretty little white girls. And then hearing horrific things about police brutality, knowing loved ones who have lived through it, and experiencing prejudices in your day to day life. I cannot understand what it is like growing up for those first few years of childhood before you realize that prejudice is everywhere, and that somehow now you are even prejudiced against yourself in some ways, because you let some small splinter of the world's hatred turn into your own. There is no way for a white person to live in your shoes or quantify your life long experiences.\n\nDo not feel ashamed of your suffering, or of voicing your suffering as a POC. Just as woman are allowed to talk about rape and domestic violence in safe spaces for women without men saying, \"but men are domestically abused by woman too,\" you can experience your hardships and know that white people, no matter their own hardships, can never experience what you have been through because we are not POC.\n\nMy advice is to get a therapist, maybe a POC therapist, who can help you work through some of this. Good luck to you, OP. You are beautiful and right, it is this world that is ugly and wrong.",

Glad you all chimed in to tell us you can have mental health issues too.\n\n* We know that, privilege doesn't mean \"everyone of this group has a perfect life\" and if that's your knee-jerk reaction to that word you need to learn more about it\n\n* OP *says* without an ED, and yeah, probably meant \"mentally healthy in general\" which you can gather from the post. So if you're a white woman with an ED (probably a lot of you here on this ED sub) she already clarified she wasn't talking about your life because of that shared struggle.\n\nI know you guys didn't mean it, but this is a sort of \"not all men\" ish thread. There are experiences that come with being the \"ideal\" race and body type that just can't be replicated, even if there wasn't a \"not disordered\" clause. \n\nOf all places I thought OP would be able to express this in this sub without people coming out the woodworks to make her feel bad for it as if she said \"all white folks' lives are perfect.\" Y'all really won't appreciate nuance in disordered thoughts if it's about race when we get 5 \"I'm not talking about *you* when I call *me* fat\" posts a day?",

Because we all agree, eating disorders suck happiness out of everyone's lives.\n\nShe's trying to share her disordered thoughts here and white women have come out of the woodworks to say how their lives aren't that easy. When (a) she did specify about mental health issues, (b) those of you with mental health issues *still have white privilege,* and (c) I have never seen a defensive response to someone's disordered venting thoughts like this comment section. Not once. And it's surely the race thing. Because even the ones about weight don't get this, when a huge portion of ED sufferers are overweight.",
