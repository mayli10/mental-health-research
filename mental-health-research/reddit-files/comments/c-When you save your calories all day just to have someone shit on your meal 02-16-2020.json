                "Text": "Ugh, fucking hate this. I'll usually let go a little bit on Sundays because I go to my mom's house and I can't know the exact number of calories I'm eating. So I might go a little higher with my calories limit. One time I had just finished a three day fast and went back for a second bowl of (still fairly low calorie) soup at lunch with my mom and she said something like \"Wow, you sure are eating a lot. You must be really hungry!\" I feel like I can't even eat in front of my mom anymore because she always comments on my food. Sometimes I'll get myself a small bowl of ice cream after dinner and she'll say something like \"Oh, I wish I could have some, but it's so fattening!\" No, mom, it's only fattening for you because you also ate a \"healthy\" breakfast of 3 huge chocolate chip muffins today. Now fuck off and let me enjoy my treat in peace so I don't have to purge it later. ",
