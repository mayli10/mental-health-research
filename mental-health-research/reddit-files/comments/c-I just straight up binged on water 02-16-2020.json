                "Text": "Not to be the party pooper, but water overloading - also known as water intoxication or hyperhydration - can actually be quite dangerous and you should avoid that.\n\nSee, your kidneys can only manage and excrete excess water up to a certain point - around 1 liter per hour. Beyond that, water causes excessive dilution of sodium and important electrolytes in your blood. This in itself is a condition known as hyponatremia. When this happens, your body tries to regulate that by increasing water retention/edema in the peripheral regions of the body (such as the legs) and, most importantly, by increasing fluid shifts from the bloodstreams to the cells, which then begin to swell. Swelling can impact pressure and blood flows inside the brain, which in turn can result in a series of neurological symptoms which may vary from dizziness and mild nausea to seizures, coma and ultimately death.\n\nWater loading is a common technique used by anorexics in treatment centers before weigh-in to appear heavier than they are. There are girls who have lost their sight or suffered long-term brain damage from that.\n\nI myself have overloaded on water so many times, primarily because a huge part of my ED is drinking massive amounts of diet sodas to avoid eating. This of course becomes all the more intense the more weight I lose and the less I eat, and the effects are more severe if I haven't eaten and my stomach is empty. The first time it happened it was straight up terrifying: I didn't know what was happening and I started experiencing horrible nausea to the point that I couldn't even sit up (but I still couldn't vomit); I also couldn't even see and think straight and had trouble breathing. I thought I was having some sort of stroke and I was about to call an ambulance. Then I peed and after a couple hours I started feeling somewhat better but it didn't completely go away until the following morning.",
