I have had issues with food since I was about 13 years old but it really ramped up again last year following a second spinal surgery and then an emergency surgery 3 weeks later to address a life threatening infection. It's also where my addiction to laxatives started. I've lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months which doesn't sound like a lot but it is all very noticeable now even though I just hit a healthy BMI.\n\nThe comments are the worst part. I know that people think they are being encouraging, especially when they saw me at my highest weight, but saying things like \"you're withering away to nothing\" are really not helpful. We had a family party yesterday for my mom's birthday and my cousin actually made an offhand comment about having to stage an intervention for me before the night was over. It wasn't funny and it made me feel awful and awkward. Especially when I know how much I have been restricting, fasting, and using laxatives.\n\nThankfully I have one good friend who is in recovery herself and knows my whole story and is super supportive when I break down, which is quite a bit lately. She lets me know that my ED is valid, even if I don't feel that way and has been gently pushing me to start thinking about getting real help. I'm finally starting to consider it just because I don't know how much longer I can go on doing what I'm doing. It's exhausting but I know that I won't stop on my own...\n\n",

Hell, I'm trying to drop as much weight as possible before I meet with my new psychiatrist because I want to seem legit and feel valid. My biggest fear is telling someone the truth and them not taking me seriously or thinking I'm faking or an attention seeker. I feel like they'd just say \"you don't look like you have an ED\" and dismiss me. \n\nIt's really hard because the media tends to focus on anorexia and when most people think of an ED, they equate it with being malnourished and underweight. It's not really understood that weight isn't indicative of severity and that weight loss is simply a symptom. Because EDs are mental. In reality, most people won't ever be underweight because they have BED, bulimia or OSFED/EDNOS. But the world acts like anorexia is the only ED that exists. We as sufferers tend to internalize that and we invalidate our own suffering because of it. ",

When I first got sick I was happily losing tons of weight, and when anorexia switched to bulimia I got scared about how out of control I was (and that I might put on weight lol) so went to the doctor. My weight was so low I was taken super seriously and given an appointment almost immediately when waiting lists are usually months long.\n\nBut then, when my weight recovered (mostly through binging, no healthy habits whatsoever and definitely not in any way recovered), I was discharged and had to kind of deal with it all on my own. I stumbled about for years at a low level, high functioning bulimia.\n\nRecently I went back to the doctor to get help because I couldn't take it any more and it was getting way worse due to stress etc. Was waved out of the room and told to keep an eye on it and track my weight. Absolutely no recognition of the pure mental torture side, they just seem to care how close you are to actually dying and then they might intervene.\n\nNot to be a debbie downer, but this is my experience and the experiences of many other people I've heard. \"Don't be afraid to get help, it's available\" my butt.",
