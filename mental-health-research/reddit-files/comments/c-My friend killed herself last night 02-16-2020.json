Support means so much, and I'm happy you're looking for some \u2764\ufe0f\n\nFor what it's worth, I just want to say that your post made me feel less alone in my situation. It's hard, and I have no idea how to cope with it. I'm sure you're struggling a lot too. But the feeling of being able to reach out is tremendously helpful. \n\nPlease know that people care about you\n\nIt's so hard to understand, and even harder to accept. I wish you the absolute best in dealing with your grief, and I hope you find peace. \n\nI don't know if it helps you to know we're in the same boat, but please feel free to PM me if you need to.\n\nI'm so sorry this has happened.

All of the interests I have are because of my aunt. Additionally, she struggled with mental illness but seemed to be successful and happy despite it. My mom would often give me pep talks about my own mental illness by saying \"look at your aunt...if she can overcome her mental illness, you can, too!\" Then, when I was 18, my aunt took her own life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward 4 years. I had been dating a guy on and off for about 8 years at that point. He ended up going to jail for a crime that I find morally reprehensible, so we were in our longest \"off period\" following that. When he got out of jail, he called me the next day (I clearly remember it was a Tuesday). He told me he loved me and that he wanted my forgiveness. I couldn't forgive him. They found his body a week later, but police estimate that he killed himself that Tuesday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my life, I've had a lot of people die, but the suicides are different. I feel responsible for them no longer being with us. Like I don't blame myself for my grandma dying of cancer, but I somehow feel responsible for my aunt and boyfriend losing their lives.  I'm in my 30's now and I'm still plagued with the what-ifs. Don't be like me. Celebrate her life, remember the good times you shared, but don't dwell on what you could have done. And if you want  to talk, I'm here.",

                "Text": "I'm sorry for your loss. Today is actually the date that someone close to me committed suicide. Not a friend, but a family member. I hope you and your friends can find comfort in each other. I've find comfort in songs as well (I can write them down if you'd like).\n\n While I don't know your friend, I know some people can tend to re-analyze a person's behaviour after they have killed themselves and paint a constant shadow over their being, as though that person must have been very unhappy all the time. Instead of thinking that you should have seen that something was wrong, I hope you can see her smiles and enthusiasm as a proof that she also had glimpses of light in her life, and that you as her caring friend very likely contributed to that.\n\n I also thought of this quote I saw by Amy Winehouse's family member, at least it has resonated with me:\n\n  \u201cThere are times when Amy catches me unawares. She\u2019s right in front of me and in a second I am overwhelmed. This feeling comes with no warning. There is no route map for grief. There are no rules. I can\u2019t predict what might trigger this: her face flashed up on the big screen at the BRIT Awards; a song of hers playing in the airport lounge en route to New York; the Japanese tea set she bought me from a junk shop that I stumble across while sorting through a cupboard at home; the mention of her name. Whether these moments are intensely public or intensely private, they stop me in my tracks, and I am paralysed with emotion. Yet I find them strangely comforting. They are a reminder that I can still feel, that I am not numb. I worry about a day when that might change. I worry about the day when Amy stops being alive in my head and in my heart. I don\u2019t want that day ever to come. I don\u2019t think it ever will. I loved her. I will always love her, and I miss everything about her.\u201d",

I am not sure if your friend ever sought help, but so many people don't.
