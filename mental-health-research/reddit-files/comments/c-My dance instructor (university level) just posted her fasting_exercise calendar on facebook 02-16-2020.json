This contradictory attitude towards food (\"I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do\") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.\n\nI hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning. The trouble is whether anyone above your teacher would listen or care, if they aren't already tacitly allowing it to happen.",

                        "Text": "It's not nessesarily bad. Depends what you're doing/how long you've been fasting for, and what your weight is. Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

This contradictory attitude towards food (\"I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do\") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.\n\nI hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning. The trouble is whether anyone above your teacher would listen or care, if they aren't already tacitly allowing it to happen.",

Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

This contradictory attitude towards food (\"I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do\") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.\n\nI hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning. The trouble is whether anyone above your teacher would listen or care, if they aren't already tacitly allowing it to happen.",

                        "Text": "It's not nessesarily bad. Depends what you're doing/how long you've been fasting for, and what your weight is. Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

This contradictory attitude towards food (\"I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do\") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.\n\nI hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning.

Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

This contradictory attitude towards food (\"I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do\") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.\n\nI hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning. The trouble is whether anyone above your teacher would listen or care, if they aren't already tacitly allowing it to happen.",

This contradictory attitude towards food (\"I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do\") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.\n\nI hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning. The trouble is whether anyone above your teacher would listen or care, if they aren't already tacitly allowing it to happen.",

Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

Technically, exercising before breakfast can be considered exercising in a \"fasted state\". And endurance athletes will also do it to train their bodies to more comfortably utilize their fat reserves during sustained bouts of activity where they're inevitably going to run out of carbs to burn anyway. (And trust me... it helps. After running fasted for most of a year- even when not restricting- I \"hit the wall\" WAY less hard).\n\nBut yeah, an 8 day fast when instructing dance and doing your own exercise regime is probably a bad idea XD Maybe it'd be kinda safe if you were at a relatively high weight, but dance instructors don't tend to be. And even if you are overweight/a normal weight, extended fasts need medical supervision.",

This contradictory attitude towards food (\"I have to tell you to nourish yourself because it's my job but I also can't stop myself from making judgemental comments about your bodies when you do\") is pretty standard for someone who doesn't recognise they have disordered eating behaviours, which is likely if she's sharing an 8 day fast like it's no big deal. This damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't projection of eating onto other people is telling. She might even subconsciously be doing it to make herself feel better - if she makes sure you all have eaten breakfast, then her fast is somehow even more meaningful.\n\nI hope you're getting an overall positive experience out of this class otherwise, because this behaviour is concerning.
