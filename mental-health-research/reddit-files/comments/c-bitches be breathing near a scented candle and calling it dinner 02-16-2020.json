She's a dermatologist but she is so obsessed and over the top with skincare and sunscreen and it seems to be mostly motivated by fear and control. Idk it's hard to explain but if you watch a couple of her videos you'll probably see what I mean, she just seems generally mentally unwell with control issues. That combined with her exercise and diet stuff and how skinny and gaunt she is just screams ED to me.",

She's had a lot of work done, veneers, etc. This isn't confirmed but I know many other Youtubers do it; I believe she uses filters on her videos and thumbnails to look more healthy and professional. You can see exactly where her cheek fillers are because she's so skinny. I think she's gained some fat (def less lean now) since becoming vegan and basically eliminating all fat and most protein from her diet.\n\nAdmittedly, I always thought she was \"goals\" despite knowing to everyone else, she was very shocking to see (more so a few years ago than now). She wears tinted moisturizers now too when previously she never wore face makeup, so you can't see how discoloured her skin actually is. She has veneers so you cant see how damaged her teeth are.\n\nShe's a fake. While she doesn't owe anyone her life story, I'm disgusted people like her can make a living off marketing their illness. No, it's technically not her main grab but people with EDs naturally gravitate to people like her.",

You never saw the character, but she was described as an underweight socialite, and the barista mentions \u201cshe was so frail, the poor thing could only take in a whiff of the coffee before leaving it\u201d.

She's had a lot of work done, veneers, etc. This isn't confirmed but I know many other Youtubers do it; I believe she uses filters on her videos and thumbnails to look more healthy and professional. You can see exactly where her cheek fillers are because she's so skinny. I think she's gained some fat (def less lean now) since becoming vegan and basically eliminating all fat and most protein from her diet.\n\nAdmittedly, I always thought she was \"goals\" despite knowing to everyone else, she was very shocking to see (more so a few years ago than now). She wears tinted moisturizers now too when previously she never wore face makeup, so you can't see how discoloured her skin actually is. She has veneers so you cant see how damaged her teeth are.\n\nShe's a fake. While she doesn't owe anyone her life story, I'm disgusted people like her can make a living off marketing their illness. No, it's technically not her main grab but people with EDs naturally gravitate to people like her.",

She's had a lot of work done, veneers, etc. This isn't confirmed but I know many other Youtubers do it; I believe she uses filters on her videos and thumbnails to look more healthy and professional. You can see exactly where her cheek fillers are because she's so skinny. I think she's gained some fat (def less lean now) since becoming vegan and basically eliminating all fat and most protein from her diet.\n\nAdmittedly, I always thought she was \"goals\" despite knowing to everyone else, she was very shocking to see (more so a few years ago than now). She wears tinted moisturizers now too when previously she never wore face makeup, so you can't see how discoloured her skin actually is. She has veneers so you cant see how damaged her teeth are.\n\nShe's a fake. While she doesn't owe anyone her life story, I'm disgusted people like her can make a living off marketing their illness. No, it's technically not her main grab but people with EDs naturally gravitate to people like her.",

She's had a lot of work done, veneers, etc. This isn't confirmed but I know many other Youtubers do it; I believe she uses filters on her videos and thumbnails to look more healthy and professional. You can see exactly where her cheek fillers are because she's so skinny. I think she's gained some fat (def less lean now) since becoming vegan and basically eliminating all fat and most protein from her diet.\n\nAdmittedly, I always thought she was \"goals\" despite knowing to everyone else, she was very shocking to see (more so a few years ago than now). She wears tinted moisturizers now too when previously she never wore face makeup, so you can't see how discoloured her skin actually is. She has veneers so you cant see how damaged her teeth are.\n\nShe's a fake. While she doesn't owe anyone her life story, I'm disgusted people like her can make a living off marketing their illness. No, it's technically not her main grab but people with EDs naturally gravitate to people like her.",

She's had a lot of work done, veneers, etc. This isn't confirmed but I know many other Youtubers do it; I believe she uses filters on her videos and thumbnails to look more healthy and professional. You can see exactly where her cheek fillers are because she's so skinny. I think she's gained some fat (def less lean now) since becoming vegan and basically eliminating all fat and most protein from her diet.\n\nAdmittedly, I always thought she was \"goals\" despite knowing to everyone else, she was very shocking to see (more so a few years ago than now). She wears tinted moisturizers now too when previously she never wore face makeup, so you can't see how discoloured her skin actually is. She has veneers so you cant see how damaged her teeth are.\n\nShe's a fake. While she doesn't owe anyone her life story, I'm disgusted people like her can make a living off marketing their illness. No, it's technically not her main grab but people with EDs naturally gravitate to people like her.",
