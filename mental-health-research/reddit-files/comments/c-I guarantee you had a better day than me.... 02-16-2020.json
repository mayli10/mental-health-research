I thought I was strange because I can\u2019t really relate. I know we all have different eating/exercising/supplementing habits so I figured that\u2019s why I can\u2019t relate. Anyway, if I don\u2019t have any bowel movements for a days to a week I honestly feel fine, not sore or bloated. I guess there\u2019s just nothing in me. But most the time, especially lately, I have to have a small bowel movement every time I use the washroom. I never feel like I need to, it just happens when I\u2019m already on the toilet. Is this strange? \n\nGawd I hope I don\u2019t ever have any unexpected diarrhea public moments! I\u2019m embarrassed for you, I\u2019d die. Think you\u2019ll ever go back there?",

There have been people in Walmart who just pull their pants down in the middle of the aisle, shit and piss on the floor, and continue shopping like nothing happened, which honestly is so much worse considering it wasn't even an accident- they just don't care.  It's odd.\n\nIt'll be okay and you are not alone at all :') \ud83d\udc95 I hope you can go back soon and not have to be too embarrassed!",
