I completely get your worry about wanting to be the best role model for them and worrying that you may influence them negatively, but you ARE being an amazing role model. Having someone early on watching it for them and teaching them to move past the skinny/fat comparisons is such a great thing for them to be learning at that age. You\u2019re a wonderful person for being so caring and mindful around them and teaching them things many others neglect to.",

                "Text": "I started thinking I was fat in second/third grade, ages 7-8. \nThat\u2019s exactly when an eating disorder first begins to plant the \u201cI\u2019m too big/fat/much\u201d seed in humans\u2019 brains. \n\nKeep being the positive role model you are. Keep reminding them that if they\u2019re getting a little big, it\u2019s their body using storing energy to get ready for a growth spurt. \nJoke about how you used to weigh 80 pounds as an 8 year old and by the time you were 11 you were 110. Whatever truths it takes to make them think their changing and soon to be changing bodies are normal (because it is!!)\n\nYou have an opportunity to positively affect these girls for the rest of their lives and I am immensely proud that you are taking every reasonable action. Thank you. \n\nMy 8 year old self thanks you. \nAnd those girls, when they are old enough to understand, will thank you. ",

                "Text": "You are doing a good job by being delicate with your words and not framing being thin or light in a positive way.  Kids pick up on so much, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re already curious or envious of your body type.  Not talking about it or directly saying heavy is okay is the best way to prevent the girls from trying to emulate you, but you might want to be prepared for if/when one of the children asks you directly why you don\u2019t eat or don\u2019t eat healthy amounts.\n\nI have a 2 year old and she\u2019s already noticing that I don\u2019t eat with her and my husband at breakfast and lunch or snacks.  She\u2019s starting to take her own food and hold it up to my face saying \u201ceat mama!\u201d It\u2019s such a tricky and heartbreaking situation to deal with because with an ED I don\u2019t want to be my child\u2019s role model in regards to food but I also want to guide her to eat healthy and be healthy.  I can see you\u2019re struggling with the same issue and I honestly don\u2019t know how to \u201cexplain around it\u201d if directly asked why I don\u2019t eat or told to eat by a child.  For now all I\u2019ve got is deflection. ",
