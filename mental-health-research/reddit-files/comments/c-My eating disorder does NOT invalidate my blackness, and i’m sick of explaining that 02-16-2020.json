It must be exhausting to have to not only live with an ED but also fucking justify the fact you have an ED (to family who should fucking just accept you anyway...). I hope you're finding some chances to enjoy the holiday.\n\nThanks for posting this, though. And thank God for subs like this where the real people with EDs can represent. Strangers being open on the internet have helped me so much over the years just by sharing their own ED experiences. It's important!",
