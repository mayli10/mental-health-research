I wonder if they're encouraging everyone as self-critical as they are. Society normalises \"weight loss is everyone's goal\" and has made it really acceptable.\n\nNo one ever says they want to put on weight, or they know they're too thin, or they have an eating disorder. I think the distorted perceptions people have of themselves as being \"fat\" when they're far from it, and them finding fault with themselves is triggering. My self-dialogue is complicated, it's for therapy or whatever.\n\nPeople who have unhealthy goals and can't see how thin they are have driven me berserk. If you say nothing, people are going to put you in some category and make assumptions to fill the silence. If people were like \"SI rocks!\" \"it has to be deep\" that would sound fucked up, where as all of the above isn't as obvious- it's similar",

I think it\u2019s a really interesting side of the disorder that isn\u2019t discussed enough - the way people perceive your disorder can later affect your own perception of the disorder and can negatively impact your recovery if your disordered behaviours were accepted. It sounds really tricky and must feel really invalidating, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve experienced this. Diet culture really fucks with ED recovery.
