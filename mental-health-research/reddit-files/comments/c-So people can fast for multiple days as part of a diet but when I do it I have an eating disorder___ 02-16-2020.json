It\u2019s also pretty likely that lack of regular and nutritious meals contributed to this in one capacity or another. I don\u2019t think anyone can truly say someone got to 500lbs without some disordered habits. \n\n>I agree with the idea that our bodies weren't meant to have access to food 24/7 & make out life an all you can eat buffet lol it makes sense to me to have times of feast vs fast. \n\nDo you not believe that human biology has evolved a bit in the thousands of years since the introduction of agriculture? \n\n>To give our bodies time to digest and use what we store.\n\nThis is fluid. Our bodies use what we store as we move through our lives. Fasting doesn\u2019t affect that process; it just doesn\u2019t replace what we use.

Even if they fast for days.\n\nEhhh but we\u2019d say someone who is 100lbs shouldn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s also pretty likely that lack of regular and nutritious meals contributed to this in one capacity or another. I don\u2019t think anyone can truly say someone got to 500lbs without some disordered habits. \n\n>I agree with the idea that our bodies weren't meant to have access to food 24/7 & make out life an all you can eat buffet lol it makes sense to me to have times of feast vs fast. \n\nDo you not believe that human biology has evolved a bit in the thousands of years since the introduction of agriculture? \n\n>To give our bodies time to digest and use what we store.\n\nThis is fluid. Our bodies use what we store as we move through our lives. Fasting doesn\u2019t affect that process; it just doesn\u2019t replace what we use.

Even if they fast for days.\n\nEhhh but we\u2019d say someone who is 100lbs shouldn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s also pretty likely that lack of regular and nutritious meals contributed to this in one capacity or another. I don\u2019t think anyone can truly say someone got to 500lbs without some disordered habits. \n\n>I agree with the idea that our bodies weren't meant to have access to food 24/7 & make out life an all you can eat buffet lol it makes sense to me to have times of feast vs fast. \n\nDo you not believe that human biology has evolved a bit in the thousands of years since the introduction of agriculture? \n\n>To give our bodies time to digest and use what we store.\n\nThis is fluid. Our bodies use what we store as we move through our lives. Fasting doesn\u2019t affect that process; it just doesn\u2019t replace what we use.
