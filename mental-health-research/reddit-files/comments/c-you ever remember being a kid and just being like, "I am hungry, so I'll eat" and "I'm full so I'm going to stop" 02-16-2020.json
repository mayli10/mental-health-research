My foster mom reported that finding an entire packet\u2019s worth of Kraft cheese single wrappers hidden in the couch was a common occurrence. They had to hide the food because I would sneak and binge it all... from a 3 year old. According to many state therapists, food was my replacement for the love I never received. It led to shoplifting food from a young age, and later a second and then a third ED. Still struggling separating my emotions from food 22 years later.  It has never been about how society views me.",

My foster mom reported that finding an entire packet\u2019s worth of Kraft cheese single wrappers hidden in the couch was a common occurrence. They had to hide the food because I would sneak and binge it all... from a 3 year old. According to many state therapists, food was my replacement for the love I never received. It led to shoplifting food from a young age, and later a second and then a third ED. Still struggling separating my emotions from food 22 years later.  It has never been about how society views me.",

My foster mom reported that finding an entire packet\u2019s worth of Kraft cheese single wrappers hidden in the couch was a common occurrence. They had to hide the food because I would sneak and binge it all... from a 3 year old. According to many state therapists, food was my replacement for the love I never received. It led to shoplifting food from a young age, and later a second and then a third ED. Still struggling separating my emotions from food 22 years later.  It has never been about how society views me.",

I have trouble wrapping my mind around how I had such a scarcity mindset around junkfood even though I grew up in a middle-class, 2-parent household. My parents tried to teach me healthy eating, not allowing me more than a serving of junk food in a sitting and trying to get me to eat fruits and veg but I feel like I was such an addict from a young age, always craving. Why didn\u2019t I learn moderation?",

My foster mom reported that finding an entire packet\u2019s worth of Kraft cheese single wrappers hidden in the couch was a common occurrence. They had to hide the food because I would sneak and binge it all... from a 3 year old. According to many state therapists, food was my replacement for the love I never received. It led to shoplifting food from a young age, and later a second and then a third ED. Still struggling separating my emotions from food 22 years later.  It has never been about how society views me.",

I have trouble wrapping my mind around how I had such a scarcity mindset around junkfood even though I grew up in a middle-class, 2-parent household. My parents tried to teach me healthy eating, not allowing me more than a serving of junk food in a sitting and trying to get me to eat fruits and veg but I feel like I was such an addict from a young age, always craving. Why didn\u2019t I learn moderation?",

My foster mom reported that finding an entire packet\u2019s worth of Kraft cheese single wrappers hidden in the couch was a common occurrence. They had to hide the food because I would sneak and binge it all... from a 3 year old. According to many state therapists, food was my replacement for the love I never received. It led to shoplifting food from a young age, and later a second and then a third ED. Still struggling separating my emotions from food 22 years later.  It has never been about how society views me.",

I have trouble wrapping my mind around how I had such a scarcity mindset around junkfood even though I grew up in a middle-class, 2-parent household. My parents tried to teach me healthy eating, not allowing me more than a serving of junk food in a sitting and trying to get me to eat fruits and veg but I feel like I was such an addict from a young age, always craving.

My foster mom reported that finding an entire packet\u2019s worth of Kraft cheese single wrappers hidden in the couch was a common occurrence. They had to hide the food because I would sneak and binge it all... from a 3 year old. According to many state therapists, food was my replacement for the love I never received. It led to shoplifting food from a young age, and later a second and then a third ED. Still struggling separating my emotions from food 22 years later.  It has never been about how society views me.",

My foster mom reported that finding an entire packet\u2019s worth of Kraft cheese single wrappers hidden in the couch was a common occurrence. They had to hide the food because I would sneak and binge it all... from a 3 year old. According to many state therapists, food was my replacement for the love I never received. It led to shoplifting food from a young age, and later a second and then a third ED. Still struggling separating my emotions from food 22 years later.  It has never been about how society views me.",

I can't remember making those decisions, because at the time I would have been learning them, my life was chaos and I was never comfortable and had nobody consistently looking after me.

I had an aunt that told me about Twiggy, the model, and that she only ate \"one strawberry a day\". Being a chubby little girl in a bathing suit, hearing that from my beautiful, successful aunt (who was also my caretaker at the time) was incredibly influential. I didn't associate food with weight until the very first time I learned about AN, and that someone had died from it\n\nThat very day, when I was \\*maybe\\* 10 years old, I decided that I wanted to die of AN.\n\nSo, I wish I could have those memories, but I don't really. It makes it hard to \"go back\" to a normal relationship with food, because as soon as I became aware of food/weight/life/happiness/etc I decided that I wanted it to kill me. \n\nMaybe this was meant to be sarcastic by the OP, but it felt food to write that out.",
