There's no point, it's not healthy, it's not productive, it skews your perception, it's very not good. Have to keep reminding yourself.\n\nSmall tip, keep a note where you tally how many times per (timeframe) you weigh yourself. I track my repeat daily weigh ins. It puts it in perspective. Embarrassing how often I can weigh myself in a single day. Before I didn't give very much thought to it, simply a bad habit.

                "Text": "THANK YOU. I really think that the way people stray from the fact that weight IS cico is genuinely a bad thing -both within ED communities and outside of it. So many people think that weight has little to do with calories, or it's genetic, or it's entirely hormonal or whatever. The biggest excuse I see is medication, but I can guarantee you that the medication doesn't cause weight gain; it causes an appetite increase and/or water retention. \n\nWithin ED communities, this can cause people to restrict EVEN MORE because they feel desperate. This causes health problems and just generally makes their lives more miserable. Outside ED communities, I've seen it a lot where overweight or obese people genuinely believe they cannot lose weight, which ALSO causes a lot of health problems and will make their lives more miserable - show me a morbidly obese person who's comfortable in their body and I'll show you a liar. And then there's the \"naturally skinny\" people who just reinforce the idea that it's genetic; you're not naturally skinny, you just eat less than you realise. It's that simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Thank you for this. CICO is all it is and it upsets me when people say otherwise, because that narrative is damaging to EVERYBODY.",

Not concerningly low (I did it real sneaky on a single day of hanging out), but very slightly below his TDEE.

Really wasn\u2019t helpful for young overweight me, but probably was just misinformation too.

But the difference isn\u2019t enough to really see practically. If you\u2019re at a deficit you will see loss corresponding to that amount. Give or take some small variation for a number of factors of which this is just one. \n\nLong term though it all works out to be roughly the same. It\u2019s not gonna be the difference between a pound projected and half a pound actual. More likely the difference between a pound projected and 0.975 lbs actual. If that much even. That much could easily end up accidentally balanced out by other factors. \n\nI don\u2019t want to minimize your concerns, but I hope you can keep in mind that these differences are not nearly as large or significant as your ED might make them seem \u263a\ufe0f\n\nETA: Even the absolute *most* severe (relatively rare) metabolic disorders will only take you from a projected 1lb to 0.8lbs. Which is certainly not no loss and is far from gaining.",
