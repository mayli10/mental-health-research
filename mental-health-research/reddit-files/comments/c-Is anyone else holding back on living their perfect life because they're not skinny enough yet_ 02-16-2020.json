I've experienced depression, from mild to debilitating, both when underweight and when chubby (as I am the last 6 months or so), a few times over, and everything always DOES feel better when underweight. \n\nThese days I tell myself I am now \"allowed\" to dress nicely (lol actually this doesn't have a lot to do with my being allowed or not; I've gone 2 sizes up during these sick, binging months and none of my cute, skinny clothes fit me), nor to fully experience my life. Gotta go back to starving for at least 3 months before I feel even remotely \"entitled\" to it.\n\nReally fucking sad.",

I'm not at my low weight anymore, not at my high weight either, and I have a boyfriend, tattoos, I go swimming if I want to (although it's triggering af sometimes, once I get in the water it's ok), I'm going skating as soon as I can convince people to come with. Still not 100% ok but...the world didn't end because I did these things and I didn't hate myself more for allowing myself to do them, despite not being tiny enough (in my mind).",
