But if you feel you want to work on recovery at least a little bit, and want to let someone in, it can be pretty great. \n\nAfter fully explaining it to my boy, it sort of put a lot into light for him, I think. It gave him the chance to be able to see that I'm deeply struggling with this stuff, and that my heavy restriction and then binging isn't just because I'm trying some crash diet and then getting too hungry and overeating. \n\nI explained the compulsions and the anxieties about all the aspects of my ED and how it was the same as depression and anxiety: you know what you need to do to be healthy, but you can't just make your brain see it that way and turn it all off. \n\nI think driving home the idea that it isn't just some attempt at a crash diet or something really helped things click into place for him. I think before that, he thought I was just stuck in a \"try to diet hard, get too hungry, start binging\" loop, rather than the reality: \"eat less and less or you're a failure, have one inconvenience, eat everything in sight for days because you suck anyway so why not\" \n\n(Disclaimer: that's the internal ED gremlin voice, not me saying that.)",

It gave him the chance to be able to see that I'm deeply struggling with this stuff, and that my heavy restriction and then binging isn't just because I'm trying some crash diet and then getting too hungry and overeating. \n\nI explained the compulsions and the anxieties about all the aspects of my ED and how it was the same as depression and anxiety: you know what you need to do to be healthy, but you can't just make your brain see it that way and turn it all off. \n\nI think driving home the idea that it isn't just some attempt at a crash diet or something really helped things click into place for him. I think before that, he thought I was just stuck in a \"try to diet hard, get too hungry, start binging\" loop, rather than the reality: \"eat less and less or you're a failure, have one inconvenience, eat everything in sight for days because you suck anyway so why not\" \n\n(Disclaimer: that's the internal ED gremlin voice, not me saying that.)",

My heart breaks for your daughter that she had to experience that. \n\nI hope she's doing better now and that the next person she is with treats her right, instead of cutting her down like that!\n\nEdit: in case it wasn't clear, my experience was with a guy who has been an ex for about 7 years now.

But if you feel you want to work on recovery at least a little bit, and want to let someone in, it can be pretty great. \n\nAfter fully explaining it to my boy, it sort of put a lot into light for him, I think. It gave him the chance to be able to see that I'm deeply struggling with this stuff, and that my heavy restriction and then binging isn't just because I'm trying some crash diet and then getting too hungry and overeating. \n\nI explained the compulsions and the anxieties about all the aspects of my ED and how it was the same as depression and anxiety: you know what you need to do to be healthy, but you can't just make your brain see it that way and turn it all off. \n\nI think driving home the idea that it isn't just some attempt at a crash diet or something really helped things click into place for him. I think before that, he thought I was just stuck in a \"try to diet hard, get too hungry, start binging\" loop, rather than the reality: \"eat less and less or you're a failure, have one inconvenience, eat everything in sight for days because you suck anyway so why not\" \n\n(Disclaimer: that's the internal ED gremlin voice, not me saying that.)",

I think before that, he thought I was just stuck in a \"try to diet hard, get too hungry, start binging\" loop, rather than the reality: \"eat less and less or you're a failure, have one inconvenience, eat everything in sight for days because you suck anyway so why not\" \n\n(Disclaimer: that's the internal ED gremlin voice, not me saying that.)",

You are on an eating disorder sub. \n\nIdk what you are doing lurking around in an ED sub and making weird assumptions and accusations, but this isn't the place. Everyone here struggles with umhealthy eating behaviors. Many of us have friends, family, or significant others who know about it and help us through it. Such as someone who struggles with any mental illness. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, what have you. A loved one creating a safe space and helping us to work through our anxieties and issues is not codependency, it is bring supportive even when you don't understand something.",
