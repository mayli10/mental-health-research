                "Text": "In my experience a lot of girls on campuses feel social pressure to engage in what we might think of as disordered behaviours under the guise of being healthy. Like, their whole friend group is doing IF or keto so they feel like they should do it too and they\u2019re all \u201cgym buddies\u201d so there\u2019s a pressure to work out with the same frequency that your friends are.  Coupled with people who forget to eat when they get really into something, who stop eating under a lot of stress, high-level college athletes, and all the walking university students typically do, and it makes sense why they are a lot of super skinny but not technically eating disordered people on college campuses.  \nBut also, a study I read found that \u201c[prevalence estimates of current EDs among college students range from 8% to 17%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3721327/), so it\u2019s also that there may be more people with EDs around you as well.",

You know that I'm not chubby based on my stats and what I described. I know that you're not chubby based on your stats and how you described them. \n\nObviously we both have body dismorphia.

A drunk girl followed me (another female) into the bathroom, I complained it smelled like puke, and she explained to me how girls normally make themselves puke if they\u2019re too full/drunk so that they can drink/eat more.\nI consider that to be disordered behavior.\nBinge drinking/eating and then Purging multiple times in one night (consistently over a whole semester) leaves a lot of girls skinny since their parents aren\u2019t there to make sure they\u2019re eating properly.\n\nI knew of a girl whose boyfriend was so adamant she stay skinny\u2014even if it meant puking her guts up every night\u2014that she pretty much broke her gag reflex. If she got drunk enough, she would (literally) slowly and steadily puke on herself all the way back to her dorm after a night out, she\u2019d even smile through the vomit if she had fun that night. It got so bad that her friends were losing sleep just to make sure she wouldn\u2019t choke on her vomit  in the middle of the night and die.",

You know that I'm not chubby based on my stats and what I described. I know that you're not chubby based on your stats and how you described them. \n\nObviously we both have body dismorphia.

Look, I just took pics of myself this morning, I'm only the tiniest bit taller than you are, and we do the same sports.

You know that I'm not chubby based on my stats and what I described. I know that you're not chubby based on your stats and how you described them. \n\nObviously we both have body dismorphia. I know, I know, it's really hard to remember that but im trying to be that voice from a stranger that shakes you today and says \"dude. Stahp. You literally know better.

Look, I just took pics of myself this morning, I'm only the tiniest bit taller than you are, and we do the same sports. Now I know I'm not the skinny iconTM that I wish I was, but I also know, *logically*, that I'm not chubby. I wish my ED brain could recognize that. However, we can help each other. You know that I'm not chubby based on my stats and what I described. I know that you're not chubby based on your stats and how you described them. \n\nObviously we both have body dismorphia. I know, I know, it's really hard to remember that but im trying to be that voice from a stranger that shakes you today and says \"dude. Stahp. You literally know better. Pls. \u2764\ufe0f\" So please, never tell me what it's like at 18.4. If you haven't already, please *never find out what it's like* at 18.4",

Look, I just took pics of myself this morning, I'm only the tiniest bit taller than you are, and we do the same sports. Now I know I'm not the skinny iconTM that I wish I was, but I also know, *logically*, that I'm not chubby. I wish my ED brain could recognize that. However, we can help each other. You know that I'm not chubby based on my stats and what I described. I know that you're not chubby based on your stats and how you described them. \n\nObviously we both have body dismorphia. I know, I know, it's really hard to remember that but im trying to be that voice from a stranger that shakes you today and says \"dude. Stahp. You literally know better. Pls. \u2764\ufe0f\" So please, never tell me what it's like at 18.4. If you haven't already, please *never find out what it's like* at 18.4",
