Then I swear I\u2019m going to just chill and eat and not count the calories. \n\nThen I eat, but feel guilty as hell with each bite and worry that I\u2019m being obvious and not acting normal.\n\n Then I spend two hours after I get home trying to remember everything I ate, guess the portion size, then search recipes to figure out calorie counts and enter them into my phone. \n\nThe worst was guessing a meal my MIL made that was apparently from The Pioneer Woman. I can\u2019t remember exactly what, but there were two meats\u2014braised ribs and something else, plus sides and rolls. Dessert was these canned peaches wrapped in crescent rolls and cooked in a pan with something like a cup or two of sugar, (some butter?), and bottle of Sprite. Then, we\u2019re sitting around talking after dinner and she busts out chips and guacamole *and* caramel cheddar popcorn. Omfg. I didn\u2019t stand a chance! Guacamole is my eternal downfall.\n\nI get stressed, but she\u2019s a super nice lady and she\u2019s sensitive about how her (admittedly tasty) cooking is received, so unless it\u2019s actively on fire or trying to bite me back, I\u2019ll always eat her food. It\u2019s the only time I feel less guilty eating than not. I couldn\u2019t stand hurting her feelings. \n\nI just won\u2019t eat for most of the next week to make up for it.",
