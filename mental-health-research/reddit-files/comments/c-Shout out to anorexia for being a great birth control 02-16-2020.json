That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself.

Turns out that being underweight and constantly stressed out because of university is not great for your hormones. I also have PCOS on top of this, so that's extra awesome. \n\nThe silver lining is that there's 0 risk of pregnancy, so after the appointment me and the boyfriend enjoyed some guilt free, nasty unprotected sex. I'm VERY thankful to still have my sex drive, otherwise I would've jumped off of a cliff a long time ago \ud83d\ude43",

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself. And remember that you are fucking stronger than that disease and you deserve better, queen!",

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself. And remember that you are fucking stronger than that disease and you deserve better, queen!",

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself. And remember that you are fucking stronger than that disease and you deserve better, queen!",

That shit scared the hell out of me and as much as fear may not always be the best motivation, it worked for me. And I knew that the worst came to worse, I'd never have children but I was committed to try and reverse the process, I knew I could do it. Apart from infertility, which may not bother some, there's the issue of osteoporosis, which you get when you're not menstruating and your hormones are out of whack.\nYou are strong as fuck. Set your mind on recovery but because that's a relatively vague goal - pick something more tangible. For me it was getting my period back. I'm sure you'll find something for yourself. And remember that you are fucking stronger than that disease and you deserve better, queen!",
