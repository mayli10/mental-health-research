EDs have been there all along, even if they haven't been officially diagnosed by a professional. They are all still valid and a nightmare to deal with. I wish I could just sit down and eat like everyone around me, but I can't keep binging and overeating as the norm. The average person doesn't cry over food and hate themselves for eating something they enjoy.",

Even when you get to UW people don't understand what UW even looks like and can write you off. \n\nIn all cases it's not about how you physically look, it's about the mental turmoil it causes. Which is typically something we keep to ourselves and hard for others to see. You cant diagnose other mental illnesses by looking at someone, same goes for EDs. \n\nBuuuuuut, I still invalidate mine because *~I'm NoT sKiNNy~*",

I wish I had access to my old blog cuz I clearly remember writing that it's the ppl closest to us who fuel our EDs with the compliments and more interest in us as we continue to deteriorate.

Extra annoying though as a lot of them know I have an ED (my mum being shit at keeping things quiet).

Maybe not for everyone, but sometimes my family are a little too comfortable making those kind of jokes, possibly because a lot of my family members are overweight/obese and think it's okay to make those comments if you're not. Extra annoying though as a lot of them know I have an ED (my mum being shit at keeping things quiet). I'm a perfectly healthy weight and it's quite clear that these sort of jokes make me upset and uncomfortable.",

Maybe not for everyone, but sometimes my family are a little too comfortable making those kind of jokes, possibly because a lot of my family members are overweight/obese and think it's okay to make those comments if you're not. Extra annoying though as a lot of them know I have an ED (my mum being shit at keeping things quiet). I'm a perfectly healthy weight and it's quite clear that these sort of jokes make me upset and uncomfortable.",
