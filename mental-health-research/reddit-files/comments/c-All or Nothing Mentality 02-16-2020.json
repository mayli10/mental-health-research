No official ED diagnosis, mostly because I never brought it up in therapy and because I don't feel like I would be taken seriously because I have a high BMI. But I do the typical thing in BED circles of restricting or fasting and then binging because I finally ate real food.\n\nI struggle a lot with perfectionism and maintaining a certain image. Because my BPD tells me if I am not perfect,  I am not worth loving. Everyone I know and care about will hate me etc etc etc.\n\nI usually count calories/macros in MFP and it does make my brain freak out to see that that I gone over my calories or ate too much fat or sugar. The hardest thing in the world is to cut myself a break. Going 300 calories over my budget is not the end of the world. It's maintaining and that is okay. \n\nMy problem is that I want to lose weight and lose weight fast (because I want to be perfect. I want to be good at everything. I want people to praise and validate my fucking existence. But those low cal restriction days push me over the edge and next thing you know, it's 4am and I am eating twizzlers in a Wal-Mart parking lot contemplating suicide cuz fatty is eating candy again.\n\nIt sounds stupid, but moderation is hard. I don't like this all or nothing mentality and it will destroy me if I let it. I will probably never be thin but I am finally under 200 pounds.I haven't been this size since high school, so slowly and surely , I will work my way down and hopefully I can learn to go a little easy on myself.",

I wanted to be the little goth kid, but I felt like I had to perform that character constantly \u2014 I couldn\u2019t, like, wear a dress one day if that was what I was feeling. Sometime in my senior year of high school I decided that I would try to stop caring about having a consistent aesthetic, and then after that I would get comments from people about how different I look from day to day (especially in college, when I was switching back and forth between doing femme looks and doing more masculine looks). But for a long time it was like, I couldn\u2019t plan my outfits for the week ahead of time, because I didn\u2019t know who I would feel like I was on any given day until I woke up that morning.\n\nAnyway, not sure how this happened, but this feeling does seem to have gone away \u2014 I no longer feel as much like I\u2019m picking out a personality or character when I put my clothes on in the morning, which is kind of nice.",
