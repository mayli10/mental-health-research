When I was vegan I was really chubby, so it threw people off when I told them (then they would act like I was crazy for being on \"that diet\"). I ended up switching back to being vegetarian. But now I'm a lot thinner compared to back then, and people keep mixing the terms together, so when they notice that I don't eat meat, they'll ask if I'm vegan. Maybe, instead of answering, I should ask them, \"Are you an omnivore?\"\n\nI wish people could just enjoy their food and stop focusing on other peoples plate :( because their comments are usually intended to insult you lol.",
