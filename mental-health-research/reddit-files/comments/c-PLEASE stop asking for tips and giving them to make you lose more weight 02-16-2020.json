                        "Text": "What if excess weight is causing negative effects and the tips on how to lose weight is actually harm reduction? I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight. I think it's more complicated than \"no weight loss tips, period\".",

We aren't \"pro-ana/mia/ed\". To turn your point back around, it would be like someone saying they needed to *gain* weight and someone else responding that they just need to binge day in and day out.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

Well .. just stop eating so you don't purge!). Because technically, it *is* harm reduction but... To what extent, you know?\n\nIt's very hard to find that \"grey area\" with things when it comes to eating disorders which is why I think that there are some people who really do think they're helping but...

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

Well .. just stop eating so you don't purge!). Because technically, it *is* harm reduction but... To what extent, you know?\n\nIt's very hard to find that \"grey area\" with things when it comes to eating disorders which is why I think that there are some people who really do think they're helping but...

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

However, there are people who will post things that are obviously \"diet tips/tricks to lose weight\" and doctor it up enough to make it look like \"harm reduction\" (example: oh you want to quit purging? Well .. just stop eating so you don't purge!). Because technically, it *is* harm reduction but... To what extent, you know?\n\nIt's very hard to find that \"grey area\" with things when it comes to eating disorders which is why I think that there are some people who really do think they're helping but...

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

However, there are people who will post things that are obviously \"diet tips/tricks to lose weight\" and doctor it up enough to make it look like \"harm reduction\" (example: oh you want to quit purging? Well .. just stop eating so you don't purge!). Because technically, it *is* harm reduction but... To what extent, you know?\n\nIt's very hard to find that \"grey area\" with things when it comes to eating disorders which is why I think that there are some people who really do think they're helping but... There's those others who *know* what they're doing and that's what needs to stop. \n\nI want everyone on this sub to be able to speak their minds without fear of getting banned or downvoted into oblivion but we have to think about the livelihood of others.",

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

Well .. just stop eating so you don't purge!). Because technically, it *is* harm reduction but... To what extent, you know?\n\nIt's very hard to find that \"grey area\" with things when it comes to eating disorders which is why I think that there are some people who really do think they're helping but...

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

However, there are people who will post things that are obviously \"diet tips/tricks to lose weight\" and doctor it up enough to make it look like \"harm reduction\" (example: oh you want to quit purging? Well .. just stop eating so you don't purge!). Because technically, it *is* harm reduction but... To what extent, you know?\n\nIt's very hard to find that \"grey area\" with things when it comes to eating disorders which is why I think that there are some people who really do think they're helping but...

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

However, there are people who will post things that are obviously \"diet tips/tricks to lose weight\" and doctor it up enough to make it look like \"harm reduction\" (example: oh you want to quit purging? Well .. just stop eating so you don't purge!). Because technically, it *is* harm reduction but... To what extent, you know?\n\nIt's very hard to find that \"grey area\" with things when it comes to eating disorders which is why I think that there are some people who really do think they're helping but...

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

I know the population of this sub might not reflect it, but BED/EDNOS is by far the most common ED and some people suffering from it do get to weights that are as dangerous as being very underweight. Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

Hell, sometimes people develop restrictive disorders while still being very obese, and their weight is still killing them because it doesn't fall off overnight.

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

For anyone with an eating disorder (and I mean any of them), giving any sort of \"weight gain/loss\" tips is probably not in anyone's best interest because we really don't *know*. For some people, a \"normal\" weight loss tip would be \"eat healthy, drink lots of water, exercise\". For someone with an eating disorder, it could be the same formula with completely different variables and we could honestly think that we are doing the right thing because our minds are so warped. And no, we are not crazy, we have a disorder that truly warps our way of thinking, especially in terms of health.\n\nDespite struggling with an eating disorder for ~13 years, I only heard about MPA about a year ago (although I definitely found my own \"pro\" corner of the internet when I was a teen). I decided to check it out and I, like you, made the decision to stay away from it. Despite being in the throes of a horrible relapse, I just know that if I fall down the MPA rabbit hole, it will stick with me (just like the sites I found almost a decade ago) and recovery/maintenance will be much harder in the future. \n\n\u2665\ufe0f",
