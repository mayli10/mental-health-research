Like, if you want the T to be effective you have to eat enough and eat healthy. There will be some changes regardless, but you don't want to stunt your growth. Transitioning is literally a second puberty. Taking hormones activates your body's signals to grow. If your growth plates haven't fused than you can still see changes to bone structure. If you want facial changes or wider shoulders or something then you'll want to be able to grow. Some stuff will grow no matter what, but you could stunt your growth with your ED. I'm pretty sure that happened to me as I've seen almost no changes since I started restricting. I think maybe my eyes got a little bigger and maybe my hips got like a fraction of an inch wider. Stuff was going very fast before that though. I hadn't even started taking estrogen when changes started. I just lowered my body's testosterone. So to almost stop after a year around the same time my ED started makes me think the ED was partly responsible.",

Like, if you want the T to be effective you have to eat enough and eat healthy. There will be some changes regardless, but you don't want to stunt your growth. Transitioning is literally a second puberty. Taking hormones activates your body's signals to grow. If your growth plates haven't fused than you can still see changes to bone structure. If you want facial changes or wider shoulders or something then you'll want to be able to grow. Some stuff will grow no matter what, but you could stunt your growth with your ED. I'm pretty sure that happened to me as I've seen almost no changes since I started restricting. I think maybe my eyes got a little bigger and maybe my hips got like a fraction of an inch wider. Stuff was going very fast before that though. I hadn't even started taking estrogen when changes started. I just lowered my body's testosterone. So to almost stop after a year around the same time my ED started makes me think the ED was partly responsible.",

Transitioning is literally a second puberty. Taking hormones activates your body's signals to grow. If your growth plates haven't fused than you can still see changes to bone structure. If you want facial changes or wider shoulders or something then you'll want to be able to grow. Some stuff will grow no matter what, but you could stunt your growth with your ED. I'm pretty sure that happened to me as I've seen almost no changes since I started restricting. I think maybe my eyes got a little bigger and maybe my hips got like a fraction of an inch wider. Stuff was going very fast before that though. I hadn't even started taking estrogen when changes started. I just lowered my body's testosterone. So to almost stop after a year around the same time my ED started makes me think the ED was partly responsible.",

Transitioning is literally a second puberty. Taking hormones activates your body's signals to grow. If your growth plates haven't fused than you can still see changes to bone structure. If you want facial changes or wider shoulders or something then you'll want to be able to grow. Some stuff will grow no matter what, but you could stunt your growth with your ED. I'm pretty sure that happened to me as I've seen almost no changes since I started restricting. I think maybe my eyes got a little bigger and maybe my hips got like a fraction of an inch wider. Stuff was going very fast before that though. I hadn't even started taking estrogen when changes started. I just lowered my body's testosterone. So to almost stop after a year around the same time my ED started makes me think the ED was partly responsible.",
