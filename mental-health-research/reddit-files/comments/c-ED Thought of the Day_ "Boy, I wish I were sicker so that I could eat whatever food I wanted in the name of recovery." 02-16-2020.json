I also feel like I need to be sickly skinny in order to give myself permission to binge- but as soon as I do, I feel like I automatically gained all the weight back and it still isn't worth it. It creates a negative cycle and it's not sustainable- and that's really what we want... To stay a certain UGW. The more we dicipline ourselves to eat healthy and not restrict to the point where our survival mode kicks in to start binging than I think that's what would be ideal.",

ED's dont care what size you are, you will never be skinny enough/have enough symtptons/etc. One thing my therapist said to that helped me is, \" At what point will it take?\".   As you prob know, each step in ed is a new 'normal' that should'nt be. \n\nI understand where your coming from and support your journey because I'll be real, took me a longggg time to even consider recovery.",

I also feel like I need to be sickly skinny in order to give myself permission to binge- but as soon as I do, I feel like I automatically gained all the weight back and it still isn't worth it. It creates a negative cycle and it's not sustainable- and that's really what we want... To stay a certain UGW. The more we dicipline ourselves to eat healthy and not restrict to the point where our survival mode kicks in to start binging than I think that's what would be ideal.",

It creates a negative cycle and it's not sustainable- and that's really what we want... To stay a certain UGW.
