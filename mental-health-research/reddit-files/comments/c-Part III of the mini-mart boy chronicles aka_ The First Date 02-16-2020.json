This is amazing!! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I first started hanging out and talking, this is exactly how we were on our first few dates. We talked about EVERYTHING and were already completing each other\u2019s sentences. I felt (and still feel) that he was my soulmate. It was so euphoric and amazing, and it still feels this way 6 years later. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve met someone who could be your *person*. Congratulations! I can\u2019t wait to hear more about your experiences that you\u2019re willing to share.",

We literally went to McDonald's haha It was shockingly comfortable, seeing as we were two introverted, awkward people with heavy emotional baggage. We broke all the \"first date rules\", skipped the small talk and just opened up about the real shit. It's now been 5 years and I still feel this incredibly strong emotional and intellectual connection that continues to grow stronger. We don't fight or argue, we communicate constantly and never forget how much we love and respect each other. I absolutely believe in soulmates because she's literally it. We are inseparable. I hope that this it for you. I wish you all the love that I've been blessed with. Please continue to update us! This warmed my heart today \ud83d\udc95",
