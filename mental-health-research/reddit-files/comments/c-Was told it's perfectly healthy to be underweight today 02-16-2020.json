Also if you look at a lot of the most popular posts on porn subs, the girls definitely look underweight. It's disgusting and disheartening that what MANY men are attracted to is synonymous with an unhealthy, disordered, painful existence. This knowledge is a big thing that fueled my eating disorder, and I'm working on not caring about being attractive and perfect to guys now. The ones who care so much are the ones who shouldn't matter!",

Being a little bit underweight or overweight is fine for some people because not all bodies are the same, but in general it's better to stay within the healthy weight range for your height. Bonus fact, I'm super into making healthy meal plans and so I know exactly how difficult it is to stay healthy with the number of calories underweight girls tend to eat in a day. I made a plan recently for a girl who's severely underweight just as a way to at least improve her health from where she's at now and it was extremely difficult to get all of the nutrients she needed without reaching a normal amount of calories. I had to use a few different supplements and still couldn't get the calories low enough to an amount that she might actually be willing to eat.",

                "Text": "Well, I'll agree with him, as long as you're eating normally and you don't have, you know, anorexia nervosa, being under weight isn't inherently bad. There's a difference between eating so little that you're literally dying because you don't have any body fat and you don't eat enough to sustain yourself and being a person who just happens to have a very low body fat percentage. There are a lot of men and women out there who are just very thin, and get a lot of hate for being that way because people somehow assume it's by choice. The fact is, there's nothing unhealthy about being innately thin. Think about what you said, and imagine if it was the opposite. \"She's pretty but she's distractingly fat\" would probably be grounds to be offended. For the vast majority of women who are technically underweight, they're not mentally ill or malnourished and dying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Imo women can be beautiful wether you're thin, fat, or in between. But it's not *being* thin under weight or over weight that makes you beautiful, and I think it's pretty hypocritical of us to say all underweight women are only that way because they have eating disorders and it's disgusting.",
