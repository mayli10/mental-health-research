The fact that only 1.4% of the population is underweight makes that kind of thinlogic pretty rare in comparison to the 70% who are overweight and above.",

And for all they say they don\u2019t promote unrealistic body standards, they totally do - I\u2019ve seen so many women strive to look like VS models, who literally cut and fast for weeks leading up to the show. Most of them are underweight. And the men encourage it, saying that if Karlie Kloss can do it, why not every other woman?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think it\u2019s great to set goals for yourself! (If these ladies said they wanted to just lower their body fat percentage or work on getting abs, I would support it 100%.) I also totally respect the models for all their hard work.
