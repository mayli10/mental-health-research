Ever since I started restricting my calories, I found myself subconsciously eating slower and slower because I wanted to make the experience of eating last as long as possible. Now, I can go to a build-your-own pizza joint and make 1 slice last for the entire time it takes for my friend to finish their entire pie.

                "Text": "A quick guide to helping you put some time on your eating:\n\u2022 VOLUME FOOD. Low calorie, but takes a while to get it all down. For example, soup. Get some progresso light and fill your spoon with 1 solid peice at a time, along with the broth. \n\u2022 Or have veggies! Broccoli is my fave. Steam it. Onion/garlic powder. Boom. Then, since its made up of \u201cbranches\u201d cut off each small branch off the big ones (not the little rice-grain bits, I mean the smallest segment where theres still a stalk). Should take you at least 5 minutes to finish a big stalk (50 ish cals)\n\u2022 Whenever eating with knife/fork, cut the food into pieces no wider than your fork points. So about 1 square inch. No need to have a perfect measurement, but try to aim for that.\n\u2022 try to make the trip from plate to mouth as long as possible. Bagel? Cut it in half, Tear one piece off at a time. (Ive also notices this prevents the whole thing from being squished down when you bite it, so what you have left to eat looks bigger than it would!) Do this with as many foods as you reasonably can\n\u2022 ideally, do not eat anything that you take an actual bite out of, like a sandwich. Thats too easy to wolf down quickly. If you are eating a traditional \u201cfinger food\u201d rip pieces with fingers\n\u2022this last tip applies to any kind of food: drink something between bites! If you feel yourself getting a little too frenzied as you eat chug down a few gulps. Even if it doesnt slow you down you\u2019re more likely to take a breather before you get too carried away because your stomach will fill up faster\n",

                "Text": "I listen to a Danish podcast with a nutritionalist and a personal trainer who specializes in weight loss, it is amazing and has helped me a lot with my binging. They have an episode where they discuss this, they explain how people have different \"cues\" while eating, this basicly means that people focus on different things while eating. So some people might fokus all their attention on the food while others focus more on the social aspects of the meal or maby a show or something. According to them these \"cues\" is something we have from how we where raised to see and experience food, so if you grew up on a home where the focus of dinner was to talk to each other and not to eat you will be much better at controlling yourself around food because when you are eating you are not concentrated on the food nut for instance the company.\n\nAccording to them these habbits can Alto be learned.",
