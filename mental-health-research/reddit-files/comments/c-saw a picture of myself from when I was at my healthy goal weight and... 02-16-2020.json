We always hear about people seeing lower weight pictures of themselves and being motivated to lose weight, so it's great to hear the opposite. \n\nI look at pictures of myself at a healthy weight (my original GW) and I think I look great. I look radiant and even, dare I say, \\*hot\\*. I remember when people used to be attracted to me and when I used to date and have fun and smile. We're our own recovery inspo!\n\n:)",

                "Text": "I can relate. I posted a pic to the thinspo subreddit when I was at a healthy weight as a reminder to myself that I looked better at a healthy weight than underweight. (*It was pretty well-received for a quarantined sub too.*) I still feel like I looked better at a healthy weight. I kind of relapsed, but I still feel that I look worse now. I'm not completely sure why I even want to lose weight still. I guess I have some ideas, but nothing that makes too much sense. I wish I could have maintained that weight, but my relapse happened after losing a bunch of weight due to poor health and being mistreated by a new doctor I started seeing shortly after. Being at a healthy weight is a lot nicer though. My ED brain may tell me that being thinner is always better, but consciously I look at myself now and I feel that I'm too thin. I also don't even really have boobs so it's not like I carry a significant amount of weight on my chest. I'm somewhere around a BMI of >!16!< now but I bet I look like an average person a couple points higher normally would. I already went down a pants size from what was previously the smallest size and tightest fit I could find in my length, but now all the jeans I bought about >!15-20!< lbs ago are so loose on me. Well, I could swear my legs don't look any thinner, but I guess the evidence is pretty undeniable. Even pairs I've almost never worn are looser. It feels so wasteful. It's not like skinny jeans look like regular jeans when they get loose. They just looks bad. So I look worse and I'm less fashionable from losing weight. It's definitely motivation to try to at least stop losing, but I'm not so sure that I actually can.",
