Why are so many people failing to reach AND MAINTAIN their goal weight?? We (the consumer) are told it's our fault because at the end of the day it's about /our/ will power and /our/ ability to CICO.  But we also live in an capitalist space that doesn't want us to have dream body, in fact it redefines what the dream body is every few years to make sure the majority doesn't have it.\n\n We live in a consumerism driven market.  There's profit to be made and products to be sold if people are struggling to achieve their goal weight.  Tell them weight loss is easy. Show them pictures of skinny models in athletic wear eating burgers who make it look effortless. (Keep the models' personal trainer, dietician, actual hardcore diet and exercise regime a secret!) It's just CICO.  Then the consumer doesn't acheive their dream body after exerting a considerable amount of effort, despite being told it's rather ~effortless~.  They'll feel like they're lacking something.  That's the moment: sell them a product, sell them a diet. It works we promise.  It doesn't work? Must be /your/ fault, its just CICO.",

I am already eating a lot of salad to make me feel a little fuller, but after an hour I am just as hungry as I was beforehand.   \nWhen I eat normally, like really normal, always when I am hungry, but not tooo much, not too much sweets, a fruit snack in between or something like that. I am gaining weight, because it's always more than 1200kcal. When I try to maintain a healthy weight, I'm already kinda starving, because I have to skip breakfast... \n\nIt's so easy for me to eat way more than 2000kcal...

The math is stacked against us.\n\nI read that 1200cal is the recommended minimum regardless of height because that's the baseline most bodies need to just function well.

With 3500cals in a lb, and a daily deficit of 200cal, it would take me 175 days (almost half a year) to lose 10 lbs the 'recommended healthy' way. \ud83d\ude33 \n\nI can also overeat to 2000cal pretty easily.
