More so than women ever are, even the crazy man hating ones aren't as bad as a typical user on Incel subreddits or 4Chan. No, not all men are assholes. And women are just as mean to each other sometimes (SkinnyGossip comes to mind) But honestly grow a thicker skin if this is gonna upset you so much. This is mild compared to how men talk about women in male dominated spaces. Doesn't make it right, but sorry that's the internet for you.",

More so than women ever are, even the crazy man hating ones aren't as bad as a typical user on Incel subreddits or 4Chan. No, not all men are assholes. And women are just as mean to each other sometimes (SkinnyGossip comes to mind) But honestly grow a thicker skin if this is gonna upset you so much. This is mild compared to how men talk about women in male dominated spaces. Doesn't make it right, but sorry that's the internet for you.",

More so than women ever are, even the crazy man hating ones aren't as bad as a typical user on Incel subreddits or 4Chan. No, not all men are assholes. And women are just as mean to each other sometimes (SkinnyGossip comes to mind) But honestly grow a thicker skin if this is gonna upset you so much. This is mild compared to how men talk about women in male dominated spaces. Doesn't make it right, but sorry that's the internet for you.",

I was v fat so you can guess the shit they said about me. \n\nStupidly, they allowed one of our team mates into the group.

Very few people actually talk like that.\n\nYeah some do, but they're typically annoying as fuck and put everyone down to make themselves feel good. Man or woman. It sucks when you hear them yap about their wives \"oh that fucking cunt wanted me to mow the lawn during the pats game! What a dumb bitch!\" It's like, dude, that's your fucking wife. Show some respect you ungrateful dick.\n\nAnd I've seen the exact same out of girl friends as well. Normally that involves them cheating on their boyfriend's for revenge and put down. \n\nMen use words, women use actions. Both fucking suck and are shitty awful people. Cut them out of your life.",

And women are just as mean to each other sometimes (SkinnyGossip comes to mind) But honestly grow a thicker skin if this is gonna upset you so much.

Very few people actually talk like that.\n\nYeah some do, but they're typically annoying as fuck and put everyone down to make themselves feel good. Man or woman. It sucks when you hear them yap about their wives \"oh that fucking cunt wanted me to mow the lawn during the pats game! What a dumb bitch!\" It's like, dude, that's your fucking wife. Show some respect you ungrateful dick.\n\nAnd I've seen the exact same out of girl friends as well. Normally that involves them cheating on their boyfriend's for revenge and put down. \n\nMen use words, women use actions. Both fucking suck and are shitty awful people. Cut them out of your life.",

More so than women ever are, even the crazy man hating ones aren't as bad as a typical user on Incel subreddits or 4Chan. No, not all men are assholes. And women are just as mean to each other sometimes (SkinnyGossip comes to mind) But honestly grow a thicker skin if this is gonna upset you so much. This is mild compared to how men talk about women in male dominated spaces. Doesn't make it right, but sorry that's the internet for you.",
