It's his parents who choose everything he eats who are to blame. It's disgusting that they would shame him for it when children aren't in control of their diet. Like, what do you bet if he decided not to finish dinner because he wanted to lose weight that his parents would tell him to clean his plate? Most parents do, especially the ones who judge their children so harshly. I personally have great parents but even they would try to get me to eat everything they gave me even though I physically couldn't eat so much as a kid. It took ages for them to start giving me smaller portions.",
