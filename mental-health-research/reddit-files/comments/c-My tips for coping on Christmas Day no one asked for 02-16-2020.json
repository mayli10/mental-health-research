It has been keeping me from binging because I know it\u2019s coming and I\u2019ll do my best to not feel shit about it.\n\nFor Xmas day I\u2019ve planned my meals carefully to include a small choc in my stocking (I only put in the one!) and an individual dessert serving. A little bit of sugar will keep me focused and not feeling deprived, so I can otherwise fill up on salad. Much as I want to restrict, I\u2019m trying to focus on eating at maintenance and not feeling bad about myself. After Xmas I\u2019ll start my New Years resolutions early \n\nMerry Christmas to everyone.

I felt bad because she called to say she made sinigang for us (one of my favorite Filipino dishes), but she always uses the fattiest cut of beef and i could see all the oil separated from the broth. I just said I\u2019m ok, thank you and asked her how her kids were and stuff. I\u2019d usually give in to the guilt tripping or whatever, but it never ends well for me. And this year I\u2019m going to put my feelings first and not eat for others or whatever. Sorry, but I\u2019ve done that for too long and it ends now.

I'm currently freaking because I reached a new LW...actually my lowest adult weight and yesterday preceded to down 4000 cals of chocolate and sugar (damn you ferrero Roche) then this morning I'd only gained 2 lbs so I ate even more cookies!!! Just finished an intense treadmill and weights workout, currently soaking in the tub calculating the remaining weeks cals to stay in a deficit or at least maintenance.  I'm really sick of this illness ruining the holidays and family time!!",
