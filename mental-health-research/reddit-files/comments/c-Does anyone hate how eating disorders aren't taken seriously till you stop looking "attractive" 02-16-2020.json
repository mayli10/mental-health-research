It was such a nightmare. I literally learned to hate myself then. And the worst part was,,, I was a literal child. My parents would\u2019ve been the ones to warn about portion control or introducing me to more healthy varieties of food. Like ok yeah I hated and still hate lettuce, but had they introduced my to spinach??? Bro my life was changed. Green peppers are gross. Red peppers?? Bombbbbb.

They dont understand what it is how it affects people and manifests. They just see someone theh find hard to look at because of their size and decide its time to give an opinion and i hate it. I remember when i was at a lw at an old food service job id get customers all the time telling me i needed to eat something and it pissed me off because they were already in a power position as a customer and i hated how entitled they felt to tell me to eat",

She was a smart, educated woman--had a Ph.D in early childhood education--and was extremely proud of the fact that she knew the 'right' way to rear children.  Yet when her own child was sick to the point her stepdad tried to intervene, she made him back off. Even started actively trying to lose weight and then bragged about how little she was eating every day, like my weight loss was some sort of sick competition to see who could be thinner. She was proud to tell people how much weight I'd lost in so little time. \n\nOne teacher cared enough to get mad, scold me and call me out on it, but even then it happened only *after* I passed out in school. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44  Nothing happened afterwards, and now as an adult and a parent, I finally see how that shit is extremely negligent. \n\nThe red flags are *always* there.

It was such a nightmare. I literally learned to hate myself then. And the worst part was,,, I was a literal child. My parents would\u2019ve been the ones to warn about portion control or introducing me to more healthy varieties of food. Like ok yeah I hated and still hate lettuce, but had they introduced my to spinach??? Bro my life was changed. Green peppers are gross. Red peppers?? Bombbbbb.

It was such a nightmare. I literally learned to hate myself then. And the worst part was,,, I was a literal child. My parents would\u2019ve been the ones to warn about portion control or introducing me to more healthy varieties of food. Like ok yeah I hated and still hate lettuce, but had they introduced my to spinach??? Bro my life was changed. Green peppers are gross. Red peppers?? Bombbbbb.

She's like well you arent fat at all! \n\nIt's like uh people dont just gain a shit ton of weight overnight. I have no idea what I weight now but maybe close to 160?
