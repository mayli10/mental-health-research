I hate that girls compare themselves to each other. There is NO reason why we should. I honestly find girls who have sexy curves and an ass with thicker thighs to be more sexually attractive than super skinny girls. But the aesthetic of being borderline anorexic is so ingrained into our brains that, logically, that's how we want to be. I just keep in mind that my weight does NOT define me because it can literally change at any moment that I lose control and get unmotivated. Thinking about how people have seen me when I've been my lowest vs how they see me when I've been \"healthy\" or \"healthier\" just off sets me into a spiral of BPD thoughts and depression. Just see people for who they are, not their bodies.",

I really do feel the skinnier I get the more insecure other girls get, and the more weight I gain, the less respect I harness from them. That's why I try REALLY hard not to focus on what other people may be thinking unless they straight up tell me. I've caught myself feeling fat around girls who are skinnier than me and also caught myself feeling egotistical from being skinnier than other girls. It's a bad mind set that only adds another complex layer to having an ED.",
