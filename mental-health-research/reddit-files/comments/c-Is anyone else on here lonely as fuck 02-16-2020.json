                "Text": "Holy moly, I could have written this. I'm in pretty much the same boat right now. Broke up with my boyfriend in June because my mental health was too much for a relationship, it's definitely harder to find other singles when you're not in some sort of school or program. I'm not looking to get into a relationship right now, because I'm so messed up and I don't want to cause any more collateral damage.  My siblings are lovely and I love them to bits, but they too are in serious (like either married or have been together for 5+ years), and they have their own lives and I don't want to bother them with my stupid bullshit. \n\nAll my friends have either forgotten about me and don't respond when I've tried to reach out or they are busy being awesome and having kids or getting married or excelling in their careers. The good friends I do have are all over geographically, and I don't have any of my best friends near enough to visit often. \n\nI've tried to make new friends, but I have social anxiety and it's so hard when I've been in and out of the hospital for my mental health. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy ED is kicking my ass, and it's like everyone else got the memo that the success train was leaving and I didn't and I got left in the dirt and had to catch the depressed express train to Shitsville. It's so hard and I don't know why I'm restricting/ doing other ED behaviours either. I'm so stuck and I'm trying to rebuild my life, but it's exhausting and I don't have that much energy to spare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry this turned into a friggin essay, but I can relate so hard. I'm really sorry that you're feeling like this, OP. I really am. You're not alone though. I hope you have a nice day and maybe find something nice to do for self care :)",

Recently, though, I\u2019ve been more recurrently in a grey area where it\u2019s been easier to be myself, make friends, hang out with people. I think it may be because I\u2019ve completely given up on the idea of depending on human interaction/intimacy for my happiness. I don\u2019t know if this is the natural result of having too many almost-romances and almost-friends, or if it\u2019s mental illness, or budding self-sufficiency. I don\u2019t know if/when it gets any easier. Despite everything, I\u2019m still always on the edge of a panic attack about something or someone. I\u2019ve fluctuated between almost obese to almost underweight and my satisfaction levels have been about the same. The only thing that truly let me be at peace (relatively) was to stop looking outwardly for affection, and to start treating myself like my partner in crime.
