                "Text": "While I don't think going vegan can cure your ED I do know my most successful recovery period was helped greatly by transitioning to a vegetarian diet.\n\nIt gave me a way to feel good about eating that didn't just feel like code for \"get fat\". By choosing to eat morally it increased my self esteem and made eating part of my sense of self rather than something I wanted to cut out completely.\nIt also (and this is obviously very personal) forced me to give up a lot of my safe meals and eat a much wider variety of foods. \n\nI have never transitioned to full veganism though because I think that would do the opposite; force me to give up newly reintroduced foods and make me scrutinize all the food labels. Maybe if I ever consider myself \"cured\" and not in remission.\n\nThe vegetarianism alone would not have cured my ED, but it was a very helpful and powerful tool in my recovery and I'm very grateful I tried it.\n\nHowever:\nMany many people use vegetarian/vegan/allergy/paleo ECT diets to cover up their ED and enable it though. It's not a solution in and off itself, but I do think that with a recovery mindset and therapy it can be a powerful tool.",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

                        "Text": "No one should act holier than thou about any lifestyle on an ED sub, I totally agree. But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

So I feel bad if the quantity OR quality of my food is \"off\" at all... which is almost always; I never finish a day feeling like I've eaten \"perfectly.\"\n\nI feel best eating 99% plant-based and I don't think restrictive diets are inherently bad. But with my own ED, it's like... \"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail,\" or however that saying goes. I almost can't help to fuck up my relationship with food, regardless of *what* or even how much I'm eating.",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

You have no access to the thought processes underlying those choices. Seriously. Don\u2019t say that kind of thing in this community, please.",

Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

There are times that I deeply enjoy food, but then there are times when literally nothing feels safe and I feel like I must be going insane because I'm breaking down over a cup of boiled chickpeas or something. I'm not in treatment, but I'm slowly trying to work towards loosening some of my thought processes... it's not about the diet itself, but about the fact that I feel like I'd rather commit suicide than ingest something \"bad,\" you know? It's fine if I continue eating 100% WFPB in actual practice, but I want to know that theoretically I can eat whatever I want and it's not the end of the world.\n\nI really do feel like it's worse than straight-up calorie restriction because you can't just try to make stuff work mathematically, it's like the food has magical properties rendering it clean/unclean and yet these properties are only relative \u2014 nothing's perfectly pure. I hope for your sake that it doesn't end up manifesting in this particular way.",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

But I do respect your opinion and I enjoyed reading your thoughts! It\u2019s good to get different takes, I like being challenged in what I think. Good reminder to me not to be complacent and not to make assumptions that my recovery is any better than others\u2019 (I don\u2019t think I do, but honestly, it\u2019s possible). I know all the ways in which I\u2019m a mess!! And veganism does not fix them, haha. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

                        "Text": "No one should act holier than thou about any lifestyle on an ED sub, I totally agree. But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

                            "Text": "There are always going to be things that distress you in life. This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

And therapy is most helpful *after* nutritional repair.\n\nI would never directly recommend someone go vegan, but you are generalising a lot from your own experience. I know moving to full veganism helped me and has helped many of my friends (none of us bloggers or vloggers). That\u2019s anecdata, yes - but so is yours. Everyone\u2019s experience is valid here. :)\n\nedit: also it\u2019s really problematic to invalidate people\u2019s EDs if they do say veganism has helped. You have no access to the thought processes underlying those choices. Seriously. Don\u2019t say that kind of thing in this community, please.",

That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

So we are in serious agreement there. :) I do wholeheartedly agree that recovery is dumbed down af by a lot of people in popular venues like YT and IG, I guess that for me that\u2019s more a generic recovery vlogger, IGer etc issue rather than a vegan issue per se. But I do respect your opinion and I enjoyed reading your thoughts! It\u2019s good to get different takes, I like being challenged in what I think. Good reminder to me not to be complacent and not to make assumptions that my recovery is any better than others\u2019 (I don\u2019t think I do, but honestly, it\u2019s possible). I know all the ways in which I\u2019m a mess!! And veganism does not fix them, haha. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

It's fine if I continue eating 100% WFPB in actual practice, but I want to know that theoretically I can eat whatever I want and it's not the end of the world.\n\nI really do feel like it's worse than straight-up calorie restriction because you can't just try to make stuff work mathematically, it's like the food has magical properties rendering it clean/unclean and yet these properties are only relative \u2014 nothing's perfectly pure.

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

                            "Text": "No one should act holier than thou about any lifestyle on an ED sub, I totally agree. But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

But I do respect your opinion and I enjoyed reading your thoughts! It\u2019s good to get different takes, I like being challenged in what I think. Good reminder to me not to be complacent and not to make assumptions that my recovery is any better than others\u2019 (I don\u2019t think I do, but honestly, it\u2019s possible). I know all the ways in which I\u2019m a mess!! And veganism does not fix them, haha. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

                        "Text": "No one should act holier than thou about any lifestyle on an ED sub, I totally agree. But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s a good example of one. ",

That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

                        "Text": "No one should act holier than thou about any lifestyle on an ED sub, I totally agree. But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

There are times that I deeply enjoy food, but then there are times when literally nothing feels safe and I feel like I must be going insane because I'm breaking down over a cup of boiled chickpeas or something. I'm not in treatment, but I'm slowly trying to work towards loosening some of my thought processes... it's not about the diet itself, but about the fact that I feel like I'd rather commit suicide than ingest something \"bad,\" you know? It's fine if I continue eating 100% WFPB in actual practice, but I want to know that theoretically I can eat whatever I want and it's not the end of the world.\n\nI really do feel like it's worse than straight-up calorie restriction because you can't just try to make stuff work mathematically, it's like the food has magical properties rendering it clean/unclean and yet these properties are only relative \u2014 nothing's perfectly pure.

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",

But it\u2019s just as bad (if not more so...) to invalidate others\u2019 illnesses and attack entirely valid choices which are well documented at an anecdotal level to be helpful and beneficial for some individuals. That\u2019s not supportive either. It\u2019s not better to be vegan, in ED terms, I think you\u2019re completely right about that! (Is it better ethically? The majority of the time yes, but speaking strictly to the ED, there is no better or worse, there\u2019s just where one is with one\u2019s own illness and choices regarding it - sone want to get better, some don\u2019t.) Equally though, you can\u2019t expect it to go unchallenged when you generalise from your own experience with one approach and try to paint it as uniformly bad. It simply isn\u2019t. I completely accept and respect that it\u2019s bad *for you*. \n\nFWIW I have often encouraged people I know with EDs not to go vegan, or to explore the idea very cautiously, as I\u2019m very aware of the risks. It\u2019s possible to be someone who has personally benefited, without being dogmatic or seeing it as in any way a \u201ccure\u201d. \n\nThe \u201ccure\u201d for eating disorders is still unknown because they\u2019re primarily genetic. In essence at the moment they go into remission. We *manage* them, through ongoing nutritional therapy and in some people psychotherapy and/or medication. If sustaining that nutritional therapy is markedly easier for some individuals under a plant based model, that is valuable to know. ",

But I do respect your opinion and I enjoyed reading your thoughts! It\u2019s good to get different takes, I like being challenged in what I think. Good reminder to me not to be complacent and not to make assumptions that my recovery is any better than others\u2019 (I don\u2019t think I do, but honestly, it\u2019s possible). I know all the ways in which I\u2019m a mess!! And veganism does not fix them, haha. ",

This *sucks*, but it's something we have to learn to cope with in healthy ways.\n\nI can't tell you *how* right now, unfortunately. I've been kinda really deep in depressive swing and do not know how to cope with anything. That \"whack-a-mole\" term came from my therapist when she was (lovingly) berating me on how I just switch from one addiction to another (binge eating, self harm, drugs, alcohol, restriction) because I won't face the real issue, which is my terrible, horrible self-worth. \n\nI'm trying. But she makes me say things that are *good* about myself *out loud*, and that's really really hard because I usually feel like there's literally nothing good about me and even trying to make the words come out makes me cry like a big baby so... I have a lot of work to do. \n\nGet help. If you can't see a therapist or a school counselor, talk to your general practitioner, or another doctor or health professional. I worked at a locally owned pharmacy for a while, and it might be worth talking with the pharmacist and asking if they know anything about local eating disorder/mental health treatment resources if the internet fails you. \n\nIt may or may not be possible. I'm not here to tell you \"everyone has access to the help they need and if you don't have it you're doing something wrong\". That's fucked up and *is not what I'm saying*.  My point was just that, if there's any way for you to get help, don't listen to the disordered part of your brain telling you why you shouldn't. It's stupid and wrong and should not be listened to. Don't let *that* be what holds you back. \n\nIf nothing else, learn about treatment of eating disorders from a medical prospective. Read scholarly articles, controlled studies, anything you can find on the treatment of eating disorders. Become your own treatment specialist until you can get a professional. ",
