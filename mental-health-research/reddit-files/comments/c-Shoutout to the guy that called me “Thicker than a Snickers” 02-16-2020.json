Also don't quote me on this but I'm pretty sure the original was actually \"built like a brick shithouse\", and the ommission of shithouse was the more PG version for radio/everyday usage. [Here's a little history on the phrase](https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2458/how-did-the-phrase-built-like-a-brick-shithouse-get-to-be-a-compliment/), although I can't verify the accuracy.\n\nEither way though, I totally agree that it's a weird fucking thing to say haha",

[Here's a little history on the phrase](https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2458/how-did-the-phrase-built-like-a-brick-shithouse-get-to-be-a-compliment/), although I can't verify the accuracy.\n\nEither way though, I totally agree that it's a weird fucking thing to say haha",

Also don't quote me on this but I'm pretty sure the original was actually \"built like a brick shithouse\", and the ommission of shithouse was the more PG version for radio/everyday usage. [Here's a little history on the phrase](https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2458/how-did-the-phrase-built-like-a-brick-shithouse-get-to-be-a-compliment/), although I can't verify the accuracy.\n\nEither way though, I totally agree that it's a weird fucking thing to say haha",
