Whilst crying in the shower. \n\nDid it make me feel better in those fat moments? Maybe, it was a good way to externalise the self hatred and panic. But the truth was it was usually work stress or relationship stress that set it off. In those moments it\u2019s like impossible to have a relative understanding of your fat, your mind just zooms in 1000x on the problem areas, magnifying the curves and not noticing all of the angles that are there too. Your eyes aren\u2019t your friend, or your hands. At these moments a loose pair of pajamas and water and curling up in bed are your friend.\n\nYou\u2019re beautiful and I\u2019m sorry you feel that way too sometimes.",
