                "Text": "It's a bandaid solution that actually makes things worse over time, the control you have over food will diminish the more you purge. Our brain is constantly monitoring how much energy is coming in compared to how much is being eaten. This is how our appetite has evolved to naturally work: your brain knows that a certain amount of food has a certain amount of energy, and it becomes satisfied after enough energy has been consumed. \n\nWith purging you're essentially fooling your brain into thinking that a massive amount of food only has the small amount of calories that you fail to purge each time. As a long-term result you will become more obsessed with food and need to eat way more than before just to feel somewhat satisfied. This doesn't reverse immediately either, making weight gain more severe when you choose to stop purging due to all the other health complications. \n\nIt's also important to remember that bulimia recovery is a matter of when, not if. It's never ever a permanent solution, it's a demon that harms you the whole time you're doing it and for a long time afterwards. You will win absolutely nothing from it. Only a huge dentist bill and more weight gain in the long long term.",

It\u2019s a strange curve- you don\u2019t see firsthand the damage your doing to your teeth and gut so you keep with your purging ways... til you\u2019ve fucked them over and then it can be a steep acceleration downhill from there if you aren\u2019t harm minimising.\n\n**Other things tend to linger for years though you can work to fix it**. \n\n- Psychologically, my relationship with food, self-image and self-worth is fucked, as per any ED. \n\n- My social life has been affected so much, esp the friendships I had or could have had. I harbour a lot of guilt and feel like a fraud. \n\n- A minor but debilitating example: I would be eating so little when I was having lunch with friends at uni (in order to compensate for my secret b/p)\u2014> ironically I was actually gaining weight from b/p \u2014> paranoia they would talk behind my back, fear of meeting old friends I hadn\u2019t seen in years \u2014> becoming more shut-in and doing more b/p\u2019s....)\n\n- My relationship with parents is shite esp since they\u2019ve found out about purging. I have no independence from them and no privacy because they worry for me. \n\n- I can\u2019t go back in time and fix my grades.\n\nAll in all, I can\u2019t fix what\u2019s happened in the past. I\u2019m working to minimise purging and other ED behaviours now. I\u2019m trying to forgive myself, learn my lessons and move forwards.

I'm still finding out so much is wrong and destroyed with my body because of my ED, but specifically from purging. And it's still a struggle to control the urge knowing that. \nAll the love and support on your journey \u2764\ufe0f you can fight this. ",

Nothing is fool-proof and the temptation is still very much there. But vanity played a fair part as well. I've always hated my face and getting rid of chipmunk cheeks was a huge goal. ",
