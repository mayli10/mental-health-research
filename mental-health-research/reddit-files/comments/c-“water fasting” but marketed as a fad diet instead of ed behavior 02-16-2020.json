A lot of religions talk about discipline and will do forms of fasting from either food or food and water. They aren\u2019t generally for days at a time like what we think of for fasting, it\u2019s closer to IF where you have specific times you can eat. Most focus on food but some people will cut off all intake during those hours. Not sure if any religion directly says \u2018no water\u2019 (I think Islam might during Ramadan, correct me if I\u2019m wrong though) but some people or subgroups will interpret it as such. \n\nEx: I had a family friend whose family would celebrate Ramadan and they didn\u2019t drink water during the day. \n\nThere really is no reason to not drink water if your goal is weight loss (unless you\u2019re trying to get into a weight bracket as a wrestler or something) since it helps aide in your bodily functions.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time.

A lot of religions talk about discipline and will do forms of fasting from either food or food and water. They aren\u2019t generally for days at a time like what we think of for fasting, it\u2019s closer to IF where you have specific times you can eat. Most focus on food but some people will cut off all intake during those hours. Not sure if any religion directly says \u2018no water\u2019 (I think Islam might during Ramadan, correct me if I\u2019m wrong though) but some people or subgroups will interpret it as such. \n\nEx: I had a family friend whose family would celebrate Ramadan and they didn\u2019t drink water during the day. \n\nThere really is no reason to not drink water if your goal is weight loss (unless you\u2019re trying to get into a weight bracket as a wrestler or something) since it helps aide in your bodily functions.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time.

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns.

                        "Text": "Not my religion. But I know some people abstain from food and water for some religious reasons. A lot of religions talk about discipline and will do forms of fasting from either food or food and water. They aren\u2019t generally for days at a time like what we think of for fasting, it\u2019s closer to IF where you have specific times you can eat. Most focus on food but some people will cut off all intake during those hours. Not sure if any religion directly says \u2018no water\u2019 (I think Islam might during Ramadan, correct me if I\u2019m wrong though) but some people or subgroups will interpret it as such. \n\nEx: I had a family friend whose family would celebrate Ramadan and they didn\u2019t drink water during the day. \n\nThere really is no reason to not drink water if your goal is weight loss (unless you\u2019re trying to get into a weight bracket as a wrestler or something) since it helps aide in your bodily functions.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns.

A lot of religions talk about discipline and will do forms of fasting from either food or food and water. They aren\u2019t generally for days at a time like what we think of for fasting, it\u2019s closer to IF where you have specific times you can eat. Most focus on food but some people will cut off all intake during those hours. Not sure if any religion directly says \u2018no water\u2019 (I think Islam might during Ramadan, correct me if I\u2019m wrong though) but some people or subgroups will interpret it as such. \n\nEx: I had a family friend whose family would celebrate Ramadan and they didn\u2019t drink water during the day. \n\nThere really is no reason to not drink water if your goal is weight loss (unless you\u2019re trying to get into a weight bracket as a wrestler or something) since it helps aide in your bodily functions.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns.

A lot of religions talk about discipline and will do forms of fasting from either food or food and water.

Most focus on food but some people will cut off all intake during those hours. Not sure if any religion directly says \u2018no water\u2019 (I think Islam might during Ramadan, correct me if I\u2019m wrong though) but some people or subgroups will interpret it as such. \n\nEx: I had a family friend whose family would celebrate Ramadan and they didn\u2019t drink water during the day. \n\nThere really is no reason to not drink water if your goal is weight loss (unless you\u2019re trying to get into a weight bracket as a wrestler or something) since it helps aide in your bodily functions.",

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time.

I have some really interesting notes and papers about this if you would like me to share them with you. In addition, the body can adapt to some things and not others. The problem is the composition of Western diets moreso than calories alone. An imbalance of fatty acids such as saturated fat, lack of fiber,  overabbundance of corn and wheat, and lack of plants in the diet are some of my primary concerns. When researchers have followed true Paleolithic diets in the past, people were literally shutting 6 pounds at a time. Our societies and bodies are not the same as hunter gatherers from centuries ago, and that is certain.",

From what I know, different studies that look at fasting or intermittent fasting are limited due to ethical research guidelines or varying definitions of how long a fast should last/how many calories are permissible.
