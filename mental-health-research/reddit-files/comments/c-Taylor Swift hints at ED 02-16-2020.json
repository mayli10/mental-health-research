But I just keep coming back because a) I live for her music, and b) she's so smart and so, so real. It's amazing how she's been able to maintain humility and a growth mindset even at her level of fame. I relate so much to a lot of these, not just the one about body acceptance. The last one was a punch in the gut because I was the exact same as a child and I think that mindset is what's caused a lot of my eating/self-image issues.\n\nSidenote it's so fucked up how one of her fans who got a meet and greet complimented her on getting \"thick\" without knowing how she felt about her weight gain.
