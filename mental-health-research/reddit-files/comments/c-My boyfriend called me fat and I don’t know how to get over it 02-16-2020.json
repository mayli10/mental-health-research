You are absolutely right to feel so hurt. He said something hurtful.  We are just internet strangers, it\u2019s difficult for us to fully assess your relationship, only you can do that. \n\nIf this was my relationship (which is pretty solid after a few years) I\u2019d be having a discussion to ask him his understanding of this disease. That it\u2019s of the mind, not just the food, and how his words played into that as well as were just hurtful body shaming comments that I don\u2019t agree with.  If he loves me and supports me then that includes my mind when it is sick and my body when it changes. \n\nIf you can\u2019t even have that conversation or something like it, it sounds like you are walking on eggshells.

                "Text": ">he also said that \u201cbulimia is not the worst thing to deal with\u201d. \n\nHUH????????\n\nHe NEEDS to be GONE. These two comments together are EXTREMELY worrying for me. Was this something he'd said already at some other time, or did he say this in response to you trying to talk to him just now!? Either way, having a boyfriend who tells you that any eating disorder isn't really a big deal (which is already bad) and THEN goes on to make disparaging comments about how your body looks is a BIG! RED! FLAG!\n\nSpeaking of red flags, this:\n\n>promise \\[you\\] won\u2019t take it personally \n\n... is like Manipulation 101. I'm not saying your boyfriend is definitely manipulating you, or abusive, but this train of \"logic\" - telling you something upsetting, but also making you promise you won't get upset, so that they can basically insult you without repercussions and chip away at your self-esteem or make you look irrational/unfair if you DO get upset by the upsetting thing they said - is certainly a tactic used by many abusive partners. It's often them \"testing the waters\", so to speak. If you let them get away with brazenly insulting you and undermining you to your face simply because they told you that you had to, then they'll know they can get away with more in the future. Soon, they won't even make you promise not to get upset before they insult you, they'll just insult you, because they already know you won't get upset.\n\nAgain. Not saying your bf is 100% for-sure trying intentionally to manipulate you this way because that gets thrown around a lot on this website. But it is a red flag and you shouldn't have to put up with someone who makes you feel like this.\n\nAlso I bet you look amazing in crop tops, just saying.",
