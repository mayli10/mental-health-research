My family is pretty on board with it because I genuinely do seem to have more energy when I do it, and they see me eating healthy. But like when I'm at work explaining why I can't eat the donuts so and so brought in I get weird looks. Or when I get invited to a happy hour and decline because it's outside my window. People look at me weird. Intermittent fasting makes me feel really good and I don't do any of my ED behaviors when I'm doing it consistently so hopefully I can sustain it.\n\nI think I miiiiight be able to do it long term, but idk if I can eat maintenance in one sitting without like adding a bunch of oil to things.

My family is pretty on board with it because I genuinely do seem to have more energy when I do it, and they see me eating healthy. But like when I'm at work explaining why I can't eat the donuts so and so brought in I get weird looks. Or when I get invited to a happy hour and decline because it's outside my window. People look at me weird. Intermittent fasting makes me feel really good and I don't do any of my ED behaviors when I'm doing it consistently so hopefully I can sustain it.\n\nI think I miiiiight be able to do it long term, but idk if I can eat maintenance in one sitting without like adding a bunch of oil to things. I'm vegan so my meals tend to be a bit bulkier because the food is lower-cal without meat.",
