It is a big global issue, the \"diet culture\" the excessive amount of stress in college and being short on money to eat properly is making us have absolute shit diet and relationship with food. Today's society has put in our minds that it is more important to look good than to be healthy, both mentally and physically and it is fucked up. On the other side companies are pushing shit products high on calories, pack with sugar and fat and no nutrition for cheap, being as addictive as science has shown them to be, people struggle. Sadly a capitalistic society where money is so preach as success and has so much power, human life is worthless to them who have it.",

They would constantly talk about how they were trying to lose weight, or how they\u2019d skipped dinner the night before, most days they\u2019d skip lunch. I remember that that used to trigger me so fucking much and tbh I think it may\u2019ve contirbuted to me developing an ED back then.",

Normal people can do these disordered things and not need therapy because they won't continue to do it until they kill themselves. Doing something \"unhealthy\" a few times is different to doing it compulsively. Normal people aren't trapped or controlled by their eating habits, they utilise them to suit their needs and it doesn't go further than that. So what if some people only eat when they're high? So what if some people eat one meal a day? \n\nOther people not being the textbook picture of health doesn't make you any less ill. ",
