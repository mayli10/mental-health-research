It's also okay if you don't really know how to make food choices that work yet. You haven't eaten properly in a while and you have to learn how to do that. Recovery is a process! A marathon, not a sprint. Forgive yourself for not getting it right all at once. Also throw your scale out. You don't need to know what you weigh. Like, ever really! I have not weighed myself in nearly two years and I have only been asked twice what my weight is in that time - once when I was in hospital and once when we were going trail riding and in both cases I did not need to know. The hospital could check it for me without me knowing and the horse riding place just needed to know I wasn't too big to get on a horse, which I am not. \n\nUse your support systems! My husband has been *amazing*. I literally could not have done any of this without him reminding me its okay and telling me how much he loves me still. The man is a saint,  what can I say. It doesn't have to be a romantic partner but have someone you can be like \"hey,  this is hard and I need help\" to is really good and important. You know what they say - if you want to go quickly,  go alone, but if you want to go far,  go together. \n\nI have been an anorexic for most of my life (I'm nearly 30) and like alcoholics are never fully recovered I think I will always be a recovering anorexic. But in the immortal words of that weird monkey from bojack horseman, it gets easier every day but you have to do it every day. \n\nThis got long sorry. I hope it helps!",

Especially those who are short or petite! \n\nAll my healthy weight/recovered clothes were XS AUS and that's okay! I also have healthy adult friends who are like, 5 foot tall, or very slim, and wearing smaller clothes doesn't make them any less of a grown ass woman!\n\n(I know you didn't intend it maliciously in any way and I'm really happy for you, just kind of pointing it out because this idea of slim/small women not being 'real women' is something that's coming up a lot in the backlash of 'we don't all need to be tiny'.
