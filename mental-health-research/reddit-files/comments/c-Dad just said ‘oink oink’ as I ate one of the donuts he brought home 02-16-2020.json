I try to be more tolerant these days (not that I get far with that), but if he's got a raw nerve over anything, make him feel shitty about it.  I should totally never be a family relationship counsellor lol.\n\nHope the donut was good though.  I want some of the ones that're made fresh.  Stuff like Dunkin Donuts don't hit the spot.

Granted he died when I was 28, so that\u2019s part of it. \n\nEither way. It sucks how bad some comments just can\u2019t be unheard or unsaid and always linger.",
