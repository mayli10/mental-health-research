Lol does anyone else feel so incredibly sly when they're about to binge and then so dumb before/during/after they purge?\n\nBut as to #11 *fluoxetine* (prozac) is the only antidepressant approved by FDA specifically for treating bulimia and for me it made a world of difference. Like, from purging up to 5 times a day to now maybe having a small lapse or two per week. It may be the placebo effect because I really wanted to feel better and for it to work, but in general 10/10 worth it to see a psychiatrist and see if they recommend any meds for you imo",
