I gotta stop letting my insecurities about my body hold me back because they\u2019ll always be there. he likes me. I need to get the fuck over myself and start being a normal person outside of my eating habits at least lsylgsstsltsls\n\nI\u2019m at my hw though. Barely an 18.6 BMI so I know it\u2019s not horrible and I shouldn\u2019t complain but I\u2019ve never... been this big. my jean shorts from last spring are too tight. I was getting dressed today and started crying. I hate being tall cause I feel like a man even at a barely healthy weight\n\nsorry for the paragraphs lol",
