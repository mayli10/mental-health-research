                    "Text": "I could give you a different platitude? \n\nIdk if this will help, but if you are feeling like weight=worth, you can try asking \"to whom?\" If the answer is yourself, that's fixable. If the answer is society, that's not fixable. Either way, you can adjust your perspective and tell society to fuck itself because at the end of the day, we are a bunch of self-obsessed monkeys in shoes killing time while we  wait for the sweet embrace of death. I know, reframing your perspective is tough, I haven't done it yet myself, but that's the long and short of it. \n\nIf you are hurting yourself with your behaviors, then yes, you are mentally ill at least in some capacity and it's worth getting to the root of that. No offense, but it's why we are all on this sub. \n\nI hope some of that helped ...I'm not good at this kind of thing, but I think reconciling that nothing matters including my own need to matter got me to at least a slightly better place than I was and I am just hoping that might help you too.

She didn't do much for me because I was seeing her for ptsd but she also didn't laugh me out of her office. She really made it clear that the generally accepted stance among her field is that anyone can have an eating disorder, your weight will only determine your diagnosis. That was really validating for me and reminded me that if I'm in pain now, I'm \"sick enough\" to get help. If you're really suffering and want to talk to someone, don't let your own perception of yourself stand in your way because you're worth more than that.",
