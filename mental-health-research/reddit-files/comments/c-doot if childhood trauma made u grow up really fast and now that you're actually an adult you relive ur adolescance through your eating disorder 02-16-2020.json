                            "Text": "Trauma doesn\u2019t necessarily mean someone doing something malicious to you. It just means an earthshaking event. What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either.

It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",

                            "Text": "Trauma doesn\u2019t necessarily mean someone doing something malicious to you. It just means an earthshaking event. What that is depends on the person experiencing it to some extent. But the death of a parent is a trauma alone, and the subsequent problem of neglect from the surviving parent is another. If it wasn\u2019t traumatic it wouldn\u2019t have hurt you and negatively affected your life for however long it did. And you should never feel bad that you\u2019re sad about the negative things that happened in your life because someone else had it worse. We only have our own reality, and yours is as meaningful and important as anyone else\u2019s. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but mourning the bad in your own life isn\u2019t a slap in the face to people who had it worse. Your can feel for yourself as well as for others. It doesn\u2019t make other\u2019s pain greater to have had your own. If you wouldn\u2019t tell someone else to get over their pain because others have more them you shouldn\u2019t say it to yourself either. Just because you have less to heal from doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth doing. You deserve to be whole just as much as the next person. And I\u2019m glad your relationship with your mother has improved. I\u2019ll get off my self love soapbox now, but remember this and you be kind to you.",
