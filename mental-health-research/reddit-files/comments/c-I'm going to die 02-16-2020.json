That\u2019s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you\u2019re fighting a different kind of darkness. \n\nThe thing I realized about my darkness is that once I got help for my ED and severe depression for the first time, it changed everything. All of a sudden, things weren\u2019t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I\u2019d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn\u2019t the only thing I knew how to feel. \n\nI relapse all the time, and sometimes I\u2019m a huge mess, but now I know it\u2019s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal. \n\nI felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I\u2019m still here, and I can honestly say that I\u2019m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you ate an apple. It sounds like your mom is diminishing your struggle. Can you get to an ER on your own? Is there anyone else you can call?",

It's possible that she's frustrated because she wants you to be better and she feels powerless to help. It's common for families and loved ones to react with anger because they hate that you're suffering but they can't do anything to fix it. I don't how your relationship with your mother, but I think it's likely that she's angry because she loves you.",

That\u2019s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you\u2019re fighting a different kind of darkness. \n\nThe thing I realized about my darkness is that once I got help for my ED and severe depression for the first time, it changed everything. All of a sudden, things weren\u2019t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I\u2019d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn\u2019t the only thing I knew how to feel. \n\nI relapse all the time, and sometimes I\u2019m a huge mess, but now I know it\u2019s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal. \n\nI felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I\u2019m still here, and I can honestly say that I\u2019m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you ate an apple. It sounds like your mom is diminishing your struggle. Can you get to an ER on your own? Is there anyone else you can call?",

That\u2019s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you\u2019re fighting a different kind of darkness. \n\nThe thing I realized about my darkness is that once I got help for my ED and severe depression for the first time, it changed everything. All of a sudden, things weren\u2019t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I\u2019d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn\u2019t the only thing I knew how to feel. \n\nI relapse all the time, and sometimes I\u2019m a huge mess, but now I know it\u2019s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal. \n\nI felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I\u2019m still here, and I can honestly say that I\u2019m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you ate an apple.

It's possible that she's frustrated because she wants you to be better and she feels powerless to help.

I don't how your relationship with your mother, but I think it's likely that she's angry because she loves you.",

That\u2019s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you\u2019re fighting a different kind of darkness. \n\nThe thing I realized about my darkness is that once I got help for my ED and severe depression for the first time, it changed everything. All of a sudden, things weren\u2019t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I\u2019d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn\u2019t the only thing I knew how to feel. \n\nI relapse all the time, and sometimes I\u2019m a huge mess, but now I know it\u2019s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal. \n\nI felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I\u2019m still here, and I can honestly say that I\u2019m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you ate an apple. It sounds like your mom is diminishing your struggle. Can you get to an ER on your own? Is there anyone else you can call?",

That\u2019s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you\u2019re fighting a different kind of darkness. \n\nThe thing I realized about my darkness is that once I got help for my ED and severe depression for the first time, it changed everything. All of a sudden, things weren\u2019t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I\u2019d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn\u2019t the only thing I knew how to feel. \n\nI relapse all the time, and sometimes I\u2019m a huge mess, but now I know it\u2019s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal. \n\nI felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I\u2019m still here, and I can honestly say that I\u2019m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you ate an apple.

It's possible that she's frustrated because she wants you to be better and she feels powerless to help. It's common for families and loved ones to react with anger because they hate that you're suffering but they can't do anything to fix it. I don't how your relationship with your mother, but I think it's likely that she's angry because she loves you.",

That\u2019s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you\u2019re fighting a different kind of darkness. \n\nThe thing I realized about my darkness is that once I got help for my ED and severe depression for the first time, it changed everything. All of a sudden, things weren\u2019t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I\u2019d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn\u2019t the only thing I knew how to feel. \n\nI relapse all the time, and sometimes I\u2019m a huge mess, but now I know it\u2019s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal. \n\nI felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I\u2019m still here, and I can honestly say that I\u2019m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you ate an apple. It sounds like your mom is diminishing your struggle. Can you get to an ER on your own? Is there anyone else you can call?",

That\u2019s my reason for having a list, but I can tell in your post that you\u2019re fighting a different kind of darkness. \n\nThe thing I realized about my darkness is that once I got help for my ED and severe depression for the first time, it changed everything. All of a sudden, things weren\u2019t pitch black; they were just... dark, because I\u2019d seen a glimpse of life on the other side. I had context all of a sudden, and this sadness wasn\u2019t the only thing I knew how to feel. \n\nI relapse all the time, and sometimes I\u2019m a huge mess, but now I know it\u2019s not permanent. I know I can have moments and those moments can string together and become entire days of feeling normal. \n\nI felt like a huge idiot for getting help, honestly. Like a fraud who brought all her problems upon herself. But today I\u2019m still here, and I can honestly say that I\u2019m glad, even though a huge part of me always wishes my ED would just be the end of me. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you ate an apple.

It's possible that she's frustrated because she wants you to be better and she feels powerless to help. It's common for families and loved ones to react with anger because they hate that you're suffering but they can't do anything to fix it. I don't how your relationship with your mother, but I think it's likely that she's angry because she loves you.",
