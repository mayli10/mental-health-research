(AFRID) and I'm very aware that if I just stopped being distracted I could get more work done (ADHD). It's the mental aspect that sucks, if I was paralysed from the waist down no one would tell me to just get up and walk, it's so easy! Because it's obvious to see there's something wrong but mental issues are practically invisible.\n\nSorry I can relate to your last line quite hard :(",
