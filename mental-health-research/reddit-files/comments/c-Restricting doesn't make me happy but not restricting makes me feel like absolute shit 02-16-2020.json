The people in my life have irregular schedules and eat at irregular times. My relationships are fragmented, so is my self-concept. I keep feeling this \"who gives a shit\" narrative running through the whole thing. \n\nI've got to give myself reasons to do it. Appetite and reactive eating leave you without a choice. You have to adapt to the backlash and accept it otherwise it's more disastrous imo (chasing your losses). It's hard for me to find a middle ground. I have PTSD, lots of OP which is very triggering and ongoing and it feeds into everything else",
