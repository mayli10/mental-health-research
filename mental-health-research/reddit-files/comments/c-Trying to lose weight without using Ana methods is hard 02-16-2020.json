                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

                        "Text": "Prozac (also Lexapro) fucked me up too. I ended up b/ping more frequently but was still losing weight because of the purging. Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

                        "Text": "Prozac (also Lexapro) fucked me up too. I ended up b/ping more frequently but was still losing weight because of the purging. Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

So far based on my experience I wouldn't recommend it to hardly anyone. It's a very inflexible diet. It can be enjoyable honestly (especially being able to eat super fatty foods that were previously off-limits) and it does have a lot of benefits, but most of the benefits are in the therapeutic realm (treatment of mental disease, eg epilepsy, also treatment of cancers) and like I said there does seem to be some kind of advantage to the diet for obese people trying to lose weight but for normal metabolically healthy people on a mixed diet, unless you're an elite athlete I wouldn't recommend it.

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

                        "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet.

So far based on my experience I wouldn't recommend it to hardly anyone. It's a very inflexible diet. It can be enjoyable honestly (especially being able to eat super fatty foods that were previously off-limits) and it does have a lot of benefits, but most of the benefits are in the therapeutic realm (treatment of mental disease, eg epilepsy, also treatment of cancers) and like I said there does seem to be some kind of advantage to the diet for obese people trying to lose weight but for normal metabolically healthy people on a mixed diet, unless you're an elite athlete I wouldn't recommend it. I'm only planning on doing it short-term, like another month or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor typical anorexia, yes, I believe weight gain is a prerequisite to recovery.",

                        "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

You start to view your identity and life in general outside of the context of your shape, size, weight, and food in general. I had to I internalize that God loved me the same when I was at both my highest and my lowest weight. It's a process, and a tough one. But it's worth it.",

I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

                        "Text": "Prozac (also Lexapro) fucked me up too. I ended up b/ping more frequently but was still losing weight because of the purging. Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

                    "Text": "At least when I went to get help, they put me on anti depressants so I could eat and saw a nutritionist. Usually every 2 to 3 weeks. Well since at this point my Prozac was leading me to binging, they just put me on Wellbutrin (for binging). Honestly getting into recovery was the WORST decision of my life. Wellbutrin made me not eat for days, but whenever i missed a dose I would fall back into my regular habits of binging. It was terrible. I wanted to cry and I became over weight. I stopped taking medication all together, stop seeing that dumb psych and the nutritionist. I pay out of pocket for a therapist currently who\u2019s helped me try to go the \u201chealthy\u201d route and it all worked for a couple of months until I relapsed back into to depression. \n\nOh all of this happened when I was 19. I\u2019m 21 now. So two years of damage to my body. \n\nAlso this was through my university\u2019s health clinic, like you\u2019d think they\u2019ve handled more young adults with ED\u2019s to not let them cycle this way. \n\nTLDR: Once you have an ED, you really can\u2019t help yourself unless you get professional help. It\u2019s a long process with food. ",

                            "Text": "Prozac (also Lexapro) fucked me up too. I ended up b/ping more frequently but was still losing weight because of the purging. Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

What you need to do to recover from an eating disorder is re-learn how to eat intuitively and eat freely (whatever you want) yet mindfully. For me it involved the extreme hunger and eating tons of calories to restore my weight. Very unpleasant but I'm sure even on a keto diet the situation would have played out exactly the same, minus delaying restoration of my mental sanity because restricting this many foods is tough psychologically to maintain at times.",

It's an essential part of how the body recovers. If I stop working out, on about the 4th day my muscles will fully heal and I'll drop a few pounds on the scale (my physique will also look a little flatter). Soon as I do a couple solid workouts it shoots right back up.",

                            "Text": "I think I can answer this for some people. I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpeaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry. This is also around when I started intermittent fasting, packing in the veggies, all the typical stuff you see around here. Before that, all I did was cut my portions down and continued eating whatever I wanted.",

Still useless because I had to drop out of college since I was doing it like 4 times a day and then not sleeping. It made me absolutely manic, I thought I was going insane. My family and therapist went off on me for stopping cold turkey but I get scared thinking about what would have happened if I had continued.\n\nAs a ps, I got my script through my university too. He was an old guy, asked me super vague questions over a fifteen minute period, and they all had absolutely no idea what to do with me. I feel like they just took a shot in the dark and hoped it would work out. I originally thought it would be more common/well handled in that environment so I trusted them. Big mistake lol\n\nEdit: my therapist was wonderful and changed my life, but I wish she would have listened to me when I was desperate and knew the meds weren\u2019t right. The one that was throwing medication at me had a thick skull, and I should have probably done more research but was desperate. If you need someone to talk to, the talk-type sessions are always useful. Just be careful when they start talking meds and maybe get evaluated to make sure you aren\u2019t the perfect storm for shitty side effects",

I did snap out of it recently and started adding more calories and feel heaps better. I will say this diet is amazing for your hormonal health. Even at relatively low body fat you can feel pretty normal, have normal libido, normal body temperature, good skin/hair health, long as you're taking in enough calories. That's been the surprising part. Other than that, there's no magic. Restricting on keto feels exactly the same as restricting on a high carb diet - you're just insanely hungry all the time and your energy levels are horrible. Personally, my hunger signaling didn't change one iota. I still get hungry every few hours and I feel about as hungry as I did on my normal diet. I'm hoping once I gain back some weight this will change.",

                            "Text": "I've had to make several adaptations to survive, because I've never operated within a dietary system that specifically restricted the types and ratios of foods I eat. When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my \"safe foods\" and \"fear foods\" ...you know the drill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with \"fat bombs\" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of \"keto ramen\" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping \"ketorade\" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my \"sweet tooth\" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a \"salt tooth\" if there is such a thing.",

Like with diets it\u2019s kind of hard to eat freely bc like in a way you\u2019re too mindful about what is going into your system, like with calorie counting. It\u2019s ridiculous how many fear foods I have. Like I honestly think there\u2019s only 2 food categories I currently classify as safe. I am currently seeking help, however I don\u2019t know if I see myself recovering and I think maybe I could just manage this because a lot of individuals I\u2019ve spoken to about this have relapsed which is a bit discouraging but I know how difficult it is to break / beat this as unfortunate as that may be for all us who have developed the Ed mentality ",

The highs get higher, the lows don't get as low. You physically heal and you start to trust yourself more. You start to view your identity and life in general outside of the context of your shape, size, weight, and food in general. I had to I internalize that God loved me the same when I was at both my highest and my lowest weight. It's a process, and a tough one. But it's worth it.",
