Drank some water, ate one boiled egg, took a massive BM, then got back on the scale for fun. Up 3.5 lbs. That's, like, breaking the laws of physics! My scale is new and not cheap...\n\nI also feel better when I've been able to fast long enough to not feel hungry. But I broke it with that one stupid egg, and been ravenous all day (and gave in, mostly).",
