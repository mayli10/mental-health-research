I don't think it was up for very long before the post was removed, because there were only 15-20 comments, but most of them to the tune of, \"she looks perfectly healthy/normal!\"  I was really glad it got removed.  They have a new rule in place for no pictures of fat bodies.  Wish they just implement the rule for all bodies.  The \"guess the BMI\" posts are just frustrating.   One of the comments said, \"if she was underweight her elbows would be much wider than her upper arms,\"  as if that's a fucking requirement of being underweight.  Ya'll are right, they truly believe \"underweight\" is someone they wouldn't be attracted to.",
