For what reason? Do you find pleasure in it? Does it energize you? Does it put your life into a more positive perspective? There's no reason to be cruel. You can believe the things you want to believe without actively trying to hurt the feelings of others. I'm sure you are not a mean, bad person in real life.

For what reason? Do you find pleasure in it? Does it energize you? Does it put your life into a more positive perspective? There's no reason to be cruel. You can believe the things you want to believe without actively trying to hurt the feelings of others. I'm sure you are not a mean, bad person in real life. I'm sorry you've had negative experiences with women. But this is not the best place to talk about them. I am rooting for you and hope you are able to carry less anger in the future. \n\n&#x200B;",

Well... it's sort of disheartening that you would spend time coming onto the sub and being mean to women who may be *wary of men.* \n\nYou are going to get the same responses here saying that MGTOW is a normal, well-adjusted group as you would going into that sub and saying that women are just as good as men, lol.\n\n You are literally calling women in this thread \"faggots\" and \"thots\". For what reason? Do you find pleasure in it? Does it energize you? Does it put your life into a more positive perspective? There's no reason to be cruel. You can believe the things you want to believe without actively trying to hurt the feelings of others. I'm sure you are not a mean, bad person in real life. I'm sorry you've had negative experiences with women. But this is not the best place to talk about them. I am rooting for you and hope you are able to carry less anger in the future. \n\n&#x200B;",

For what reason? Do you find pleasure in it? Does it energize you? Does it put your life into a more positive perspective? There's no reason to be cruel. You can believe the things you want to believe without actively trying to hurt the feelings of others. I'm sure you are not a mean, bad person in real life.
