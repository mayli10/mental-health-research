Concerts or clubs or local events? Nope\n\nI almost dread trips or even going camping and hiking where I'm literally almost alone in the woods because I don't deserve fun? I guess \n\nThe awful thing is that I LOVE all those things. I'm not a big partyer at all but I used to enjoy going out with friends a few times a year. I love food and breweries and music and blah blah \n\nBut I think it's just that my disorder for the most part is centred around depression and self harm so. Ya know. Fuck me",

It hurts so much to think I may be hurting him but when I feel \u201ctoo big\u201d I cringe away from him when he tries to hug me or touch me and I just say I\u2019m feeling ill again. Last night he asked me \u201cI can\u2019t even hug you?\u201d And he sounded so hurt and confused it broke my heart. Typing this out is actually the first time I\u2019ve articulated it to even myself and I realize how fucked up I really am.  Now I\u2019m crying lol",

I dont have many status-y things like a husband, home I own (I live in a studio), kids, or a career I can brag about. If I were some high powered business executive I could say my career is a reason why I dont have a family. I love my career but it's not that fancy and i dont make tons of money. \n\nPart of me feels that what's holding me back from a lot is my weight I dont deserve those things anyway while I'm this big. And I worry everyone around me is like \"of course shes unsuccessful, have you seen her?\" \n\nI'm an open and supportive friend. I can be fun to be around. I support myself financially. Yet I dont see the progress I've made in my life bc it's not a status thing. No one sees it. I dont have anything to brag about but I also feel like I don't deserve those things anyway. But if I was thin, I could show myself off. People would assume I'm doing well. When they find out I'm single theyd say \"but you're so pretty!\" And not \"I know you want to date but men are very visual. \" I don't deserve to date some amazing guy when I'm so sub par.",
