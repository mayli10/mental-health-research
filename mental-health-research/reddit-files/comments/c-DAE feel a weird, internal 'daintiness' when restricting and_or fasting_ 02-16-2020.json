I think the physical emptiness coupled with the massive feeling of control just has a ton of strange effects on the body/mind. I've never actually wrote or said this and it's crazy to see I'm not alone with that weird feeling",

I tried taking it home cause I should probably have food for the next 2 days but then it spilt a little bit so I just threw it away and felt even better. \n\nIt doesn't really make sense at all to spend like your last 10 dollars on food to not eat it yet it makes perfect sense. Then I feel bad occasionally when I go up to 1500+  and feel like I am just a fat person who only eats salad in front of other people and then eats an extra large pizza for dinner. And that they are just looking at me like you don't even eat food yet how are you so big. I'm not even big. I'm probably at 19 bmi or something (don't have a scale but I take my measurements) but I won't feel perfect until it's 18-18.5, there is no extra chub and I can fit into my smallest size 0 clothes easily.
