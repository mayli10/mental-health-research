Not feeling nauseous every time I bend over is definitely a cool new feature!",

Caffeine abuse can really fuck you up, BUT it's contained to the bloodstream which already has some regulatory bodies (liver, kidneys) to filter it out. The issue with lax is that you are purging out GOOD bacteria that keep your gut healthy, which can lead to an overabundance of dangerous damaging bacteria that may never recover. Caffeine triggered \"Gotta fucking go NOW\" is still not great, but laxatives work by actually fucking with the water balance in your GI tract which is bad news bears\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I'm sorry you're still feeling the urge to do a dangerous behavior, but I am glad that you aren't crossing the line into behavior that can cause catastrophic nearly impossible to reverse damage",
