Like, when they learned I was below *200* they got pissed off??? They thought I was gonna die because I had just barely dipped below Obese???\n\nI genuinely think them thinking I'd gained was a combination of them being idiots who don't know what weight looks like (my sister has a BMI of about 16, hasn't had her period in almost a year, and almost had full renal failure recently, and they think she's totally healthy) and me wearing a heavy coat earlier cause it was snowing (but I'd taken it off in the Chipotle so idk???)",

Binge sometimes on snacks at work that are free and then go home. I don\u2019t keep food at home. Ever. \n\nI buy bags of cubes ice and chew on it until I fall asleep.

I've also been in your co-workers situation, but, like, opposite--I had a fat friend ask me how much I think she weights (oh boy), and I thought I was being conservative by guessing 180.

Before I developed an ED I thought 110 was the weight that skinny girls were. Don't take it personally, what's more important is what's actually true and that's what's on the scale. Don't worry booboo, don't let people's comments whether they're good or bad effect your body image. You are your own person who is in control of your body and if you're 98 lbs than that's what you are. No need to worry about people thinking you look a bit \"over\", most people without eating disorders don't realize the OCD people with ED's have over numbers and such. I'm sure you look like a skinny legend <3",
