It is important to remember men may not feel validated and because of this often not get the help they need (and it\u2019s hard to develop statistics because of this). Men can also feel pressured to look a different way. We should advocate for treatment for everyone that needs it :-)",

But in relation to that, dismantling the patriarchy requires you to be accepting of men who haven\u2019t hurt you or anyone and allow them a safe space to speak about their disorder too. It also requires us as women to accept the ways in which we\u2019ve been toxic. Case in point, I think it\u2019s wrong to say men aren\u2019t under scrutiny, because they are. Not entirely the same, but they face struggles in relation to their own gender and society\u2019s view of bodies. I\u2019ve seen countless men called scrawny or chicken legged. Countless men who aren\u2019t super fit are called out for their dad bods. It\u2019s no different than someone calling you curvy or thicc, even if it\u2019s positive to another person- both genders face body critiques. \n\n   There\u2019s a way to voice your frustrations about *people* without invalidating or shaming a gender as a whole. It would be inappropriate for a man to say \u201cwomen are trash\u201d, so why would it be acceptable for you to do so? If you want a sub for women only, start one. ",

Men\u2019s mental health is also a topic that women are getting on board to support because we realize that encouraging men to be emotional and lovable beings is one of the next steps in dismantaling the patriarchy.
