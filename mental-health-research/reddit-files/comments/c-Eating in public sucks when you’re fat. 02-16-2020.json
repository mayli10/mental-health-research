                "Text": "I've honestly never noticed this and my weight has ranged from normal to nearly morbidly obese. Maybe I was just oblivious? Or you guys live in areas with ruder people? Or it's worse depending on where you are eating?\n\nI only really felt judged once, and it was by the people I was with. I was the fattest one in the group and the only one that finished their food. None of them said anything, so it could have been my own insecurities.\n\nIt does seem that at healthy weight people will comment if you eat a lot of food. Like they are amazed by your appetite, \"you must have been hungry!\"  or \"where do you put it?\"",

You take comfort in toxic culture. But then you overhear your new coworkers talk about your weight. Confused about how you're still overweight despite the fact that no one sees you eat anything other than coffee and chewing gum. \ud83d\ude43\n\nPraying for a meteor to land on my head!",

It\u2019s a thing. \n\nI for one...used to look in peoples grocery carts. If they were thin I looked at what they were buying and if they were heavy I would judge them in my head if they had lots of junk food. It\u2019s totally wrong and I stopped doing it once I got older and realized how fucked up it was to judge people by what they ate. \n\nI, myself have an unhealthy relationship with food so I\u2019m sure I was projecting. \n\nI now make a point of letting people close to me know that they are fat shaming and should focus on themselves...\n\nIncidentally, it\u2019s always the people that have struggled with weight themselves that are the worst in my experiences.",

                "Text": "Honestly, for me, eating in public is hard period when you have any sort of messed up relationship with body image/food. When I was anorexic, I felt like people were watching to see if I ate and trying to put food in my face, etc. Now, I've fallen into some sort of accidental \"recovery\" aka, I binged hard for 2 weeks and gained like 15 lbs, and I feel like people are judging me for eating because I feel fatter. Personally, I've never given a shit about someone eating and if anything I enjoy seeing people enjoy their food. When I see skinny girls eat, especially burgers or pizza, I always wonder if they throw it up later or if they just work out a lot or won the genetic lottery. It's pretty obvious that over weight people like food so I don't see why it would be a shock to see someone fat eat in public. No one should ever feel ashamed to eat, though. I think it's ridiculous but of course... we just wanna be skinny legends :/",

Last weekend I went to a restaurant by myself for the first time ever and it was mortifying. I felt like everyone in there was staring at me, I hadn't eaten at all that day, woke up early and it was almost 8pm so I got a meal and a dessert. I felt HORRIBLE the whole time. \n\nPersonally though. I tend to either binge, restrict or starve and cycle through those quite often. Being legitimately fat also makes people think \"they can't have an ED, they're HUGE!\" Well, we can and do, sadly.",

I don't think it's a good idea to antagonise people about their weight/eating habits\n\nI had issues with strangers from their erroneous perceptions of themselves and each other, and from the rise of ED's in the public\n\nI thought strangers looked at me in 2013 and conspired it would be a lot of fun to shrink me to x kg. I think I'd freak out and eat more out of self-defence\n\nWhen I needed help- I was weak from my ED and malnourished a few years later, and couldn't push it any further- I had people looking at me who thought I was \"perfectly healthy\" and I could stand to lose some weight, and that I was \"fine\" \"great\" etc-\n\nIt's not a recovery-friendly society :/ you can't get license to binge/re-feed/gain anywhere- they don't support it imo?\n\nEven if/when you do get it- by then you're so confused and deluded by your ED latching onto every negative example/anecdote from a deluded public, you'd have to completely re-train your brain\n\nYou'll have internalised too much brainwashing and your insecurities/fears are manifold.. it doesn't matter if there is any proof anymore\n\nSo many people read into strangers and create problems with them, think they're out to get each other etc. They're not schizophrenic. They make me feel like I wasn't that bad on that spectrum either\n\nIt's weird. What if they invalidated overweight/obese people the way they invalidated people at the opposite end of the spectrum? \"No one is fat\" and they're vain/attention seeking for wanting to be called fat- they are Not Real\u2122\n\nAnd they just left them in the waiting rooms and therapists/Dr's told them \"food is good\" \"enjoy food\" if they said they had ED's on the BED spectrum, and scales told people they were 1kg",
