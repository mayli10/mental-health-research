I mean... what you're talking about is the concept of \"raising awareness,\" aka. exposing people to issues they may not have thought about themselves so that, if they want to, they could change their behaviour based on what they've learned. We do it for lots of other societal issues, so why not disordered eating?\n\n>I get where you're coming from, too, and I do try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but it actually IS important to raise awareness of the prevalence of invisible eating disorders and to educate people about how comments on people's appearances or eating habits can contribute unknowingly to those disorders.\n\n>I understand when people are ignorant to issues like this outside of their own lives, but that doesn't at all mean they should STAY ignorant or that it's wrong/childish/etc to want people to be educated on things they don't have direct experience with. That's how you grow empathy.\n\nSo you raise awareness by \"expecting\" them to do something? Or maybe you raise awareness by actively informing them?\n\n>I don't think this is practical advice when \"the world\" (aka. society) is a massive contributing factor to developing disordered eating. That's kind of like saying that it's a gay person's responsibility to manage homophobia because homophobes can't be expected to know any better. We HAVE to challenge society's attitude towards eating if we want to fully manage our disordered eating.\n\nAgain: you don't challenge anything if you just stay silent and expect the world to change for you without you doing anything. \n\nSecond, the comparison with homophobia is a meaningless one, as homophobes are precisely trying to hurt and fight gay people, whereas these people are just completely clueless. \n\nThe right comparison (well, it wouldn't be right in that case too, but let's just go on with it) would be if you got offended for an unwantingly homophobe comment from a very old woman born in a remote tiny village in the mountains of Nepal, who has never ever seen a gay person and doesn't know what it means as a concept, and of course doesn't know you're gay.\n\nYes, the world doesn't owe you anything. If you're an adult, it's your responsibility to try and get what you want.",

I mean... what you're talking about is the concept of \"raising awareness,\" aka. exposing people to issues they may not have thought about themselves so that, if they want to, they could change their behaviour based on what they've learned. We do it for lots of other societal issues, so why not disordered eating?\n\n>I get where you're coming from, too, and I do try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but it actually IS important to raise awareness of the prevalence of invisible eating disorders and to educate people about how comments on people's appearances or eating habits can contribute unknowingly to those disorders.\n\n>I understand when people are ignorant to issues like this outside of their own lives, but that doesn't at all mean they should STAY ignorant or that it's wrong/childish/etc to want people to be educated on things they don't have direct experience with. That's how you grow empathy.\n\nSo you raise awareness by \"expecting\" them to do something? Or maybe you raise awareness by actively informing them?\n\n>I don't think this is practical advice when \"the world\" (aka. society) is a massive contributing factor to developing disordered eating. That's kind of like saying that it's a gay person's responsibility to manage homophobia because homophobes can't be expected to know any better. We HAVE to challenge society's attitude towards eating if we want to fully manage our disordered eating.\n\nAgain: you don't challenge anything if you just stay silent and expect the world to change for you without you doing anything. \n\nSecond, the comparison with homophobia is a meaningless one, as homophobes are precisely trying to hurt and fight gay people, whereas these people are just completely clueless. \n\nThe right comparison (well, it wouldn't be right in that case too, but let's just go on with it) would be if you got offended for an unwantingly homophobe comment from a very old woman born in a remote tiny village in the mountains of Nepal, who has never ever seen a gay person and doesn't know what it means as a concept, and of course doesn't know you're gay.\n\nYes, the world doesn't owe you anything.

Jokes like this, even if they're meant to be light-hearted or a compliment, just reinforce the idea that people are paying close attention to and scrutinising your eating habits, which puts even MORE pressure on you. Like so many of us already have intrusive thoughts like \"if I pack this snack for lunch today then everyone is going to notice and say something and think about how many calories I'm consuming\" that stop us from being able to eat - it's so much WORSE if we actually have evidence to say it's true!\n\nI really wish commenting on people's eating habits was taken more seriously \ud83d\ude44 Might sound extreme but I seriously think it should be treated like religion, politics, or sex - aka. not an appropriate topic for most workplaces.",

I mean... what you're talking about is the concept of \"raising awareness,\" aka. exposing people to issues they may not have thought about themselves so that, if they want to, they could change their behaviour based on what they've learned. We do it for lots of other societal issues, so why not disordered eating?\n\n>I get where you're coming from, too, and I do try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but it actually IS important to raise awareness of the prevalence of invisible eating disorders and to educate people about how comments on people's appearances or eating habits can contribute unknowingly to those disorders.\n\n>I understand when people are ignorant to issues like this outside of their own lives, but that doesn't at all mean they should STAY ignorant or that it's wrong/childish/etc to want people to be educated on things they don't have direct experience with. That's how you grow empathy.\n\nSo you raise awareness by \"expecting\" them to do something? Or maybe you raise awareness by actively informing them?\n\n>I don't think this is practical advice when \"the world\" (aka. society) is a massive contributing factor to developing disordered eating. That's kind of like saying that it's a gay person's responsibility to manage homophobia because homophobes can't be expected to know any better. We HAVE to challenge society's attitude towards eating if we want to fully manage our disordered eating.\n\nAgain: you don't challenge anything if you just stay silent and expect the world to change for you without you doing anything. \n\nSecond, the comparison with homophobia is a meaningless one, as homophobes are precisely trying to hurt and fight gay people, whereas these people are just completely clueless. \n\nThe right comparison (well, it wouldn't be right in that case too, but let's just go on with it) would be if you got offended for an unwantingly homophobe comment from a very old woman born in a remote tiny village in the mountains of Nepal, who has never ever seen a gay person and doesn't know what it means as a concept, and of course doesn't know you're gay.\n\nYes, the world doesn't owe you anything. If you're an adult, it's your responsibility to try and get what you want.",

I mean... what you're talking about is the concept of \"raising awareness,\" aka. exposing people to issues they may not have thought about themselves so that, if they want to, they could change their behaviour based on what they've learned. We do it for lots of other societal issues, so why not disordered eating?\n\n>I get where you're coming from, too, and I do try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but it actually IS important to raise awareness of the prevalence of invisible eating disorders and to educate people about how comments on people's appearances or eating habits can contribute unknowingly to those disorders.\n\n>I understand when people are ignorant to issues like this outside of their own lives, but that doesn't at all mean they should STAY ignorant or that it's wrong/childish/etc to want people to be educated on things they don't have direct experience with. That's how you grow empathy.\n\nSo you raise awareness by \"expecting\" them to do something? Or maybe you raise awareness by actively informing them?\n\n>I don't think this is practical advice when \"the world\" (aka. society) is a massive contributing factor to developing disordered eating. That's kind of like saying that it's a gay person's responsibility to manage homophobia because homophobes can't be expected to know any better. We HAVE to challenge society's attitude towards eating if we want to fully manage our disordered eating.\n\nAgain: you don't challenge anything if you just stay silent and expect the world to change for you without you doing anything. \n\nSecond, the comparison with homophobia is a meaningless one, as homophobes are precisely trying to hurt and fight gay people, whereas these people are just completely clueless. \n\nThe right comparison (well, it wouldn't be right in that case too, but let's just go on with it) would be if you got offended for an unwantingly homophobe comment from a very old woman born in a remote tiny village in the mountains of Nepal, who has never ever seen a gay person and doesn't know what it means as a concept, and of course doesn't know you're gay.\n\nYes, the world doesn't owe you anything.

It's not something you would likely think of if you never had one. People with eating disorders are, luckily, a small subset of the population. \n\nPeople joke about random stuff all the time, especially about eating habits. I'm sure you joked about something not realizing that it might have hurt someone else around you. If you actively hide your ED and act like you're totally fine than it's only natural that people joke about your eating habits and it's honestly a bit childish of you to get offended.\n\nYou can't expect the world to revolve around and constantly accommodate your eating disorder. People are just living their life and not thinking about stuff that is important to you, and it's the same for you. They are not trying to offend you, be mean towards you or belittle your struggles. If you want them to act differently, just be open and tell them what you're going through and why such comments are hard for you to hear - otherwise be an adult and realize that the world doesn't owe you anything and managing your ED is your responsibility and yours only.\n\nYes, I also do get slightly offended when I hear similar stuff. I feel like they are insulting me and making fun of me. But then I realize that they just don't know, partly because I don't want them to know. They are clueless, thank God for them. So what should they do, read my mind? Get all kinds of careful towards a possible illness that they don't know anything about and never crosses their existence?",

I mean... what you're talking about is the concept of \"raising awareness,\" aka. exposing people to issues they may not have thought about themselves so that, if they want to, they could change their behaviour based on what they've learned. We do it for lots of other societal issues, so why not disordered eating?\n\n>I get where you're coming from, too, and I do try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but it actually IS important to raise awareness of the prevalence of invisible eating disorders and to educate people about how comments on people's appearances or eating habits can contribute unknowingly to those disorders.\n\n>I understand when people are ignorant to issues like this outside of their own lives, but that doesn't at all mean they should STAY ignorant or that it's wrong/childish/etc to want people to be educated on things they don't have direct experience with. That's how you grow empathy.\n\nSo you raise awareness by \"expecting\" them to do something? Or maybe you raise awareness by actively informing them?\n\n>I don't think this is practical advice when \"the world\" (aka. society) is a massive contributing factor to developing disordered eating. That's kind of like saying that it's a gay person's responsibility to manage homophobia because homophobes can't be expected to know any better. We HAVE to challenge society's attitude towards eating if we want to fully manage our disordered eating.\n\nAgain: you don't challenge anything if you just stay silent and expect the world to change for you without you doing anything. \n\nSecond, the comparison with homophobia is a meaningless one, as homophobes are precisely trying to hurt and fight gay people, whereas these people are just completely clueless. \n\nThe right comparison (well, it wouldn't be right in that case too, but let's just go on with it) would be if you got offended for an unwantingly homophobe comment from a very old woman born in a remote tiny village in the mountains of Nepal, who has never ever seen a gay person and doesn't know what it means as a concept, and of course doesn't know you're gay.\n\nYes, the world doesn't owe you anything. If you're an adult, it's your responsibility to try and get what you want.",
