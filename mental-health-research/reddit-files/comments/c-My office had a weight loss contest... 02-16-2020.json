But the world actually IS full of people who are judging you on your appearance and that has real consequences in your professional and personal life. People legit treat me worse now that I'm heavier and I'm only talking about going from a 16.5 to an 18 BMI. Part of the problem is self loathing and body dysmorphia, of course, but part of it is the fact that we live in a horrible messed up world that rewards unrealistic standards and unhealthy behavior. You can't just \"opt out\" of it, just as you can't \"opt out\" of misogyny, racism, classism or other systemic societal problems. You're always going to be implicated and affected by them in some way.",
