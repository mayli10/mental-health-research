A lot of times someone is dead set on starting to IV, and they\u2019re less likely to hurt/kill themselves if they know how to do it properly and how much to start with.\n\nMaybe that wasn\u2019t the context of that particular post, but I actually feel like /opiates was similar to /proed in that its primarily a supportive community that encourages recovery and promotes harm reduction.\n\n/drugs is another story lol",

For example, some people have depended on the sub for getting clean needles, which may be illegal to get in their state without a prescription or they live in a state with very judgemental pharmacists. This prevents the need to reuse needles which decreases the rate of HIV, hepatitis C, and other diseases. \n\nThe sub also helps people trying to find narcan which literally saves lives from reversing overdoses, and I know for a fact that it has saved at least 20 or more people. I wouldn\u2019t want people to judge me for how I deal with my eating disorder, please don\u2019t judge others with how they deal with their addiction, and lets stay mad at the people whose fault it is - Reddit.

Drugs like heroin, meth, ketamome ecstacy, and whatever else you could think of. They tell you how to access the markets, how trades work, and give advice and support on deals. I'm sure most users are buying for their own personal use but there's definitely some dealers on that sub, as well. So you've got a sub that is using reddit to actively encourage and support drug use and dealing.",
