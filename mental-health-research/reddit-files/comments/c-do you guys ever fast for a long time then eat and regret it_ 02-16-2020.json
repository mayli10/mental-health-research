Get super sick, for like 6 days.... eventually go to ER where they say you\u2019re completely fine; think it\u2019s all in your head; go on with your life for two weeks (not eating or drinking because you feel like shit tho); then have your appendix rupture at work. That\u2019s what the surgeon said they should have caught the first time. So now it been almost 4 weeks since I\u2019ve been able to eat or drink anything (no joke), only very very small things, and I regret it *every time.* So much nausea and pain. I can\u2019t really get out of bed, but I\u2019ve lost like 30 pounds (I just had a baby so no mean jokes here). I\u2019m getting back to where I need to be, baby... woohooo.

                "Text": "Yes, continuing to eat nothing is so much easier for me than eating a little bit, for a couple of reasons. If I eat enough to stop my hunger, for some reason it's likely to trigger a binge. I think because of BED, I only really register two feelings - hungry or full. So if I'm not hungry, but I'm also not full, it's like I get this frenzied urge to keep going until I AM full, because If I'm eating then I'm eating until I'm bursting and THAT'S when I know to stop! I still have room that needs to be filled! Hunger is way easier for me to ignore than that impulse.\n\nBut on the other hand, if I eat just enough that I'm still a bit hungry, it makes the hunger feel so much worse than before. IDK if it's all in my head (I mentally want to eat more and it makes me think I'm hungrier to try and make me) or if there's an actual phsyical component to it (maybe the digestion?). But in my mind I call this the 24 hour effect, because if I can ride it out for the rest of the day then as soon as I wake up, it's like it's way easier to deal with. I still feel hungry but it's just another sensation as opposed to an urge.",
