It\u2019s such a pleasant thing and we\u2019re so satisfied with the weight we\u2019ve lost! *sarcasm*} Like what the fuck people are so ignorant when it comes to this shit. My friends will say shit along these lines sometimes like \u201cI have the stomach bug. I wish it was the kind that made me puke so I could lose some weight & get skinny\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not gonna eat all day!/\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten all day!\u201d Like ok fucking shut the fuck up dude. I love my friends but like if you\u2019re truly struggling you keep that shit under lock and key and don\u2019t admit it, and actually most of the time people struggling with this will pretend they ate I feel like in my experience at least. Idk this shit aggravates me too. But I also will say I\u2019ve made jokes about doing something stupid and being like \u201comg i just did (insert random embarrassing incident) ugh I wanna kill myself\u201d which is just as, if not more, insensitive. I think people just speak in the moment or exaggerate or want attention but everything these days is super acknowledged and offended by but nonetheless I still agree. Just trying to illustrate it from both sides. Not this situation in OP\u2019s original post that shit is fucked up and uncalled for. I meant my examples lol sry for the long rant \ud83e\udd74",
