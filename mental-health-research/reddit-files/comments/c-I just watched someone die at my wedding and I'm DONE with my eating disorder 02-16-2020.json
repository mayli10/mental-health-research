As is it's already hard to think about pride in general since he passed during pride month, but I feel it would be even harder if I had actually done anything that day. I'm sure with time these feelings will pass though. I bet by next year I'll be over it.

As is it's already hard to think about pride in general since he passed during pride month, but I feel it would be even harder if I had actually done anything that day.

I had plans to head to the pride street fest in my city for the first time that day I can just imagine how awful it would have been if I had gone out and had a great day and then got that call in the evening rather than in the morning. As is it's already hard to think about pride in general since he passed during pride month, but I feel it would be even harder if I had actually done anything that day. I'm sure with time these feelings will pass though. I bet by next year I'll be over it. I'm sure in your case it will be a lot harder, but I still believe that with time you'll be able to separate the two events in your head so you can enjoy your memories of the wedding without being grief-stricken.

It's complicated, but essentially he just couldn't watch me self-destruct anymore. It took me a long time (about a year) but it was eventually the kick in the ass that I needed to get healthier and try recovery for real. We got back together after a year apart.\n\nNot trying to give you false hope or anything, just sharing my story. I can really, really empathize with your heartbreak. And I love that you're able to recognize that what YOU want and think is different from what your ED wants and thinks.\n\nWishing you the absolute best.",

Honestly the scariest thing is realizing how death can be so sudden and when you don\u2019t expect it. \n\nIn June I was a passenger in a car crash that resulted in the death of my closest family member, my grandmother. I only had a few nicks and was sore for some days but nothing that would be long lasting physically. I let myself eat whatever I wanted for a week and stress-ate and I\u2019m still here breathing in oxygen.\n\nYou are strong and things can get tough but I hope that you\u2019ll be able to get through it with your husband at your side.
