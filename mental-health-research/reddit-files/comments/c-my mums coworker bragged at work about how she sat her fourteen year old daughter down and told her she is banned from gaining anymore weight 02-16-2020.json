She gave me her diaries from my infancy which read as if she was inentionally trying to overfeed me as a baby.  Then I realized she always overfed me junk.  She never once told me she loved me.  It was the final piece to the puzzle -my previous therapists were right.  It's all because of my mother.  So in court.  When they called my name.  My heart beat slowed.  My emotion vanished.  My blood pressure dropped.  Just like a true psychopath.  You are 100% correct, except that psychopaths cannot feel rage.\n\n>Starving children is better than...\n\nYou cannot starve today if you have internet.  You have to try.  Really.  Fucking.  Hard.  You can't.  Go.  Try it.  I'm so confident you will fail, where do I place my money?",

She gave me her diaries from my infancy which read as if she was inentionally trying to overfeed me as a baby.  Then I realized she always overfed me junk.  She never once told me she loved me.  It was the final piece to the puzzle -my previous therapists were right.  It's all because of my mother.  So in court.  When they called my name.  My heart beat slowed.  My emotion vanished.  My blood pressure dropped.  Just like a true psychopath.  You are 100% correct, except that psychopaths cannot feel rage.\n\n>Starving children is better than...\n\nYou cannot starve today if you have internet.  You have to try.  Really.  Fucking.  Hard.  You can't.  Go.  Try it.  I'm so confident you will fail, where do I place my money?",

Kids should be taught to look at it that way.\n\nAlso iirc it's pretty normal for girls to gain a bit extra in their early teens... with healthy habits that usually sorts itself out in a few years. And if not, weight loss is better pursued once they're finished growing.\n\nA younger cousin of mine once confided in me that she still felt like she needed to loose weight asap, since it is \"harder when you're older\". I told her that meant post middle age, not post puberty, and that it will in fact be much easier (not to mention more advisable) in her late teens than early teens. I don't think she took it to heart but eh I tried :p",

But back then I feel like I didn't eat enough to make me fat since as a 12 year old I had no money and I ate the food that was made by my parents.\n\nAnother thing I wish I had was a group of friends who are all obsessed with calories. Like the plastics type of group from mean girls. I feel like that could've helped too but oh well, gotta do it by myself now",

Kids should be taught to look at it that way.\n\nAlso iirc it's pretty normal for girls to gain a bit extra in their early teens... with healthy habits that usually sorts itself out in a few years. And if not, weight loss is better pursued once they're finished growing.\n\nA younger cousin of mine once confided in me that she still felt like she needed to loose weight asap, since it is \"harder when you're older\". I told her that meant post middle age, not post puberty, and that it will in fact be much easier (not to mention more advisable) in her late teens than early teens. I don't think she took it to heart but eh I tried :p",

She gave me her diaries from my infancy which read as if she was inentionally trying to overfeed me as a baby.  Then I realized she always overfed me junk.  She never once told me she loved me.  It was the final piece to the puzzle -my previous therapists were right.  It's all because of my mother.  So in court.  When they called my name.  My heart beat slowed.  My emotion vanished.  My blood pressure dropped.  Just like a true psychopath.  You are 100% correct, except that psychopaths cannot feel rage.\n\n>Starving children is better than...\n\nYou cannot starve today if you have internet.  You have to try.  Really.  Fucking.  Hard.  You can't.  Go.  Try it.  I'm so confident you will fail, where do I place my money?",

It was the final piece to the puzzle -my previous therapists were right.  It's all because of my mother.  So in court.  When they called my name.  My heart beat slowed.  My emotion vanished.

She then sat me down and told me that she\u2019s noticed I\u2019m gaining weight and that I need to eat less because I can\u2019t gain anymore. I cried so much and she didn\u2019t regret anything she said. I was also only a bmi of 25 (just barely overweight).\n\nNow I barely eat anything. (TW: calories) I eat below 600 calories most days unless I binge because I\u2019m so deprived. Last weekend I stayed in bed crying all Saturday because of how much I hate myself. I have absolutely no self confidence at all. I\u2019ve lost almost 30 pounds but I hate myself now more than ever.

Which is not something I ate regularly, only occasionally like on a piece of pie. He was \"subtle\" about it and just talked about \"empty calories\" but wtf. If he thought I was too fat to be eating a piece of pie - and believe me, I already thought I was insanely fat (although I was of a normal weight, just on the higher end) - maybe he should've fucking taken that away. You know, instead of frowning at me as I ate the pie, and banning whipped cream.\n\nI proceeded to spend years underweight, but the second I snapped and gained enough weight to hit a normal BMI, my dad freaked out and told me to stop eating so \"much\" (it was a perfectly normal amount, imo) bc I was going to get overweight.

Kids should be taught to look at it that way.\n\nAlso iirc it's pretty normal for girls to gain a bit extra in their early teens... with healthy habits that usually sorts itself out in a few years. And if not, weight loss is better pursued once they're finished growing.\n\nA younger cousin of mine once confided in me that she still felt like she needed to loose weight asap, since it is \"harder when you're older\". I told her that meant post middle age, not post puberty, and that it will in fact be much easier (not to mention more advisable) in her late teens than early teens. I don't think she took it to heart but eh I tried :p",

And if not, weight loss is better pursued once they're finished growing.\n\nA younger cousin of mine once confided in me that she still felt like she needed to loose weight asap, since it is \"harder when you're older\". I told her that meant post middle age, not post puberty, and that it will in fact be much easier (not to mention more advisable) in her late teens than early teens.

                        "Text": ">Rage filled psychopath.\n\nMy mother filed a restraining order against me.  She gave me her diaries from my infancy which read as if she was inentionally trying to overfeed me as a baby.  Then I realized she always overfed me junk.  She never once told me she loved me.  It was the final piece to the puzzle -my previous therapists were right.  It's all because of my mother.  So in court.  When they called my name.  My heart beat slowed.  My emotion vanished.  My blood pressure dropped.  Just like a true psychopath.  You are 100% correct, except that psychopaths cannot feel rage.\n\n>Starving children is better than...\n\nYou cannot starve today if you have internet.  You have to try.  Really.  Fucking.  Hard.  You can't.  Go.  Try it.  I'm so confident you will fail, where do I place my money?",

Keep in mind, many of us here are not experienced having healthy conversations about food with parents.\n\nWhat SHOULD happen is parents should provide healthy and balanced meals to their children. They should teach children about their bodies and what nutrients it needs and which foods provide you with those nutrients. Children should get to look at the produce in grocery stores and be involved in choosing vegetables and cooking them up. Sweets should be discussed of as something that is great in small portions, but can make you sick when had too regularly.\n\nUnfortunately most parents dont know about food themselves! Our obesity epidemic can show you that!\n\nI'm sorry your parents suck, but saying that shaming this girl is good is wrong. There are better ways.",

Kids should be taught to look at it that way.\n\nAlso iirc it's pretty normal for girls to gain a bit extra in their early teens... with healthy habits that usually sorts itself out in a few years. And if not, weight loss is better pursued once they're finished growing.\n\nA younger cousin of mine once confided in me that she still felt like she needed to loose weight asap, since it is \"harder when you're older\". I told her that meant post middle age, not post puberty, and that it will in fact be much easier (not to mention more advisable) in her late teens than early teens. I don't think she took it to heart but eh I tried :p",

Kids should be taught to look at it that way.\n\nAlso iirc it's pretty normal for girls to gain a bit extra in their early teens... with healthy habits that usually sorts itself out in a few years. And if not, weight loss is better pursued once they're finished growing.\n\nA younger cousin of mine once confided in me that she still felt like she needed to loose weight asap, since it is \"harder when you're older\". I told her that meant post middle age, not post puberty, and that it will in fact be much easier (not to mention more advisable) in her late teens than early teens.
