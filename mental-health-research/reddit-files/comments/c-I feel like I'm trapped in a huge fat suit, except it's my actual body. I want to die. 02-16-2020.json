Buying foods that need preparation only help a lot (ex: raw eggs, low cal pasta, raw meat, plain vegetables, etc.) Not having readily available pre packaged food does wonders because you have to predetermine how big of a portion you're going to eat before you cook it. There's no going back for immediate extras if you need to spend another 20-45 minutes making it.\n\nIt's a lot healthier, and you can decide what goes in it. It's also pretty damn fun to learn how to cook.",
