My boyfriend and my partner are the only ones that know the true extent of my ED and they're both awesome at handling my freak outs around food. I don't think that my parents and my sister suspect about my orthorexia, but they have a very relaxed attitude when it comes to eating, so I never feel pressured to eat more or less than what I want. Also they're just really nice people and we're extremely close. \n\nIf I'm having a meal alone I tend to be extremely restrictive, but it's even worse if I'm eating in front of strangers (like in between lectures in college). In those situations I just can't eat. I have little snacks at most, like an apple, or a handful of almonds, or a few cherry tomatoes, but never anything substantial. Which is insane and super inadequate for my energy expenditure. I feel... Watched? Which makes no sense, because why would people care about what or if I'm eating? But still, I can't help it, even though I should really try and work on this issue as it's destroying my recovery efforts during the semester.\n\nWeirdly enough, I restrict even when I'm with close friends. They don't know about my ortho, and while they know that I am very into fitness, they don't know that I burn over 3000 calories in an average day. So I end up eating what is \"socially expected\" for a woman my size, and not the \"big\" dinner that I'd really need. And which I have no problem eating if I'm at home with my boyfriend.",
