                            "Text": "Yes, it\u2019s much cheaper and less risky. Produce takes weeks/months to grow, then has to be picked (often by hand), then has to be processed for quality, then has to be packaged, and then finally is shipped to stores. They risk a bad crop due to weather issues, parasites or pests, groundwater contamination (lookin at you, romaine lettuce), etc. Not to mention the fact that many farmers buy seeds that are genetically modified to not produce seeds, so they have to buy them every year from the supplier. They have immense water and land costs as well. \n\nProcessed food may have a higher R&D cost initially, but they only need those food scientists once per product. After that, the product can be made forever and not need another scientist to work on it. The factories have far fewer employees when you look at the yield of processed food vs the yield of produce. They don\u2019t have to wait weeks/months for one single batch of the product to be done, they crank hundreds or thousands out daily. The ingredients are low quality, often used subsidized crops, and are incredibly cheap in bulk.",

Produce takes weeks/months to grow, then has to be picked (often by hand), then has to be processed for quality, then has to be packaged, and then finally is shipped to stores. They risk a bad crop due to weather issues, parasites or pests, groundwater contamination (lookin at you, romaine lettuce), etc. Not to mention the fact that many farmers buy seeds that are genetically modified to not produce seeds, so they have to buy them every year from the supplier. They have immense water and land costs as well. \n\nProcessed food may have a higher R&D cost initially, but they only need those food scientists once per product. After that, the product can be made forever and not need another scientist to work on it. The factories have far fewer employees when you look at the yield of processed food vs the yield of produce. They don\u2019t have to wait weeks/months for one single batch of the product to be done, they crank hundreds or thousands out daily. The ingredients are low quality, often used subsidized crops, and are incredibly cheap in bulk.",

Produce takes weeks/months to grow, then has to be picked (often by hand), then has to be processed for quality, then has to be packaged, and then finally is shipped to stores. They risk a bad crop due to weather issues, parasites or pests, groundwater contamination (lookin at you, romaine lettuce), etc. Not to mention the fact that many farmers buy seeds that are genetically modified to not produce seeds, so they have to buy them every year from the supplier. They have immense water and land costs as well. \n\nProcessed food may have a higher R&D cost initially, but they only need those food scientists once per product. After that, the product can be made forever and not need another scientist to work on it. The factories have far fewer employees when you look at the yield of processed food vs the yield of produce. They don\u2019t have to wait weeks/months for one single batch of the product to be done, they crank hundreds or thousands out daily. The ingredients are low quality, often used subsidized crops, and are incredibly cheap in bulk.",

                            "Text": "Yes, it\u2019s much cheaper and less risky. Produce takes weeks/months to grow, then has to be picked (often by hand), then has to be processed for quality, then has to be packaged, and then finally is shipped to stores. They risk a bad crop due to weather issues, parasites or pests, groundwater contamination (lookin at you, romaine lettuce), etc. Not to mention the fact that many farmers buy seeds that are genetically modified to not produce seeds, so they have to buy them every year from the supplier. They have immense water and land costs as well. \n\nProcessed food may have a higher R&D cost initially, but they only need those food scientists once per product. After that, the product can be made forever and not need another scientist to work on it. The factories have far fewer employees when you look at the yield of processed food vs the yield of produce. They don\u2019t have to wait weeks/months for one single batch of the product to be done, they crank hundreds or thousands out daily. The ingredients are low quality, often used subsidized crops, and are incredibly cheap in bulk.",

                            "Text": "Yes, it\u2019s much cheaper and less risky. Produce takes weeks/months to grow, then has to be picked (often by hand), then has to be processed for quality, then has to be packaged, and then finally is shipped to stores. They risk a bad crop due to weather issues, parasites or pests, groundwater contamination (lookin at you, romaine lettuce), etc. Not to mention the fact that many farmers buy seeds that are genetically modified to not produce seeds, so they have to buy them every year from the supplier. They have immense water and land costs as well. \n\nProcessed food may have a higher R&D cost initially, but they only need those food scientists once per product. After that, the product can be made forever and not need another scientist to work on it. The factories have far fewer employees when you look at the yield of processed food vs the yield of produce. They don\u2019t have to wait weeks/months for one single batch of the product to be done, they crank hundreds or thousands out daily. The ingredients are low quality, often used subsidized crops, and are incredibly cheap in bulk.",

Produce takes weeks/months to grow, then has to be picked (often by hand), then has to be processed for quality, then has to be packaged, and then finally is shipped to stores. They risk a bad crop due to weather issues, parasites or pests, groundwater contamination (lookin at you, romaine lettuce), etc. Not to mention the fact that many farmers buy seeds that are genetically modified to not produce seeds, so they have to buy them every year from the supplier. They have immense water and land costs as well. \n\nProcessed food may have a higher R&D cost initially, but they only need those food scientists once per product. After that, the product can be made forever and not need another scientist to work on it. The factories have far fewer employees when you look at the yield of processed food vs the yield of produce. They don\u2019t have to wait weeks/months for one single batch of the product to be done, they crank hundreds or thousands out daily. The ingredients are low quality, often used subsidized crops, and are incredibly cheap in bulk.",

                            "Text": "Yes, it\u2019s much cheaper and less risky. Produce takes weeks/months to grow, then has to be picked (often by hand), then has to be processed for quality, then has to be packaged, and then finally is shipped to stores. They risk a bad crop due to weather issues, parasites or pests, groundwater contamination (lookin at you, romaine lettuce), etc. Not to mention the fact that many farmers buy seeds that are genetically modified to not produce seeds, so they have to buy them every year from the supplier. They have immense water and land costs as well. \n\nProcessed food may have a higher R&D cost initially, but they only need those food scientists once per product. After that, the product can be made forever and not need another scientist to work on it. The factories have far fewer employees when you look at the yield of processed food vs the yield of produce. They don\u2019t have to wait weeks/months for one single batch of the product to be done, they crank hundreds or thousands out daily. The ingredients are low quality, often used subsidized crops, and are incredibly cheap in bulk.",
