When they saw me they told me I'm going to die. Which apparently I wasn't so much a turn off enough yet to not be attractive enough to not have sex with, so...? My ED brain is now unsure if that means I haven't actually lost enough weight yet?\n\nFor dinner it was really cute that they bought a few packages of [food], except they made me eat all of it (which to be fair I did happily since I love it and it's fairly low calories while being protein) and kept telling me I've lost too much weight and need to eat.\n\nIt's validating but also depressing that I can't even see my own changes. For all I know I look larger than when I started.",

It was a weird mixed bag of feeling proud that my weight loss was that noticeable, but also panicked that she might find out I wasn't losing weight the \"healthy\" way, and also guilty for making her worry over me.\n\nI think it's normal to feel proud in a way because it's like a separate bracket for people noticing your weightloss. There's \"Have you lost weight?\", then there's \"Wow, you look great!\", and then there's \"Are you okay...?\" When you hit the last one you know your weightloss is undeniable.",

Got on the scale the next day, and I had! And my first thought was \"They must have been secretly judging my fatness this whole time and if I gain it back they will notice that too,\" so now I'm restricting again just like that.
