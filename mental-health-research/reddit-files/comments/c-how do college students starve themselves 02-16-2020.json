I came from a small town where food options are McDonalds, cheap diner, expensive restaurant, so moving to a college town where there are a hundred thousand options to eat has made it so hard to stay on track. I wanna try all the pizza places and get insomnia cookies and go to all the cafes. I'm just now finishing off leftover breadsticks and I swear im only eating healthy from now on.\n\nWe'll see how everything plays out through the rest of the year though lmao",

I came from a small town where food options are McDonalds, cheap diner, expensive restaurant, so moving to a college town where there are a hundred thousand options to eat has made it so hard to stay on track. I wanna try all the pizza places and get insomnia cookies and go to all the cafes. I'm just now finishing off leftover breadsticks and I swear im only eating healthy from now on.\n\nWe'll see how everything plays out through the rest of the year though lmao",

It sucks a lot because whenever i have some like weekend where my bf is out of town or something i always feel like i HAVE to fast because it's my ONLY chance because i can just lay in bed all day \n\nBecause if i have to go to work I just move so slowly and am so lethargic if I've been fasting for a while that my coworkers get pissed off at me\n\nWhat's weird is it wasnt always this way, when I was like 18 I could fast for days or low restrict and be fine but maybe it's because I WAS in college and only had to function for a few hours a day and could sleep in still idk",
