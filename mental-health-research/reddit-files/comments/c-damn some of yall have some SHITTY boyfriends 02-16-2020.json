Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

I definitely relate to having to sort of re-calibrate yourself and your jokes for a queer audience vs. a not-queer audience because they can be perceived and used VERY differently, but on top of that, we get a lot of lurkers here who are just straight-up assholes, so it pays to be extra careful.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes.

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

I definitely relate to having to sort of re-calibrate yourself and your jokes for a queer audience vs. a not-queer audience because they can be perceived and used VERY differently, but on top of that, we get a lot of lurkers here who are just straight-up assholes, so it pays to be extra careful.",

And this was only one facet of the ways in which I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

And this was only one facet of the ways in which I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

He's a bit awkward about it. But he always lets me know he's there to listen, and always reassures me how much he loves my body (even when I don't believe him). I honestly don't think my mental health could handle a relationship where my ED is triggered and I don't think anybody should put up with that BS.",

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse.

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

I\u2019m just now coming to that realization (thanks therapy!) and while it doesn\u2019t excuse any awful thing he did, it was definitely partly my own self hatred fueled choices that kept me there. \n\nThe things he said and did toward me about my (perfectly normal healthy BMI) weight were ridiculous and every man I\u2019ve told about them has been flabbergasted.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

                            "Text": "Of the awful shit? Yeah, I could go on for days! Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

And this was only one facet of the ways in which I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise. They were unfounded and uncalled for.",

It can be an addictive feeling and it can almost be comforting when it makes restricting/purging easier without as much conscious effort from yourself (at the expense of your mental health and self-worth in other areas). But I really hope everyone in a relationship like that can learn they don't deserve that, that they should have better.",

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse.

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

They don't open on the first date with \"Hi, I'm a Capricorn, and I think you're a useless fat cow,\" because that would drop their success rate to near (but unfortunately not total) zero. They start off loving and supportive, then drop a few lines about faux concern or quiet frustration, and when they get away with that, they build it up until they're screaming at you about how fat and ugly you are and you're sitting there wondering what you did to deserve it.\n\nTruth is you did nothing but trust your partner. This is what they had been building up to the entire time. Getting away from an abusive relationship is difficult and scary but it gives you freedom.",

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse.

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

I had already told him in the past to not share my medical information with my family. He then said well you didn't tell me not to share it (actually I did but you forgot)\n\nWhen I told him how hurt I was over both those things, that I wouldn't be telling him any more of my medical information because I know he can't keep it to himself, that I cried on one of my classes at uni because of the fat joke (he said it whilst we were on our way to campus), he replied \n\n'I give up'\n\nokay. guess I give up too. I'm sick of being half-loved because he never fucking acknowledges that my ED is part of my worldly experience. I love him but he's so fucking stupid when it comes to giving any type of apology without a 'but!!'. I know he knows my Reddit username and I honestly hope he reads this. You treat me like SHIT when it's all of me not just who I am when I have my eating disorder under control. Fuck you. I went to your relative's funeral and held you when you cried and although said relative was pretty much a stranger I went to his hospital bedside and watched your whole family cry not knowing a single thing to do or say. I was uncomfortable but I loved you and stayed because you needed me. It's not a nice feeling meeting your extended family all at once at a funeral but I took it because I loved you.\n \nSo where the fuck are you now when I've told you that I have serious body image issues and an ED and you STILL can't give a fucking proper apology for making a fat joke. You give up. You're fucking weak.",

He's trying to make YOU forget, to make you doubt what you said. He's a little worm and he's trying to squirm away from being a decent person.\n\n> 'I give up' \n\nMore gaslighting! More trying to make you seem like the irrational, unreliable one! Like YOU'RE the problem for establishing boundaries. Asking your partner not to make jokes about your weight and not to share your medical history are PERFECTLY REASONABLE and also INCREDIBLY EASY for him to achieve, so for him to say he \"gives up\" is just pathetic. He knows that what he did wasn't okay, and he knew it wasn't okay before he did it, too.\n\nYou're right. He IS weak. He's weak he's weak he's weak. He's not giving up because clearly he never tried in the first place. He needs to grow the fuck up or you need to get out of there.",

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse.

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes.

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

                        "Text": "No, it's because abusive men (abusive anyone, but we're specifically talking about men) target vulnerable people. Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

We went out earlier to get a pizza and he knew I wanted a cookie to share, but couldn't get it myself, and helped make the decision of the one to get because I told him I wasn't in the mindset to make that decision today. Beyond accommodating. It's way easier to take care of yourself the way you should when you have someone supporting you and loving you the way you deserve, guys. Having a rough day? That's fine. Feeling good and want to enjoy that? That's fine too. Enjoy life, love yourself, and start demanding the type of treatment and love you deserve, because you fucking rock. That is all.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

                            "Text": "No, it's because abusive men (abusive anyone, but we're specifically talking about men) target vulnerable people. Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise. They were unfounded and uncalled for.",

He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes.

Society has raised us to believe that being single is shameful but it's powerful, it's freeing. It's the freedom to do whatever you want whenever you want and to put your own priorities and needs first, to not have to walk on eggshells around other people, to be able to dedicate all of your time to finding what makes you happy. If your partner lets you do all of those things, too, then your relationship is a positive addition to your life! But you don't NEED one and I just wish more people felt confident in choosing to be happy and empowered alone than staying in a relationship they think they have to be in.",

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

                        "Text": "No, it's because abusive men (abusive anyone, but we're specifically talking about men) target vulnerable people. Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

Evidently, it's not what you meant.

I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise.

(ofc i know not all ED sufferers are women but it's much more common; wlw relationships can also be abusive or unhealthy just like any relationship--my first gf contributed to my ED a lot--but this is my experience now)\n\nbecause--then your partner understands what it's like as a woman in society, certain materialistics pressures that can contribute to EDs, had probably received unwarranted comments and has more respect for boundaries--but more than just that, loving the body of another woman can help u love your own. i know with my gf, even though sometimes she can say triggering things unintentionally (much like anyone else!), she tries her best to be there for me no matter what even if she doesn't understand completely. i feel awful about my body a lot of the time, but then she tells me likes me whether or not my body changes. i look at stretch marks on my thighs and i hate my legs but then i remember she has stretch marks too and i love them, i love her. she reminds me that i can absolutely be at a \\~healthy\\~ weight and still be a lovely attractive human being. a lot of relationships i've had before were very unhealthy for me with my ED, mostly with men, because they never understood, and didn't try, essentially complacent in furthering my disorder. but women, supporting women, platonic or romantic or otherwise, helping rather than furthering stigma, is such a beautiful, wonderful thing to be a part of. just my input but i know there are other gays in here and i think this was a kinda important revelation for me.\n\n*(tldr;* *~~be~~****im*** *a lesbian)*",

I like your first parenthes and I agree, wlw relationships are just as capable of being abusive. In this case what you're saying is less about men being abusive and just a general low-level of dismissal so many men hold for the problems women experience and their particular relationships with body image. Even well-meaning men can tend to assume that women are exaggerating or mistaken, or just not be able to understand/relate, which can get exhausting.\n\nThat said. I know you probably already understand a bit because you edited your post, but the \"dump your boyfriend, get a girlfriend instead\" mentality is still in your post, and still damaging for a couple of reasons. One, it perpetuates the stereotype that lesbians/wlw are \"predatory\" and actively try to turn women, especially vulnerable women who have just broken up with a man. Two, it suggests that sexuality is a choice, which is an old argument I think some of the younger LGBTQ+ crowd has not been exposed to as much, but it always circles back around to the idea it's possible to choose to be straight, to undergo conversion to become straight, etc.\n\nLike I said, I feel like you know this already, on some level. And I don't want this to detract from your own personal experiences with relationships and your own feelings of validation and joy and relief (all good!! very good!!) dating women after dating men. But it also pays to be mindful if it moves from personal recount into advice.",

                        "Text": "Of the awful shit? Yeah, I could go on for days! Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

                        "Text": "No, it's because abusive men (abusive anyone, but we're specifically talking about men) target vulnerable people. Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

And this was only one facet of the ways in which I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes.

                        "Text": "I agree with you, as I said in my own reply, that women in abusive relationships absolutely and should learn to recognise that they do not deserve abuse and to leave the relationship, but there was no way to know that's what you meant from what you originally said. Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise. They were unfounded and uncalled for.",

Its frustrating, because to me, her depression and anxiety were exhausting to deal with, and it was exhausting to see her beat her self up all the time. In my mind, I saw that her anxiety and depression were caused by her poor body image. I thought, all she needs to do is lose 20 pounds and this chapter can be behind her. She could focus on actually living life. But its like she never saw the light at the end of the tunnel like I did. She kept yo yoing. It was frustrating. It seemed like such a simple problem - you want to lose weight so badly, then just quite eating things that make you fat. In my head, it all made sense to me. Yet, in 3 years of dating, she could never keep to a goal. So, when she asked to grab ice cream, I was cold with her, and when she inquired, I told her how I felt. I see now that Ive been a controlling little twat my whole life, and Im grateful to have learned this lesson. I wish I could take back all the rude things ive done or said. I think maybe this situation is common for people with ED. People with ED like self-dicipline and probably seak it out in their partners. These partbers, being diciplined, may have achieved that characteristic by being (self or otherwise) controlling, cold and logical. They could also have achieved it through self love and passion, but my case was the former. Anyways, thats my 2c",

Unfortunately I think the reality is that many people with EDs are emotionally vulnerable and either consciously or subconsciously seek out abusive partners who will intentionally trigger their EDs because they want to continue their disordered behaviour, and they find that easier with external pressure from a partner.

Trigger warning for hurtful things said by an awful person. \n\nWhen we first got together the first thing he said about my weight was \u201cI usually date thin women\u201d which was actually the nicest thing he ever said to me about it. For reference, I was/am 5\u20193 and 125. So not super skinny, but a healthy weight and not fat either. \n\nFrom then on it was constant fights about my \u201cweight problem\u201d. He told me he would resent and hate me if I never lost the weight, told me I was destined to be fat like my mom when I got older, untagged himself in pictures of us on social media because I didn\u2019t look thin enough in the picture, told me he was embarrassed to be seen with me, got incredibly angry if I skipped my 5 am daily jog because I was sick or tired. \n\nHe actively encouraged disordered eating. When I was in a restricting phase he was happy. He said it was fine to just starve myself until I wasn\u2019t heavy anymore. When I was actually trying to be balanced and healthy and watch my calories in a normal way he would get upset with me that I wouldn\u2019t want to eat pizza and pancakes and ice cream with him. \n\nOne time during an argument about it I told him I felt like he didn\u2019t even love me and he shouted back \u201cWell then why can\u2019t you just stop being fat so I can love you?!?!\u201d  \n\nWhen his ex got pregnant with her new husband he told me how he wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her anymore. He said \u201cyeah, now SHE\u2019LL be the fat one\u201d. \n\nOne of my \u201dfavorite\u201d fights was when he told me I shouldn\u2019t drive and park near the bus I needed to take into the city for a night class. He said I should walk by myself almost two miles late at night through a not great neighborhood instead so I could get more exercise. When I pointed out that people get robbed or worse every day doing that he said \u201cWell, people die of obesity and heart disease every day too, but you\u2019re clearly not concerned about that\u201d. \n\nThat hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface of it, but like I said, I could go on for days and you get the idea. \n\nI\u2019m out of it now, thank goodness.  But I\u2019m still dealing with the immense damage it caused me. It\u2019s not worth staying with someone like this. I\u2019ve always had eating issues, anxiety, and low self worth. But he turned the dial up to 11 and I\u2019m really floundering right now trying to catch my breath again.",

I notice it a lot in forums where women who are mentally ill or women who were abused talk about their experiences.\n\nNow that I think about it, there's a girl I went on a date with recently and I had been trying to get her to go out with me for months and she was completely clueless while I thought I was being very clear. When she finally realized I was actually asking her out she said something about how she never imagined somebody like me could possibly like her. I know she struggles a lot with her mental health because of her ED and her home life and that she had been in an abusive relationship before, so I think it's pretty clear how this comes to be and I wouldn't say that it's ever the woman's fault. Women who put up with this kind of thing have been beaten into submission by a lifetime of heartache and abuse. Most often they never learned what real love looks like as children and therefore have no idea what to expect when dating as adults.",

Do you really think they enter into relationships being cruel and abusive from the start? They're nice and sweet at first, then slowly start pushing boundaries for how mean they can be, and vulnerable people are less likely to be confident in their self-worth. The abusive person is manipulating the situation to make them seem like they're in the right and the person being abused is left questioning their sanity, especially since many abusive partners swing wildly from abuse to affection, which lulls the abused party into thinking that they can still fix/save the relationship.\n\nYou sound like you think abused people choose to be abused, and that they're not already in a vulnerable position or being actively manipulated over a long period of time by someone they thought they could trust, especially when most abusers are able to act normal and caring around other people, so everyone else in the abused person's life is telling them things are okay. The answer to abuse is not \"well just stop being abused then\". Especially not when trying to leave an abusive relationship can be dangerous without a support network, something else abusers often cut out early before the abused person can realise what's going on.\n\nI guess you feel like it gives you power over yourself, control over your own life, to think that abused people are abused because of a personal weakness or failing? And so because you don't want to be abused, you could never be in an abusive relationship? The truth is that anyone can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Nobody is \"safe\" just because they think \"I would never let that happen to me\". And if you ever do find yourself in an abusive relationship, it wouldn't be your fault, either.",

And this was only one facet of the ways in which I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. He also regularly reminded me that my career is stupid and embarrassing, that I grew up poor and am destined to be poor my whole life, that I am a bad conversationalist and boring, etc, etc. \n\nWhen I tell people he was mean to me about my weight or called me fat they don\u2019t get how bad it really was. And I don\u2019t blame them. I don\u2019t tell most people in real life about all of this stuff because it\u2019s very deeply embarrassing to me - both that he thought I deserved to be treated that way and that I put up with it. It was really really awful. Sometimes I wish he\u2019d just hit me because physical abuse is easier to explain to people than emotional abuse. It goes so much deeper than just saying mean things. It\u2019s a slow but total wearing down of your personhood. \n\nI\u2019m starting to build back up, but it\u2019s a slow and painful process. I know it\u2019s kind of silly, but talking about it on reddit really helps. I post in r/narcissisticabuse sometimes. Seeing that other people are shocked by his words and actions helps remind me that it really was that bad and really wasn\u2019t okay and I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

                        "Text": "I agree with you, as I said in my own reply, that women in abusive relationships absolutely and should learn to recognise that they do not deserve abuse and to leave the relationship, but there was no way to know that's what you meant from what you originally said. Someone asked the (rhetorical) question of \"why do men do this?\" and you answered with \"because women put up with it.\" That's all I had available to respond to. Evidently, it's not what you meant. But you can't fault people for reading that you think men abuse women because women let them and interpreting that to mean you're blaming them.\n\nAlso,  \n\n> it bothers me when people act like victims like me were completely at the whims of our abusers and can't do anything for ourselves.\n\nSome victims absolutely are at the whims of their abusers and cannot easily seek help without the threat of violence or death, especially since many abusers isolate the victims from their support systems. I'm glad that wasn't your experience, but it's not a universal experience. And for what it's worth, I'm speaking from my own experience with abusive relationships, too.\n\nEdit: Rereading my other comment though I do see how many assumptions I made about you and your background and I apologise. They were unfounded and uncalled for.",
