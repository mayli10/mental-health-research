They\u2019ve deeply engrained their habit of overeating over the years making it hard to break, have no motivation because once you reach a certain weight losing even a hundred pounds still leaves you morbidly obese, and as a result of their mental and physical health being so poor they act poorly.\n\nI feel nothing but sympathy for these people.

I've never been 500 pounds but I was almost at 300, and I know that's not really comparable, but it still sucks sometimes to look in the mirror and see someone who has lost 88lb and still just barely managed to slip from the \"obese\" category to the \"overweight\" category without wondering what the fucking point is. It feels sometimes like Zeno's paradox, will I always lose weight without ever actually reaching a size I'm comfortable with? Will I always struggle with denying myself food yet never be accepted by society? If that's the case then why lose at all? (I keep going bc I don't want to lose my progress, but I'm afraid of gaining it back in the future.)\n\nFWIW I think this is a good post and I'm grateful you shared your insight. TBH I was nervous when I read the first paragraph because there are so many thinly-veiled fathate posts here with a tiny disclaimer at the start like \"okay I know it's like so bad of me teehee but does anyone else think fat people are disgusting subhumans???\" but I really appreciate your honesty in both the way you used to feel, and your new insight into their thought process and the way you're trying to change your thinking.  \nIDK anything about those two YouTubers in particular but maybe you could add some other bloggers to your routine who don't behave badly. There are people in recovery from restrictive EDs who went on to struggle with binging whose experiences you may also be able to relate to.",

I think ultimately it's never about size, it's about worth - we read posts on here from people who feel awful in their bodies and want to go lower whether they're 90 or 290 pounds, you know?  Thanks for giving me the benefit of the doubt - I've been really troubled lately by reddit-wide attitudes toward weight loss, and this sub (ironically) offers the healthiest and most considered perspective in my opinion.  It's all good to echo back \"it's just CICO!!!!!\" and congratulate each other on not being like the Bad Fat People with no consideration of the social or psychological mindfuck we're all wading through.

                "Text": "I'm so glad for this subreddit because I have these conversations internally with myself all the time but I can't talk to anyone in my life who would understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent most of my life morbidly obese and have lost 150+ pounds and kept it off. Weight loss itself is easy (it's just math). The hardest part of my weight loss journey was actually the two years I spent exercising and not losing weight and trying to change my habits. Once I found a way mentally to give up the food and cut my portions, the weight disappeared pretty quickly. Even though it took a while, it's really not that bad because you see the drop on the scale every so often (keeps you motivated) and even after a full year of doing it, it doesn't get boring or old, and at that point you're not really \"slaving away at it\" because you've found a way to make weight loss habitual at that point. It does suck looking in the mirror and not really seeing progress for a long time though due to the \"paper towel effect\". 90% of my visual changes happened in the last 25% of my weight loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think the average obese person really suffers as much as most people think. At least I didn't. It's an easy state to live in in today's age with the obesity epidemic making it more common (comfort in numbers, fat acceptance, etc), much better clothing options, plenty of hobbies to engage in that don't require physical fitness. The negatives of being obese and ostracized for your obesity are in large part offset by the fact that you're able to live a very unrestricted lifestyle where you literally eat and drink whatever you want all the time. I do remember how sad I was at times being obese, especially while growing up, and thinking to myself \"I'll never be normal\" \"I'll never fit in\" etc. Psychologically it can be miserable at times. But on the whole you don't really think about it, it just becomes your reality and you learn to focus on the things that really matter in life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though I'm physically healthier, I am worth no more or less than I was before I lost the weight. All the weight I lost cannot buy me another single day on this Earth, cannot bring my deceased friends or family back from the dead, cannot make anyone love me, and cannot stop me from continually undermining myself and making mistakes, being the imperfect human being that I am. It cannot allow me to love myself or accept myself for who I am. It can't make me love what I see in the mirror. I don't want anyone to be obese. I don't want anyone to suffer unnecessarily from food addiction, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic syndrome complications. At the same time, it's really true what they say in that losing weight can't cast out the demons in your head. I view the weight loss as more of a consequence of God's work in my life and internal changes on the spiritual and emotional plane that I needed to go through to facilitate the weight loss in the first place. After I lost the weight and went into anorexia, I needed to do *even more* work here. Now that I'm recovered and things are starting to stabilize, I have more clarity about the fact that what led me to live at both ends of the spectrum at different times in my life was almost certainly down to things primarily in the psychological/emotional realm and secondarily in the biological/environmental realm, even I won't deny the latter plays a significant role. Deep down people of all shapes and sizes are slowly dying on the inside and yeah, Amberlynn Reid seems like a really shitty person on the surface, but there were some shitty things about me when I was obese, and there are some shitty things about me now. It's all an outward expression of inner pain. All I can say is these days I try to fight my human instincts to respond in anger/frustration/hatred which accomplishes nothing, and instead try to respond in love and empathy.",

I could not believe how easy it was to put on that much weight. I'm short so, it showed fast! I don't know everyone's situations and I know everyone's bodies are different. Medical issues and such. But anyone that is too big, I just automatically assume they ate themselves there. And I don't sympathize. Because at some point you have to decide enough is enough. Of course depression and rejection bring in a big part and ofcourse it would be easier to keep eating but no... At some point you have to prioritize and sacrifice. Losing weight is tough but I don't sympathize with the angry* overweight . I know, I'm such a bitch . :/",

There were sooo many threads that were just thinly-veiled excuses to talk about how gross they thought fat people were. It was so disappointing because those threads were rarer in the old sub, so it really felt like people were preying on the new sub to see what they could get away with, push boundaries, turn it into another \"fathate\" sub, etc.  \nI think it's doing a bit better now tho. Even on those threads there's always at least one comment speaking up for overweight people, and the new moderators are really good at being able to differentiate between someone sharing their honest experiences bc they need help even if those experiences are negative, and the people who are just using this sub as an excuse to be gross. Sometimes I definitely have to leave here tho or I come here looking for support and end up feeling even worse about myself, which - lol! - just triggers a binge, which is why I'm here in the first place, for my BED. \ud83d\ude43\n\nFWIW I hope you stay here for as long as it's still a usefull comm for you to be in. You and your struggles are valid and you deserve support. \ud83d\udc95",
