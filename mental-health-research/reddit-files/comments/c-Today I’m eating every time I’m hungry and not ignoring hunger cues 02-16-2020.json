                "Text": "Good for you! That's awesome that you were able to eat breakfast. The first day I ate breakfast in a really, really long time is when I consider my recovery to have truly began. It triggered a ton of changes in my body and mind throughout the course of the day and really started the recovery process. Just to warn you, though, be careful how much exercise you do. If you're used to working out a lot, your instinct will be to jump right back in because the extra food will give you lots of energy. But remember that your body's already under a ton of stress from the history of calorie restriction, and although I think going to the gym is beneficial during re-feeding just to direct your body on where to repair/strengthen itself, you don't want to create too much stress. You are more susceptible to Rhadbomyolysis and Hyponatremia right now. Three times a week is probably more than enough to start.",
