I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

                            "Text": "Yeah, exactly. I get that what he said doesn't really add more talking points to the thread, but his sentiment is important to understand. Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

He wasn\u2019t trying to pick up girls or convince people he\u2019s worthy or whatever that the stereotypical nice guy does. I\u2019m just trying to see it from his POV. And maybe it was the fact that he is a male on this subreddit and doesn\u2019t want anyone to think that he\u2019s lurking or commenting for gross reasons like the men mentioned in the original post. \n\nI hope I don\u2019t sound rude or belittling. I\u2019m just trying to not make assumptions about something because to me it seemed like a simple comment. Maybe a bit of a defensive one, but not one with any ill intent, you know? I just feel like sometimes people look way too much into things (I\u2019m guilty of it lmao) and get offended before actually trying to understand/talk/educate the other person. \n\nSorry I\u2019m rambling lol ",

                            "Text": "Yeah, exactly. I get that what he said doesn't really add more talking points to the thread, but his sentiment is important to understand. Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

I mean yeah I guess I can see how the comment doesn\u2019t add too much to the conversation I suppose but also the original comment was a generalized statement of a group of people, while I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant literally \u201call men\u201d. But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

And maybe it was the fact that he is a male on this subreddit and doesn\u2019t want anyone to think that he\u2019s lurking or commenting for gross reasons like the men mentioned in the original post. \n\nI hope I don\u2019t sound rude or belittling. I\u2019m just trying to not make assumptions about something because to me it seemed like a simple comment. Maybe a bit of a defensive one, but not one with any ill intent, you know? I just feel like sometimes people look way too much into things (I\u2019m guilty of it lmao) and get offended before actually trying to understand/talk/educate the other person. \n\nSorry I\u2019m rambling lol ",

                            "Text": "Yeah, exactly. I get that what he said doesn't really add more talking points to the thread, but his sentiment is important to understand. Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",

But I understand wanting to pop in and say that it isn\u2019t all men considering you\u2019re in an ED sub (and an actual male with an ED judging by the fact you have stats). Eating disorders are looked at as a stereotypically female illness so being a male with one probably means you constantly feel invalidated. This is supposed to be a safe space for everyone with EDs so I can see how you might be feeling left out or judged by reading the above comment. \n\nEdit: and just wanted to add that i think educating and disagreeing with you is totally okay if someone feels that strongly, but the amount of downvotes and tone of replies seemed to be edging on a bit hostile.

Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of \"stereotyping\" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these \"to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone\" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments. It seems like there is a bit of a double-standard because if a male here posted something along the lines of \"women just care about looks/abs\" or something like that, it wouldn't get even close to 30 upvotes. Remember that this is a tolerant safe space for **all kinds of people** suffering from EDs that also tend to go hand in hand with a plethora of other mental problems, most particularly, low self-esteem. It hurts to be singled-out no matter who you are. ",
