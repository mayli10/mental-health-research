If I could time travel I\u2019d tell that me to calm down and give her a giant hug. It seems so rational when it\u2019s happening but looking back I can see how completely underweight and starving and depressed I was. <3 my heart goes out to anyone feeling this way right now. I feel the tug of my old ED habits from time to time, as I have recently been working on getting in shape and getting into running again, trying not to get triggered. It doesn\u2019t go away, but it always gets better and can get manageable if you believe you can do it and put in the effort to get better! <3 let me know if anyone needs to talk !!",
