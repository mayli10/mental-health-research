                "Text": "Yeahhh, I got worse too, but for different reasons. Sometimes I act like a petulant child - the more someone tells me to do something, the less likely I am to actually do it. So when ProED and our memes got banned it was like, \"oh, ya gonna tell me to GeT HeLp or to StoP STaRviNg MySeLf?\" Well fuck you I do what I want.\n\n\n\n\n\nI drove 12hrs to see family and friends, just got in last night. One of my friends knows how bad my AN has been lately and literally texted me telling me to eat something 4 times. I had planned on eating a protein bar on the way, but ended up only eating a diet dr pepper because of my bullshit childishness haha.",

Honestly i don't have a clue what they were thinking \"ah yes, lets get rid of the support group for people struggling with a potentially life-threatening psychiatric disorder, *what could POSSIBLY go wrong?*\" I panicked and cried in the shower for three hours straight after i found out it was taken down. I had so many thoughts running through my head, an unsettling number of which were about suicide.\n\nI'm okay now (or, as okay as one can be while starving themselves :\\^)) but taking down proed was the dumbest, most harmful and ignorant decision they could've possibly made.
