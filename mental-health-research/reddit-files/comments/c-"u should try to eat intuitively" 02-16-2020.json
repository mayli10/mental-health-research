If no, you put away the leftovers. \n\nIt\u2019s a slow process, but you\u2019re also less likely to choke and overeat. I love it.\n\nSecond step for me is keeping a log of what I eat and writing how the food made me feel later that day (head ache, stomach ache, car sick, light headed, dizzy, crampy, slow, energetic, warm, cold, focused, ect.)\n\nAfter awhile, I can input that data and look for patterns. Hmm, every time my diet consists of mostly cereal and coffee I feel tired and lightheaded. Better stop doing that. Or, ah, every time I have mc donalds i get the shits. That\u2019s not right.",
