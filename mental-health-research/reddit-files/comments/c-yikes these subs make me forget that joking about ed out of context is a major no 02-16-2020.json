It's important for people to learn not to comment on others' weight or physical status unless the individual has brought it up and offered information themselves, and thus demonstrated their level of comfort with the subject. If the individual has brought it up and they've displayed a sense of humor about it, then it's fair game, sure! But to just comment on it out of nowhere is pretty inconsiderate and I think OP's reaction, delivered in a friendly/humorous way especially, is totally the right reaction to make people think twice and be more aware in their future interactions.",

Obviously that had me emotionally fucked up.\n\nAnyways so in the same week unmedicated me is walking around my college campus with my friends and we see this sorority stand with this big fuckin piece of paper. The girls say: \"Hi! :) Will you sign our banner to help end domestic abuse?? :)\" \n\nAnd my immediate answer is, \" Oh, I would, but apparently that doesn't help.\"\n\nIt took me a full 3 seconds to fully process what I said and I felt really bad but by that point we were too far away for me to turn back cause we were in a rush.\n\nMy friends thought it was really funny and now 2 years later I do too cause honestly they were just asking people to write their name on a giant piece of paper. Not a petition, and they weren't collecting money so wtf is that supposed to do for domestic abuse victims?",
