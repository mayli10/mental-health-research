It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

                        "Text": "I will yeild that I inversed that, fat floats and that is what is actually skimmed off. And modern milk is seperated in a centrifuge. I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

I think there have been cases of parents feeding their babies skim milk because of the \"low fat\" craze in the 80s/90s and it leads to malnutrition. \n\nAnd the \"added sugar\" comes from the lactose that they put back in, which is the part that I mainly misunderstood from your original comment. \n\nThey are not dumping bags of cane sugar into anyones milk is really all I wanted to make clear, which of course, you never actually claimed. \ud83d\ude33",

It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

Milk has % protein/carbs(sugar)/fat. If you remove a large portion of the fat the ratio gets skewed and the % change.\n\nThey do not add anything to skim milk.",

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

No milk is bad, but full fat milk is definitely better for people aged around mid twenties and under for development, also for the elderly.\n\nMilk solids aren't counted as other ingredients as they are milk, but the milk solids have a higher percentage of lactose compared to standard milk, which increases the overall amount of sugar in the end product.

They usually have additives to make it taste better, like milk powder and sugar (lactose), both of which are milk products so they don't have to label them as ingredients (which I think is stupid).

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

It's like claiming that crackers are healthy because they're not cookies, or cereal bars (all of them) are healthy because they're not chocolate bars. Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",

Anybody making these claims has never actually checked. \n\nMaybe? I also think a lot of people have been misled on the so-called dangers of sweeteners. I had someone tell me once that one of the ingredients in sweet and low is fatal when isolated and used it as an argument against sweeteners...nevermind that your body doesn't isolate that ingredient from the rest, or we'd all be dead right now...

I also want to say I miss read your inital comment and thought you were saying they added sugar in the form of cane sugar or \"added sugar\" because I've seen that claimed in bad articles. I've actually had this discussion in real life, so I do apologize for the misread. \n\nI also said they don't *add* things which isnt totally ture as the USDA requires milk to be fortified with certain vitamins.\n\nAdding powdered milk is not really adding anything. Powdered milk is milk. Processing food is not inherently bad. They break it down and then put it back together. I understand that this might be arguing semantics though.\n\nhttps://www.thekitchn.com/how-is-skim-milk-made-ingredient-intelligence-215893\n\nThats a good article that avoids making \"good\" vs \"bad\" or moralizing/emotional reasoning.  A lot of articles that I found try to make it seem like its more fattening or causes weight gain. Calories cause weight gain, not macros. And while there is data to show that a keto like diet can help with things like water weight that carbs cause, a high carb low fat is also a type of diet many people practice. \n\n\nI found a couple articles with your claim; that because it is powdered milk solids that is bad.  But most of them also had other wild claims. Their claim is something about the oxidized cholesterol that occurs durring the processing of the milk powder, however I need to read more about this. It mentions nitrates as well, which is a buzz word/topic I see a lot. From my research in the past I don't believe all the hype with nitrates, but I agree they should be limited to moderation.\n\nWow, I am apparently really passionate about milk.\n\nSome people like to drink whole milk, I drink 2% personally. I am supposed to practice a lower fat diet due to gastrointestinal issues, but I like a little more fat in my milk. I use 2% fage yogurt instead of fat free as well. There is no 1 size fits all diet. \n\nI feel like a crazy person ranting about milk.\n",
