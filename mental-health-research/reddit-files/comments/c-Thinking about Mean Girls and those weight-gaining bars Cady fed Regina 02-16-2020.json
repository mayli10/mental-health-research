She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

                            "Text": "ty \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI got blazed, tossed the idea out offline, and we've decided:\n\n- it starts out with the duo on the bottom of the social ladder, because whooo inverse symmetry with MG1\n\n- someone has to get slushied in a homage to season 1 Glee\n\n- Doesntevengohere's almost always that wholesome, emotional, and unironically passionate about everything. She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

                            "Text": "ty \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI got blazed, tossed the idea out offline, and we've decided:\n\n- it starts out with the duo on the bottom of the social ladder, because whooo inverse symmetry with MG1\n\n- someone has to get slushied in a homage to season 1 Glee\n\n- Doesntevengohere's almost always that wholesome, emotional, and unironically passionate about everything. She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She cries at fucking anything, and she's so honest that she's coded as naive. (Nah, she just deliberately chooses to be pleasant and friendly even towards assholes.) She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",

She could talk down a would-be mugger, reorient his life, hug it out, and walk away.\n\n- Nobody expects this to keep working. Everyone assumes she's going to be a bullying target at the start of the movie. She kinda is. Also, she doesn't even go here. How does she keep finding new ways to get in?\n\n- At the end, she finally gets to go to the school (maybe it was her goal all along?!) and makes friends with every single clique. She's a human golden retriever. The people-person to end all people-persons.\n\n- We're pretty sure Glen Coco never actually *gets* a pronoun, just valentines, and \"Glen Coco\" is so flashy+ambiguous. so now they're nonbinary\n\n- it gets played like Glen Coco's going to get bullied for that too\n\n- but oops, Glen Coco's actually pretty badass and takes exactly zero shit from anyone\n\n- Glen literally steps outside the social ladder, plows their own way, and ends up getting their acceptance n' glory as one of those kids from high school who somehow pull it off and make people say \"remember them? what a weird nerd...\" fondly, not douchebaggily\n\n- problem is, Glen actually *hates* attention, and spends the entire plot trying to avoid friends (oops, they end up liking people anyways!) and just be left alone\n\n- which is why they're never onscreen in MG1\n\n- and they only get on board with trying to fix the school chaos once it's clear that Cady + Regina's war is going to make it so they can't just quietly do their own damn thing\n\n- we find out who sent those four Valentines.\n\n- Glen and protag #2 are bros, but #2 kinda carries a torch for Regina throughout the movie.\n\n- Karen's boobs predict a tornado.\n\n- the principal has a past nobody has hitherto known about. That man has seen some shit. Public school doesn't cover it. I don't know how it's plot relevant, but it is.\n\n- the actor for Sue Sylvestre plays protag #2's villain mom, who's determined to force her kid to move away and go to another school, then goes maternally Basic Instinct on that endeavor.\n\n- At the end of the plot she's banned from the school, lets her kid choose to live with her dad and stay, and mom moves to Africa.\n\n- Glen Coco graduates, goes into corporate espionage, and makes a fortune\n\n- the ending scene is Cady and Janice talking about how fucked up movie #1 was. But Cady's in college, Janice's working, they're rooming together as non-dumbass kids, and it all turned out alright even after high school (which really doesn't matter in the end!)\n\n- okay, we're kinda just watching Glee now, rip\n\n- this idea has gotten out of control, but in a fun way",
