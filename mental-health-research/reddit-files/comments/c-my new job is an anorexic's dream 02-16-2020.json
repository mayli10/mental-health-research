It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance.

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance. Balance training is more important than people think in fitness, it\u2019s just good for your body to balance because it requires a lot of core work. And who doesn\u2019t want a strong core? Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

My job is private personal fitness trainer so during work hours Its either training a client, running a boot camp class, doing nutrition consultations/nutrition sessions, or putting together programs for clients. Sometimes meal prepping sessions where the client and I will spend the hour session in the kitchen meal prepping. With one of my clients we\u2019ll choose a menu for the week and I prep her five days of lunches/dinners. And then I have my own program so I do three days per week one hour weight training sessions, kickboxing 1-2x per week, surfset fitness classes 1-2x per week, and then I nanny a very active four year old a few evening/nights per week. I think I\u2019d choose personal fitness training over chef work any day. I meal prep most of my own food plus the 1-2 additional hours every Sunday that I prep for one of my clients food so for me that\u2019s enough kitchen time \ud83d\ude02  \nI only get $18-22/hour for nannying but personal training 1:1 clients will pay $50-$80 an hour and with this being Los Angeles everyone wants a nice body and seems to feel the need to have a trainer to get them one. \nBtw: anyone who wants to get extra exercising in without it feeling grueling and  \u201cI\u2019m only doing this for the calories and the Ed voice\u201d  try surfset fitness and kickboxing, rock climbing is also a fun one. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c",

So I don\u2019t fit neatly into one diagnosis \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI count calories and macros like my life depends on it and practically die if one calorie slips through without being accurately weighed and accounted for. I\u2019m a mental case with eating, weight, body image yet all these people look up to me and tell me my body is \u201cgoals\u201d for them \ud83d\ude23",

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance.

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",

It\u2019s workouts done on a surfboard attached but not fully secured to the ground which makes the workout all the more fun and efficient at challenging your balance.

Although you can build a great core and have the abs though, it won\u2019t be visible unless you cut the excess body fat which means dialing down on nutrition. \nOne of the  gyms I go to is in a giant indoor sandbox, it\u2019s called sandbox fitness, they have surfset classes among other ones like trx,  barre, and bootcamp",
