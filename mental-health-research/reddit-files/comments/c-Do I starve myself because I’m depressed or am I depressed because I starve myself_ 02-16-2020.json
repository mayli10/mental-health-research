There are of course still other psychological factors and learned behaviors at play in any disorder. But all kinds of things can also help regulate serotonin appropriately - and of course starving is not a very adaptive way to do that anyway! Many other medications and things can help mediate your serotonin levels, even if indirectly, so you could still be affected but have just found a much healthier way to manage it without restricting.",

Many other medications and things can help mediate your serotonin levels, even if indirectly, so you could still be affected but have just found a much healthier way to manage it without restricting.",

And I'll reiterate that this model is not applicable to all with AN, but it is an eye opening area of research for those that may be experiencing it. The model can explain the powerful \"calming\" or numbing effect restriction can have (short term obviously) for some. It also validates the increased distress and anxiety felt during refeeding and recovery.",

There are of course still other psychological factors and learned behaviors at play in any disorder. But all kinds of things can also help regulate serotonin appropriately - and of course starving is not a very adaptive way to do that anyway! Many other medications and things can help mediate your serotonin levels, even if indirectly, so you could still be affected but have just found a much healthier way to manage it without restricting.",

There are of course still other psychological factors and learned behaviors at play in any disorder. But all kinds of things can also help regulate serotonin appropriately - and of course starving is not a very adaptive way to do that anyway! Many other medications and things can help mediate your serotonin levels, even if indirectly, so you could still be affected but have just found a much healthier way to manage it without restricting.",

There are of course still other psychological factors and learned behaviors at play in any disorder. But all kinds of things can also help regulate serotonin appropriately - and of course starving is not a very adaptive way to do that anyway! Many other medications and things can help mediate your serotonin levels, even if indirectly, so you could still be affected but have just found a much healthier way to manage it without restricting.",

There are of course still other psychological factors and learned behaviors at play in any disorder. But all kinds of things can also help regulate serotonin appropriately - and of course starving is not a very adaptive way to do that anyway! Many other medications and things can help mediate your serotonin levels, even if indirectly, so you could still be affected but have just found a much healthier way to manage it without restricting.",

                    "Text": "Have you ever read about the serotonin model of anorexia? I read about it in grad school. The short version is that some studies have found evidence that there is a population of anorexics who naturally have uncomfortably elevated levels of serotonin, and the restriction (particularly of foods with tryptophan, the precursor to serotonin) is a way to down regulate serotonin and reduces anxiety and stress. Really interesting stuff. Also seems to explain why SSRIs can be counterproductive for some, exacerbating anxiety.  \n\nSorry for a little rant, but I'm always looking for people to discuss it with! It seems relatively under the radar as far as biological models go.",

The model can explain the powerful \"calming\" or numbing effect restriction can have (short term obviously) for some.

And I'll reiterate that this model is not applicable to all with AN, but it is an eye opening area of research for those that may be experiencing it. The model can explain the powerful \"calming\" or numbing effect restriction can have (short term obviously) for some. It also validates the increased distress and anxiety felt during refeeding and recovery.",

I woke up once out of a dead sleep having a panic attack when I was on one. \n\nAlso, when you\u2019re starving your mind is hyper focused on one thing - in my case it was \u201cnot eating\u201d and sort of playing a game as to how I can lie (but not really lie) to others to keep from having to eat around them - so I found that I never had any mental capacity to worry about other issues in my life. Not a good way to live. My world was incredibly small.",

No one healthy chooses to regularly starve themselves or b/p. For me, I was coping (poorly) with PTSD. The anorexia is a symptom, but regardless of the cause it\u2019s still an eating disorder.",
