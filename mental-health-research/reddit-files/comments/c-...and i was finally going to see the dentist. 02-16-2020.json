The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\" -Teddy Roosevelt\n\nDare greatly, my friend!

                "Text": "Hey idk if this is okay to say, or if it will help, but the amazing folks in the stopdrinking subreddit are often responding to people talking about their relapses. Obviously it\u2019s not the same situation for you, but there are a lot of similar posts over there and maybe something will click for you in the way they explain that a relapse is not your fault. I don\u2019t really have the words of wisdom you need to hear right now, but I would definitely go read some stuff over there, if you\u2019re interested. It\u2019s an amazing resource, just thought I\u2019d mention in case it\u2019s at all relatable or helpful to you. (Keep in mind, a lot of the people there have a lot of experience with relapses, and a lot of them have come out the other side, and stayed there for a very long time). Strength and love to you hon, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re suffering. Hang in there, we care and we\u2019ve got your back.\n\nedit: maybe I should say that the only reason I\u2019m suggesting looking outside this subreddit is because this sub is still so new, there aren\u2019t years and years of posts to look back on. Not trying to discredit the comments of this community, just help OP find more resources to lean on. ",

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\" -Teddy Roosevelt\n\nDare greatly, my friend!

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\" -Teddy Roosevelt\n\nDare greatly, my friend!
