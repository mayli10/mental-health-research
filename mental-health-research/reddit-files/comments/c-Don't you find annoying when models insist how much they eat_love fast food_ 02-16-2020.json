I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

I also ran a lot at that time 5 days a week roughly 50 miles a week. I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

My body stops fighting me at that point and is less prone to bonking. \n\nOn the other hand, though, being 1) extremely active and 2) not used to junk food means I seldom actually want anything other but \"bananas, protein shake, sweet potato and broccoli\" lol. My allotted \"empty calories\" tend to go to beer. And not much of it, since I only drink the good stuff. :p",

I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

She was a 4'8 Asian woman with shoulders that *might* have looked natural on a 6' man.\n\nThe only thing I judged her for was her constant and unsolicited denial XD",

I also ran a lot at that time 5 days a week roughly 50 miles a week. I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot.

I also ran a lot at that time 5 days a week roughly 50 miles a week. I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

My body stops fighting me at that point and is less prone to bonking. \n\nOn the other hand, though, being 1) extremely active and 2) not used to junk food means I seldom actually want anything other but \"bananas, protein shake, sweet potato and broccoli\" lol. My allotted \"empty calories\" tend to go to beer. And not much of it, since I only drink the good stuff. :p",

She always posts rainbows and butterflies pro-recovery stuff on Facebook then the same day she\u2019ll text me and be like \u201cI just went to the ER because I passed out lol\u201d.

I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

                "Text": "I actually do believe that some of them eat like that, at least some of the time. Models are generally 5\u20198-5\u201911, sometimes taller, and intensely working out is part of their job, so the calories they\u2019re burning on a daily basis are enough to accommodate a pizza, especially if they\u2019re eating low calorie/healthy food the rest of the day.  Of course I don\u2019t think they do that before fashion week or a big shoot, and of course a lot of them do have ED problems, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily an outright lie. I do think that the more a person tries to convince you that they totally eat, the more of a lie it probably is, though.",

My body stops fighting me at that point and is less prone to bonking. \n\nOn the other hand, though, being 1) extremely active and 2) not used to junk food means I seldom actually want anything other but \"bananas, protein shake, sweet potato and broccoli\" lol. My allotted \"empty calories\" tend to go to beer. And not much of it, since I only drink the good stuff. :p",

I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot.

My body stops fighting me at that point and is less prone to bonking. \n\nOn the other hand, though, being 1) extremely active and 2) not used to junk food means I seldom actually want anything other but \"bananas, protein shake, sweet potato and broccoli\" lol. My allotted \"empty calories\" tend to go to beer. And not much of it, since I only drink the good stuff. :p",

I also ran a lot at that time 5 days a week roughly 50 miles a week. I never had my bmr actually tested but I was drowning a six pack or bottle of wine and eating the equivalent of a half large pizza almost every single night I had off and the rest of the time keeping my calories around 2000 a day still lost one or 2 lbs every week. Your metabolism slowing down from not eating/being sedentary is real. P.s. not trying to preach I definitely decided I wanted to lose weight faster and cut cals a lot. It wasn't pretty and I had to give up running and the job. I have bouts of ED. I'll be fine for awhile then all of a sudden ED is back.",

My body stops fighting me at that point and is less prone to bonking. \n\nOn the other hand, though, being 1) extremely active and 2) not used to junk food means I seldom actually want anything other but \"bananas, protein shake, sweet potato and broccoli\" lol. My allotted \"empty calories\" tend to go to beer. And not much of it, since I only drink the good stuff. :p",
