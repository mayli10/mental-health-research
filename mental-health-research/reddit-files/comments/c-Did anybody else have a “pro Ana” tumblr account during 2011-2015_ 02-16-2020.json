The reality is, I find some value in my ED. For one, as bad a coping mechanism as it is, sometimes it's the only thing that keeps me upright and safe. It's reliable, is the thing. Sometimes meds work. Sometimes therapeutic techniques work. Not eating? Unfortunately, that always works.\n\nWe can talk openly here, too, but there were voices on tumblr I still miss.",
