And one of the most dangerous aspects of fasting on the mentality of someone at risk of or with a history of an eating disorder is the negative association of food. It turns eating from what, at best, is a neutral act to something that wracks you with guilt if you do it at the self-imposed \"wrong\" time. Of course your relationship with food is arguably better than it used to be, right? But the emotional relationship fasting CAN create from nothing (though I guess you already know what it's like to feel worse about food than this) is nonetheless something that seems to happen too often",
