But I had a fucking *breakdown* because it was HUGE. The dude literally piled it on my plate, and I ate it all.\n\nIt was like 500 calories and I try to stick to 1000 or under, but the sheer volume had me freaked out. It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",

But I had a fucking *breakdown* because it was HUGE. The dude literally piled it on my plate, and I ate it all.\n\nIt was like 500 calories and I try to stick to 1000 or under, but the sheer volume had me freaked out. It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",

It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",

It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",

But I had a fucking *breakdown* because it was HUGE. The dude literally piled it on my plate, and I ate it all.\n\nIt was like 500 calories and I try to stick to 1000 or under, but the sheer volume had me freaked out. It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",

It\u2019s so weird how our brains fixated on random numbers and make these nonsensical rules specific to each person.\n\nBut it also depends. Like currently I\u2019ve decided 300 a day is my goal, so if I eat 500 I\u2019d consider it a disgusting binge. But then last month I was on 700 a day, so 500 was considered a good day. Lmao my brain pisses me off.\n\nBut never going over 800 is like my one constant rule - so if I break it, it\u2019s meltdown time.",

The dude literally piled it on my plate, and I ate it all.\n\nIt was like 500 calories and I try to stick to 1000 or under, but the sheer volume had me freaked out. It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",

But I had a fucking *breakdown* because it was HUGE. The dude literally piled it on my plate, and I ate it all.\n\nIt was like 500 calories and I try to stick to 1000 or under, but the sheer volume had me freaked out. It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",

Like to me eating less than 1000 calories a day is perfectly normal but in reality we should be eating around 2000 and whenever I hear this I'm like what?! Ate you insane. It's just funny to me how our ed's make new norms for us. But when you ask someone else it's not normal",

I'm not hungry either, which is weird. \n\nI'm constantly going to the bathroom a couple hours later and my stomach hurts.\n\nI'm gonna stop eating out of fear cause my stomach really hurts. \n\nI tried cereal today and I could only finish 3 bites before my stomach felt so full it was going to explode. \n\n\nI'm still 35 lbs overweight.

But I had a fucking *breakdown* because it was HUGE. The dude literally piled it on my plate, and I ate it all.\n\nIt was like 500 calories and I try to stick to 1000 or under, but the sheer volume had me freaked out. It felt like I'd binged and the little depression demon in my head was throwing a tantrum.\n\nThe holidays are wack for my eating habits lmao",
