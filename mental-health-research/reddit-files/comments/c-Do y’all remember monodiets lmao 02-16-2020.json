Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

                        "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

                            "Text": "I'm sorry, but this is not exactly accurate.\n\n**Disclaimer: I don't think it is healthy to eat carrot monos.**\n\nVitamin A comes in two forms, beta carotene (in plant foods) and retinol (in animal foods). Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

I just knew the orange skin thing. \n\nso according to the Google, 100g of carrot has 16706 iu of vitamin a.\n\naccording to several medical pages I just visited on the subject, regularly consuming over 25000iu per day can result in chronic vitamin a poisoning. that's only 150g of carrots. I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

I just knew the orange skin thing. \n\nso according to the Google, 100g of carrot has 16706 iu of vitamin a.\n\naccording to several medical pages I just visited on the subject, regularly consuming over 25000iu per day can result in chronic vitamin a poisoning. that's only 150g of carrots. I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

I just knew the orange skin thing. \n\nso according to the Google, 100g of carrot has 16706 iu of vitamin a.\n\naccording to several medical pages I just visited on the subject, regularly consuming over 25000iu per day can result in chronic vitamin a poisoning. that's only 150g of carrots. I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal.

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

You could show people a picture of her back and one of her legs and people would say that it's two different people. She's very pale but tans so easily. She can add 3 shades after just being at a theme park for 1 day.\n\n\nOh yeah, I did for sure. I only recently started exfoliating in the shower and using body lotion each time. I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

You could show people a picture of her back and one of her legs and people would say that it's two different people. She's very pale but tans so easily. She can add 3 shades after just being at a theme park for 1 day.\n\n\nOh yeah, I did for sure. I only recently started exfoliating in the shower and using body lotion each time. I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

                        "Text": "I'm sorry, but this is not exactly accurate.\n\n**Disclaimer: I don't think it is healthy to eat carrot monos.**\n\nVitamin A comes in two forms, beta carotene (in plant foods) and retinol (in animal foods). Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

You could show people a picture of her back and one of her legs and people would say that it's two different people. She's very pale but tans so easily. She can add 3 shades after just being at a theme park for 1 day.\n\n\nOh yeah, I did for sure. I only recently started exfoliating in the shower and using body lotion each time. I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

She can add 3 shades after just being at a theme park for 1 day.\n\n\nOh yeah, I did for sure. I only recently started exfoliating in the shower and using body lotion each time. I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller. I hope that makes sense. \ud83d\ude02 It for sure sounds like a lot of work, but I swear all together it takes maybe 10 minutes a day of rubbing stuff on the face and neck. :)",

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal.

You could show people a picture of her back and one of her legs and people would say that it's two different people. She's very pale but tans so easily.

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller. I hope that makes sense. \ud83d\ude02 It for sure sounds like a lot of work, but I swear all together it takes maybe 10 minutes a day of rubbing stuff on the face and neck. :)",

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

I just knew the orange skin thing. \n\nso according to the Google, 100g of carrot has 16706 iu of vitamin a.\n\naccording to several medical pages I just visited on the subject, regularly consuming over 25000iu per day can result in chronic vitamin a poisoning. that's only 150g of carrots. I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!!

I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Although I probably should take better care of my skin.\n\nYou want one that protects against both UVA and UVB. \"50 level\" aka \"50 SPF\" just measures how well it protects against UVB, but UVA is the \"tanning radiation\". Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal.

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal.

I just knew the orange skin thing. \n\nso according to the Google, 100g of carrot has 16706 iu of vitamin a.\n\naccording to several medical pages I just visited on the subject, regularly consuming over 25000iu per day can result in chronic vitamin a poisoning. that's only 150g of carrots. I usually eat 200g+ a day.\n\nacute vitaminosis is caused by eating \"several hundred thousand units (iu)\", so, like if that's 300,000iu, that would be 1.8kg of carrots. that's 744 calories worth of carrots.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",

                            "Text": "I understand totally. It is never a bad thing! But since you want to lighten your skin tone, I have some tips if you want them. I stay indoors and cover up when outside with pants/leggings, a hat, and a light cardigan. I use a silicon-based moisturizer and 50+ SPF CC cream on my face every day and the Neutrogena oil-free acne moisturizer every night. I use Bioelements Quick Refiner (leave on exfoliator, $35.70) at night because it brightens my face with acids and also will make my skin sensitive to sunlight and tan easier so putting it on before bed it essential. I used to have a deep tan that really blended with my dark brown hair, but now I am very light porcelain. It's hard to find my shade as hard as it is to find very dark shades (lookin at you, Revlon). Ngl, it took literal years to get as light as I am, but it is the safest way to lighten a skin tone without bleach or harmful chemicals. Being a nerd also helps. Oh and I also exfoliate in the shower every day and use a body oil or shea butter lotion after my showers.\n\n\n\nBTW I'm not sponsored or endorsed!! Just the products that worked for me and are also inexpensive and work for all skin types.",

                        "Text": "I'm sorry, but this is not exactly accurate.\n\n**Disclaimer: I don't think it is healthy to eat carrot monos.**\n\nVitamin A comes in two forms, beta carotene (in plant foods) and retinol (in animal foods). Hypervitaminosis A is only caused by overconsumption of retinol. Overconsumption of beta carotene will only lead to carotenosis, causing the orangey skin from eating too many carrots, and it is not fatal. However, hypervitaminosis A is very dangerous.\n\nWhy is it this way? It's because beta carotene must be converted by the body into the active form, retinol, and the conversion rate is regulated by your body.",

I didn't do that and I still got my complexion as light as it is, but the shower routine makes me skin glow and look less, well, like I had been a basement dweller.

Look for a sunscreen with \"broad spectrum protection\" or a physical sunblock (like a mineral one).",
