It can happen at any age. I've seen it in the younger and the older. And oh God, I wish I were just pretending. I wish it were a dream and I could wake up. My mother suffered from an ED and I always thought she could just stop if she wanted to. It angered me that she put her bulimia before her children and made me feel like a pig constantly. Now here I am, following in her footsteps, knowing that it could kill me everytime i put my fingers down my throat. Does it stop me? Fuck no. I wish this were a dream, that I could be \"pretending.\" \n\nI don't mean to come across as rude but this isn't a fantasy. No one should make you feel like anything you do is a hoax. Especially anything with mental illness.  This shit fucks with your head, man. It's not tea parties and pillow fights. If you believe you have an ED then 9/10 times, no matter how young or old YOU are, boy or girl, then you have an ED. No need to pretend about something so dangerous. ",
