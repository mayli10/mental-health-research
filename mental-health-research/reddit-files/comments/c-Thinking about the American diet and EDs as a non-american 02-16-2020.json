                "Text": ">THE AMOUNT OF SALT AND SUGAR IS INSANE! They are completely twisting off your taste buds and creating addictive shit \n\nEvery time I try and talk to my American friends about food I feel like they just don't get this. I'm from Aus and we like sugar and salt in our food as much as the next obese country but LORD, the US is on a whole other level. Like, you guys have sugar in your *bread*. That's... that's really not supposed to be in there. I promise you. And I feel so bad because it's HARD to switch back! Once you're used to food that's loaded with sugar and salt, if you go back to \"normal\" (or even above-average) levels of sweetness, it tastes bland! Sure, you adjust, but in the meantime you have to deal with eating bland and boring food. Not easy, especially if you use food as a coping mechanism.\n\nBut sweeter and saltier foods are more appealing to our monkey brains so it's more lucrative, health impact be damned : /\n\nI visited America and Canada when I was younger and on top of portion sizes, food expectations in general just... blew me away. I remember the family we were staying with bringing out a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts for breakfast and my fat little self was STUNNED and figured it must be a really really special occasion but... no... it was just breakfast. Like they didn't get why I was surprised, nor did they dissuade me from eating more than one. Aus food culture is pretty poor but I can't imagine living in a country where that's just... how food is presented to you, and then you're demonized if you over-eat and gain weight.\n\nAdd on top of that how nutritional info is so heavily obscured and easily manipulated by corporations in the US compared to other countries... like. I can't stand people making obesity into some kind of personal failing when the cards are all stacked against them there. It'd be like making fun of drug addicts if all the food in the country was literally spiked with drugs, the people with addictive personalities would be more susceptible??\n\nI wish European nutritional standards were adopted here and in the states :(",

I never really considered other countries didn\u2019t put so much sugar and salt in their foods. It makes sense, but I just never really thought about it. I\u2019ve never really had fresh baked bread that wasn\u2019t loaded with sugar so I have no idea what it\u2019d taste like. No wonder I\u2019m so addicted to food tho, everything we have is just sugary processed garbage :/",

                "Text": "I'm not gonna comment on the psychological complexity of eating disorders in different cultural contexts because it can't be oversimplified through just the desire to be thin without considering the deeper ramifications such as desire for control and history of abuse--especially sexual--as well as comorbid psychological disorders such as OCD that would really emphasize the desire to be the best.\n\nI have grown up in three different westernized developed countries, and from there have migrated extensively through each.  \n\nThe first thing I noticed about the U.S. was exactly that--the food was disgustingly, overtly salty and sweet compared to the same brands in other countries.\n\nIt's horrifying to think this is fed to the general public as normal staples. The food industry is poisoning us.\n\n With that in consideration, one might be able to picture why American culture would nuance an eating disorder as one of thinness--it's far easier to acknowledge a physical symptom when you have something you can physically blame, rather than turn towards your own social and environmental influences, and genetic, risk, and protective factors that could have exacerbated a mental illness.\n\nEdit: for better grammar and more accurate description.",

If you haven't, don't read it until you have a healthy and balanced mindset. She offers an excellent American feminist critique of Western diet and body image ideals in relation to culture interwoven with memoir. \n\nShe described her own eating disorders, specifically her lapse into anorexia, as \"a fanatical belief in the moral superiority of self-discipline and self-control.\"\n\nDeviating from the norm of overeating, indulging in supersized portions, and associating food with socialization appears to many as a morally superior option. To abstain as much as possible from eating and engaging in overexercise is a common way of attempting to avoid negative emotions with the ultimate display of self-discipline and self-control.",

My friend went to America for a 3 week trip, came back and told me horrified that she only ate raw foods, because that was the only thing that didn't taste like sugar and salt. I was curious and had my American friend ship me some damn bread lol (in return she received the famous Danish ryebread, which she thought was tasteless and hard as rocks). The white bread was literally cake. She told me this is the bread that all her sandwiches for lunch when she was a kid was made from. I was horrified. American white bread tastes exactly like what we call \"sand cake\". I feel bad for Americans that their government lets companies poison them and then other companies make money off of treating the diseases it causes. America is a dystopian nightmare.",

One of my friends in particular is taller (6\"2) and went from 86kg to 73kg as a consequence of moving, but then back up to 83kg after returning to the States for 3 months.

                "Text": "It's too bad our dumb hunter gatherer brains evolved to like sugar and salt so much because they're about two of the worst things you can have when you get too much of them. And not only do marketers know that sugar and salt make foods addictive, but the sodium is used to increase shelf-life so they have an excuse to load things up with salt.\n\nAnd you're right about healthy foods being even more expensive. I recently thought to myself that I needed to stop eating fast food so much now that my ADHD is being treated and it should be easier to make time to cook for myself or even just to remember to do it before I get way too tired from getting distracted then not eating. I bought enough for maybe 500 calories a day for 3 or 4 days and paid like $50. I can go to McDonald's and get a value menu combo for like $6 and that's around 900 calories. So 4 days would only be $24 instead. Plus, after the supplements I take a McDouble combo meets pretty much all of my nutritional needs for a day. I try to spend just $10 a day on food, so if I could bring myself to eat at McDonald's every day that would leave me with $4 which I could spend on protein bars or croissants or something. I can buy proteins bars at my college for $3 each and croissants at this store next to my house for 50 cents each, so I could get enough food to be healthy if I did that all the time. Well, croissants still aren't the best idea, but if I include the meal replacement shakes I drink that would still be about $10 and a lot healthier. I guess I wouldn't be getting quite enough calories to maintain a healthy weight, but I'm kind of over that anyway. I do think that would technically be about $10.50 and I might still buy a croissant anyway if I get hungry and want a snack, but even if I spend $11 on food for a day that's still better than $16.\n\nI kind of forgot I had Reddit open on my laptop and spent the past few hours browsing Reddit on my phone before I noticed I left this open and now I don't remember what I was talking about, so I guess I'll just hit send and leave it here.",

I live in Scandiavia, in the capital city in one of the Nordic Countries and I sometimes wonder how it's different to have an ED here vs. USA or elsewhere. We have really healthy food choices everywhere compared to the USA for example, and most people are really health conscious and workout a lot... Which is good but can also just fuel ED symtoms and make it easier to hide them. Also the city is full of women who look like supermodels and I find that the thin ideal is even more distorted than in the USA. There are very few overweight people and I can't remember ever seeing anyone obese, there is really little body diversity. It definitely makes having en ED harder.",

In Britain, bread is plain or it tastes buttery, but never sugary. In France, the bread is rich and dense and wholesome, there\u2019s no funny business, and I feel satisfied with a small portion.\n\nI want to work in America for a while because there are so many cool things there, but I think my ED brain will go so crazy.",

                "Text": "Oh mh god The comment on the salt and sugar and stuff in food here is CRAZY. Im always confused by some foods heres content. Why is there so much sugar in bread? Like plain bread why is it so processed it should just be regular bread but its got so much extra stuff added in it. Ive always have a very plain tongue with some foods i like salt and sugar but i like it very mildly flavored that way, but everything here is so...insane. I love me some bubble tea but the standard 100% sugar is completely disgusting to me. I would go for the 0% even without the ed bc milk and flavor is already sweet enough. Processed foods are too much for me. The flavor of doritos baffled me the first time i had one. I just prefer spicy or spiced foods or middle eastern (my origins) foods since it tastes so good and natural to me. Why do people eat like that?",

Even less expensive grocery stores have a lot of healthy and natural food. You can find rye and sprouted grains breads at many grocery stores though I don\u2019t believe they are as popular as white or the sweetened wheat bread because they are usually more expensive. You can also get pretty healthy prepackaged low calorie foods but they are usually more expensive. There is a huge variety of options but you probably won\u2019t find those options easily in some areas of the country.\n\n It\u2019s just that a lot of people choose to eat junk anyway because dieting is kind of looked down upon by many. I think it\u2019s definitely mocked as being vain or overly virtuous by people who choose not to do it. The whole body positivity movement is tied in with that. However it\u2019s still clear that being thinner or fitter is definitely considered better looking, so you have a lot of conflicting messages. Fortunately, where I live, I think most people my age make an effort to eat healthy so it\u2019s a lot easier to diet than it is in other parts of the country.",
