The girls are all ultra slim (with some of them having disproportionately large breasts) despite some having enormous appetites, e.g. Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon. Meanwhile, the men tends to also be very slim, yet their strength is greater than someone 3x their size, e.g. Cloud Strife from FFVII/Advent Children.\n\nI recall that I used to want to be like those guys only to realize later on that it's impossible. Not only is their strength impossible to achieve with their appearance, but I can't even achieve it using their training method (which would result in extreme body injuries in real life).",

Like I know most modern anime is aimed at the NEET cash cows and cash cows are interested in fuckin lolicon whatever but it feels like as fashion trends have just gotten skinnier and skinnier, anime girls have gotten skinnier too when they were already perfect :( They don't have any shape any more.

Came here to say Sailor Moon. 90s anime girls in general are such goals because they're thin without looking crazy like modern anime girls (especially the lolicon bait \ud83d\ude44) and they just look so soft and effortless and nice. It's like, I know I can literally never look like them because they're a cartoon, they're not real, but I want to look the way they feel, you know?\n\nEspecially because Sailor Moon was so stylish and I never thought I would look good in the kind of clothes they wear. Fitting into Sailor Moon clothes is one of my biggest motivators atm.",

                "Text": "Yall have to remember that anime character designs are meant to be artistically appealing for the sake of commercialization. It is legit the definition of unreachable beauty standards; usually the people are kids/pre-teens/perfect genetic teens and the anime industry propagating stereotypical character designs with no regards to realistic expectations. \n\nYou cannot compare yourself to an anime; it's dismissing the role of what the anime is supposed to do. (Entertain and provide escapism.)\n\nAnd as much as you might yearn for having the figure of a legit drawing that doesn't account for actual sustainable living; anime characters can care about their weight/other things too. \n\nidk how much of you guys are weebs but gaining weight and needing to diet and being insecure about their body is pretty relevant to female characters in various anime. Asian culture and their views on weight highly perpetuate beauty standards so you're not alone in feeling like you do- even about anime. It's much more toxic (from what I understand) in Asian countries where even anime propels people to yearn for that \"ideal\" figure. It's pretty depressing how many people pick up plastic surgery/etc because society makes them feel like they have to. Very superficial.\n\nA quick google search shows some interesting articles/discussion on the same thing.\n\nIt's easy to feel the way you guys do; but I think a lot of people here would feel better if you removed yourself from the equation and treated your entertainment separate from yourself. Don't create your own struggles, there is no intent to make you feel bad about yourself. It's hard to know your own self-worth but I'm sure you guys are wonderful. Do your best, and try to enjoy anime/tings/your escapist things without comparing yourself to whatever.",

You're right in a lot of ways.\n\nI've seen some of the things you said were even echoed by manga/anime creators -- particularly in changing their works to better appeal to the mainstream, e.g. Akira Toriyama (Dragonball) and Naoko Takeuchi (Sailor Moon).\n\nJapan (and Asia in general, really) has a very toxic culture regarding personal appearance. It is often said the west is bad with this, but, if what I've read is true, Japan is vastly worse. From my personal experience (visits to Asia), it certainly seems true too.\n\nAll in all, even knowing this, it's still difficult to stop one from feeling the effect, especially if you love anime/manga and experience it consistently.",
