I offer other people my drinks to make sure it's not just me, but the immediate flavor of ass usually makes it clear.\n\nI've been tempted to say I'm diabetic during the \"uh, can you switch this drink to my actual request?\" just to be like...seriously, guys, this could be a serious mistake.\n\nBecause it could!

I offer other people my drinks to make sure it's not just me, but the immediate flavor of ass usually makes it clear.\n\nI've been tempted to say I'm diabetic during the \"uh, can you switch this drink to my actual request?\" just to be like...seriously, guys, this could be a serious mistake.\n\nBecause it could!
