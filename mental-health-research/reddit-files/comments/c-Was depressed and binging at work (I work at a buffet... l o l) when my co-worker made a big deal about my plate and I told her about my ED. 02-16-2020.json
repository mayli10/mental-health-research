I remember years ago when I had rapidly lost about 60 pounds, and it went from healthy to extreme, where I'd exercise at least 8 hours straight each day and eat less than 500 calories. My mom has always been very, very concerned with everyone's weight. She's never been overtly cruel, but I was chubby in high school, and she often made little comments that she believed weren't hurtful. I was afraid to tell her what was going on with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually I collapsed after a work out, and I decided to tell my mom that I was worried I'd developed an eating disorder after two months of this behavior getting worse and worse. Her response? \"But I see you eat all the time.\" Said very snidely and defensively. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, even though in this case I was referring to anorexia and a form of bulimia, are people really that ignorant about eating disorders? They think only anorexia exists? It's so simplistic and obtuse. I wish I'd never told her.",

I remember being really ignorant as a teenager to almost EVERYTHING and I surely said something stupid the first time I heard about anything outside of my own experience.  When things were explained to me I understood and cared pretty quickly.  Now that I developed an ED (BED), I can't believe still how powerful the urges are... it's crazytown.  It has helped me understand a lot of people who are their fighting demons that are destructive.  I am SO sorry you didn't get any emotional support from her.  I wish I had some GREAT support to give you now.  I'll tell you this, I really understand!  I bet we all do!  Good luck to you.  I had candy for breakfast :)",
