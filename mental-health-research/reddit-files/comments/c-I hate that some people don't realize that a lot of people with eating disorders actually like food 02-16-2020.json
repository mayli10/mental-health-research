I get annoyed every time I have to eat and usually have to force myself to eat one meal a day. I flinch in disgust when I smell or see it. I fast for at least 24 hours before I can allow myself to eat, and that doesn't help my hunger much. Food is just disgusting. I don't know if my depression is contributing to my lack of appetite, but I can't stop thinking about my weight and the mere thought of food makes me angry.
