Like thanks for making me feel like even more of a lard ass. Then the fucking nerve he has.. trying to order me to eat. Like who the fuck do you think you're talking to? Don't tell me what to do. Idc if he thinks it's a joke. Telling me to \"go eat a sandwich\" has the opposite effect. I'm gonna restrict even more. Telling me you're gonna take me to a buffet is just gonna ruin what ever trust I have for you. Don't make stupid ass comments. Not about my body. Not about what I eat or don't eat. Just don't. Ever.

He would just do the *sigh* stop, you're not fat *eye roll* but he even stopped that after a while. He does once in a while squeeze me and call me sexy, but it only bothers me if he does it if I just ate. If I'm fasting I just ignore it and say thank you. Hes very supportive and compassionate about others feelings. Hes the best.",
