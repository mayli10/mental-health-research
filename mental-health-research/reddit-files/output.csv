For context, my dad gets me a 'Grande Cafe Misto with Almond Milk and SF Caramel' (48 kcal and lovely) pretty much every single day, since it's like.. My one source of comfort during the day. The local drive through SBs has gotten it wrong on occasion, leading to a lot of tears etc.

A few months ago, he explained to the woman whilst waiting that I had pretty severe AN, hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect, otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me. She sympathised and said she'd watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder, but thankfully she hasn't spiraled too far.

Anyway, now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart, and why it has to be so specific. He was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink, who know how & why, because they don't want to upset me and want to make sure it's always correct. He came home and had the above message written on my cup, and it just really made my day. It was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are, and understanding.

Sorry for the ramble, I just have nobody to share this with and I found it really sweet üòû

**Edit:** Thank you everyone, I forwarded on the comments to my dad & will also write to SB to name the branch & hopefully they'll get some worthy praise <3

Also, my dad has been incredible. He has Asperger's, but the lengths he goes to to empathize with me is something I'll always be thankful for - sadly we've both had to go through this disordered journey over the past year or so, but he's very supportive.

When I was fat a  ‚Äúfriend‚Äù jiggled my double chin and said if I just lost weight I could be pretty. She told me my chubby cheeks made me look like a squirrel when I smiled. It took me a long time to learn to love my smile again after that. 

When I was fat my dad asked me where he went wrong as a parent. How could my brother be so athletic while I ballooned each year in this household where carbs were practically a reincarnation of the devil himself? When he found the empty ice cream containers and chocolate wrappers he told me I was disgusting. He said he was embarrassed to tell people I was his daughter. 

When I was fat I bought an expensive jumpsuit for a big upcoming party. I spent hours perfecting my hair and makeup, I squeezed into heels so that my legs could look long. When I got there the boy I liked looked me up and down, turned to his friend and  loudly whispered ‚Äúfat b****‚Äù. They laughed and left and I wished I could fall through the floor. When I got home that night I cried because I was a shy nerdy girl and I couldn‚Äôt imagine what I had done to make him say that. 

I thought I used food to control my emotions but really I was controlled by food. 

Every night when my family had gone to sleep I‚Äôd pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed. I‚Äôd buy it after school from the grocery store, a different one each time because I feared the cashiers would recognise me and see exactly where all this food went - my cheeks, my waist, my thighs. 

I‚Äôd stuff my face until my stomach ached and the nausea crept up my throat and I was sure I had abused myself enough to truely be the beast people told me I was. 

Over the past year I‚Äôve lost enough weight to now be on the low side of a healthy BMI. I‚Äôve basically switched to a restriction ED, largely driven by the comments of people around me. 

And today the boy who called me a ‚Äùfat b****‚Äù asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other. He said I looked great and he wondered why we didn‚Äôt talk more in high school. I wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem. I wanted him to know how many nights I had spent crying over his careless words. But instead smiled and said I was happier leaving the past in the past.

I don‚Äôt know why I wrote this, I guess I‚Äôm just frustrated with how the world works. I wish I could have enjoyed high school, I wish people could have seen more to me than just my weight, I wish I didn‚Äôt think about food constantly.

Basically, make a list of safe foods (i.e. foods you general don‚Äôt binge on and feel safe eating) and a list of non safe foods (i.e. foods you tend to binge on or don‚Äôt feel comfortable eating) 

Next make a list of safe places (aka places you don‚Äôt generally binge, like a restaurant or in public with your friends) and non safe places (like your room alone) 

Lastly make a list of safe times (times you‚Äôre less likely to binge, for me it‚Äôs the morning or afternoon) and non safe times (times you‚Äôre more likely to binge, for me it‚Äôd be evening or late at night) 

From now on, 2/3 of those things need to be safe whenever you eat ANYTHING. Not in a safe place? If you‚Äôre going to eat, it has to be a safe food and at a safe time. Not eating a safe food? You bet your ass you have to eat it in a safe place and at a safe time!!! As long as 2/3 are safe - challenge yourself with something NOT safe. 

Not only does this encourage eating non-safe foods in a healthy way, it really helps deflect a binge if you stick to it.

When I was anorexic I started recovering and ate ""a lot"" and ""whatever I wanted"" and didn't gain crazy amounts of weight because I was eating about 1600 calories a day and that was crazy for me. But once I started binge-eating I could literally eat 5000 calories on what makes me feel ""full"" and ""what I wanted.""

I just want to shout out all the people on this forum with binge eating tendencies who literally can't commit to that sort of eating without spiraling down into deeper depression and self-hatred, and who are stuck between crazy restricting and having to still track at maintenance to ""recover"" and learn how to eat again.

When I was 15 I tried to recover by following the advice of ""you won't get fat if you just eat what you want,"" gained 20lbs, and started self harming because I hated myself so much. It doesn't work for everyone and that's my ted talk.

\*Edit: This blew up and so many of you commented how you agree and I just wanted to add that I think we need to stop perpetuating stereotypes within our own community about what recovery looks like for everyone. For some people it's weighing their food and losing weight, for others it's listening to their hunger.

Left the house with my boyfriend on Tuesday to buy ""groceries"", which to him means pop-tarts, frozen pizzas and cookies. 

Somewhere along the literally 5 minute drive we started talking about cats. I said I wished I could pet a cat because I was so stressed from school. So then we stopped at pet smart to ""pet the cats"". As we were walking inside, my boyfriend said ""I hate cats, so we are not getting one. We are only petting them. This is a de-stress trip to pet cats and that is it.""

Within 5 minutes of ""petting the cats"" my boyfriend was hand selected by a big fat male tabby who stuck his paw through the cage and gently tapped him on the ear. I look over a few minutes later and he has this big cat cradled in his arms, telling me we have to have him. 

So now we have a cat. And it's been 3 days and we never returned to the grocery store for the junk food run.

The dude is like 6‚Äô2, incredibly handsome, works out, studies engineering, amazing teeth and energy, but still struggles with self esteem, BAD. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm always blown away when he says something about feeling ugly because I tell no jokes when I say this man is a solid 9.5/10 by universal  standards. I was listing off all the attractive qualities about him in an attempt to make him feel better (like that EVER works with anybody), and he finally breaks: tells me he grew up really chubby and got thin in the beginning by severely restricting food. Even after losing the weight and seeing how people treated him differently he couldn‚Äôt shake the vision of himself he formed as a kid: fat, ugly, unloveable. If anything, ‚Äúglowing up‚Äù made him more insecure. I understood exactly what he meant. 

I grew up with cystic acne, chubby, awkward. I had no friends, nobody took me seriously, nobody saw me. Cue my junior year of high school, an eating disorder, platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity, kindness, respect and attention. I saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it, no matter the cost on my physical and mental health, and it proved 100% of my fears about people treating me badly because I was ‚Äúugly‚Äù. 

My friend and I both agreed that ‚Äúglowing up‚Äù didn‚Äôt make us any more confident: in fact, it made us more paranoid and kinda justified our bad ED behavior. We know what it‚Äôs like to be ‚Äúugly‚Äù, and we know how much better life treats you when you‚Äôre thin and ‚Äúpretty‚Äù.  We‚Äôll do anything not to go back, and we‚Äôre constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it. That we‚Äôre ‚Äúfat‚Äù again. We know it happened once and know that it could happen again. 

Both of us know that in reality our version of ‚Äúfat‚Äù is probably closer to healthy, and don‚Äôt judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards. Can anyone else relate??

Unlike many here, I never fit in with the absentee period crowd (tho I know that is just as dangerous). I had the eternal periods. For example: from sept 2018 to sept 2019 alone I bled for 236 days. 

I'd tried every birth control under the sun. And almost all of them made my migraines worse. I've seen specialists I have had two surgeries already (endometriosis), had all sorts of tests and imaging and have done my own research for what seems like forever.

I've been so anemic I could not leave my house to go for a walk. I was a shadow of myself, a depressed shell. 

All this bleeding exacerbated my ED. Between trying to restrict to lose my period, to depression eating. I have been so incredibly unhappy with my body. I felt like it was rebelling against me at every turn.  [MOOD](https://i.imgur.com/w2r50B3.gif)

But not anymore. I may be exhausted, bloated from all the air they pumped into me, in pain and afraid to take a deep breath or to go poop (lol)...but I am free. 

I'm making an effort to eat what I need to heal. My dumb fuckin lizard brain is having to take a backseat. I refuse to let this monster jeopardize my health and healing damnit.

But really I'm just so happy to be done with this horrible chapter. And I dunno if anyone here has suffered the same bleeding issues or has ever had or considered a hysterectomy; but I'm here if you have questions. 

Anyway thanks to anyone who read this. And thanks for letting me share.

So

If you eat 500kcal per day but it contains lots of sodium and carbs, your body will hold more water than usually. You _are_ 100% losing fat/muscle but the extra water might make the scale not move.

Or

You eat 500kcal per day but that's way too little (obviously) and longer term restriction has caused your intestines to slow down significantly. You haven't let out any of that indigestible shit(heh) and it basically weighs as much as your food. You're losing fat/muscle but your scale won't move.

That's all.

Calories are all that matters and if you're eating an impossibly unhealthily small amount of food you're 1000% losing weight. The scale is just not the best arbitur for what you're losing in those two scenarios.

When I came home for break last winter I‚Äôd been at my lowest weight and was restricting below 500; my friends convinced me to tell my therapist, who sent me to a nutritionist on campus and pushed me to refeed. I let myself eat regularly over the summer, which I didn‚Äôt spend at home, and kept it up into this past semester. And now I‚Äôm relapsing hard and trying to lose weight again.

The first thing my dad said to me when I stepped into the house was, ‚ÄúYou need to start losing weight. It‚Äôs unhealthy to be this fat.‚Äù (I‚Äôm in normal BMI range for my height by a long shot.) My mom comments at least once every few hours about how much fatter I look and how, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt fit into your old pants, do you?‚Äù While eating dinner on my first day back, they ordered Papa John‚Äôs pizza & wings and said, ‚ÄúShe eats so well, no wonder she‚Äôs gained so much weight.‚Äù We‚Äôd just spent the whole day moving into our new house.

I spend my breaks working at my dad‚Äôs sushi restaurant, which is mostly staffed by older Korean adults. Every. Single. Damn. Day. Someone assumes they have the right to make some fucking comment about how much weight I‚Äôve gained. Shit like, ‚ÄúI guess you just gain more and more weight each time we see you?‚Äù and ‚ÄúLook at her, she‚Äôs so chubby these days.‚Äù 

Yesterday while at work, I had a complete mental breakdown in public. I was trying not to cry behind the host stand. My dad came over to ask what was wrong and I just fucking broke down in front of him. I told him how every single time anybody sees me they make comments about how fat I am and how much it fucking hurts. I promised him through my tears and rage that I‚Äôd stop eating for fucking good if that‚Äôs what everyone wanted from me. One of the sushi chefs, who‚Äôd commented just a few minutes prior, came over to apologize (I didn‚Äôt respond). I was wiping tears away while giving takeout orders to UberEats drivers and showing customers to their seats. It was fucking humiliating.

This is all just to say, Asian (particularly Korean) culture regarding weight is so. Fucking. Toxic. Everyone thinks they have the right to say something that could be hurtful to anybody to me just because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre friends‚Äù and they don‚Äôt give a fuck about mental illnesses. My family members have called me fat for as long as I can fucking remember, as I‚Äôve always been a chubby kid. They compare me to my younger sister, who is 5 years younger than me, hasn‚Äôt fully gone through puberty yet, and was blessed with amazing genes. I‚Äôve fucking had enough. I‚Äôve never felt so motivated in my life to get as sick as I possibly can. When I hit my ugw and I‚Äôm withering away to nothing but bones and depression, they‚Äôll eat their fucking words and regret everything.

And they wonder why I have an eating disorder.

edit: everyone here is so damn lovely and supportive. You didn‚Äôt have to gild this, but thank you so much and thank you to everyone who‚Äôs left a comment. It means so so much to me that there‚Äôs a community out there for me in which I can find comfort when my family and friends turn their backs on me.

eating a normal amount makes me feel fake because i clearly am not repulsed by food, and i don't have to force it down. i enjoy it. i mean, during these periods, my thoughts are exactly the same as when i restrict and i always would rather be restricting. i feel the same guilt over the food i eat, but i still eat it in the first place. since developing an ed, i've lost weight pretty consistently, only gaining real weight when i've gone on vacation or during holidays. but i lose weight slowly as FUCK. i've lost only 35lbs since last may. and i have been having these disordered thoughts for almost the entire time. but where the fuck am i suffering???? i clearly don't have an issue with the act of eating, if i decided to recover i feel like it would be relatively easy for me because i fucking love food.

i feel like some wAnNaReXic lmao. i want to restrict 100% of the time and lose weight super quickly, but i can't, because i don't actually have an eating disorder i'm just forcing one. even though i've restricted to the point where i'm underweight. i just feel like i dont match any criteria for any eating disorders. i have no binging or purging issues, so i don't see how i could have EDNOS, but i feel like i eat normally enough of the time for anorexia to be wrong as well. part of the reason i want to lose even more weight at this point is because if i'm underweight enough then i know i have an eating disorder for sure.

But *then* I woke up this morning to the news that they have sourced kabocha *seeds*‚Äîand all the equipment one could ever need to grow them‚Äîand planted five in the yard. My father even prepared a little paintbrush to pollinate them. They‚Äôre sending progress pictures. 

The harvest is set for the week I land, the world is a less scary place, and my family have the patience of heroes.

It was too far to walk so yeah, I got a taxi. Most of the taxi drivers around here are moody, but I had a very chatty lady. 

We talked about loads of things (including our hatred of full fat milk).

I told her I was a psychology student. 

She said ‚Äòoh, are you going here for a work placement?‚Äô And I‚Äôm like ‚Äònah, I have an appointment lol‚Äô

Her response was: ‚Äòoh, I used to get treatment from *name of ED section*‚Äô and I was like ‚ÄòTHAS WHERE IM GOING‚Äô

We the bonded over anorexia experiences. 

Now, to reiterate, I‚Äôm a 19 year old anorexic psychology student, this was a 50 year old anorexic taxi driver. 

She ended up telling me how she used to do (something related to sports? I can‚Äôt remember exactly what it was). 

Unfortunately, she kept getting injuries so she‚Äôs been a taxi driver for the last 20 years. She‚Äôs recently started doing a beauty course but she was worried she was too old. So we gave each other pep talks and were being really positive and talking about citalopram (what she‚Äôs on) and fluoxetine (what I‚Äôm on) and it was overall exactly what I needed before goiing to a scary ED appointment on my own. I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot and I genuinely wish the best for her. She was so sweet.

This sub and the love from all of you posting and responding to each other has kept me on track to recovery better than my therapist.

Im still newly ""in recovery"" I think, but this has been my longest, healthiest bout (36 days now compared to 3-5 day binge cycles my whole life). I wanted to share what I think of as my ""secret to success"" just in case it works on a single other person.

The goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego, Skinny Cool Girl. 

SCG is basically my imaginary role model, who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist.

I wasnt doing so well on the hot part. Body dysmorphia or not I'm still not sure, but damn it I want to be SCG!

So I decided to...start something *else* SCG does (besides look good). To start rock climbing. To get my first tattoo. To start hiking. To try a kickboxing class. To go out with friends. I just went ""skinny dipping,"" no pun intended. My next step is to go dancing for the first time. I'm planning a backpacking trip for next summer. I'm going to class so I can get the degree SCG has.

SCG doesnt like everything she tries, but she tries anything. And she doesnt wait for other people to suggest things, she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out.

Basically *I* dont want to do those things, but SCG does. And I want to be SCG. So I go, and I have had a great time and maybe I'm getting a little bit closer to being her.

What I'm saying is: who will you be when you are YOUR Skinny Cool Girl? Will you go skydiving? Will you sing karaoke? Will you dress in bright bold clothes? Will you flirt with someone? Will you eat balanced meals, or apply for a better job? Will you perform or display your art? Will you go to bed on time?

What leap will you take someday in order to become her? When will she do *insert activity here* for the first time?

Can you make it happen now?

Take one of the things future SCG has about her that you dont have, that isn't weight related, and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment.

The brain, your soul, who you want to be does not change after you lose weight. Go be her. You have to *become* her still. Weight is only a small part of the equation. You'll catch up to SCG. Dont waste time while you think you're fat not being cool girl, or else you'll lose the weight and find out that SCG doesn't exist yet.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/d1nevh/skinny_cool_girl/

Can we say, victim blaming?! False equivalency?? 


A better analogy would be - wearing that yellow shirt is strongly encouraged by all celebrities. They all wear yellow shirts, and they SWEAR none of them get sick! 


It‚Äôs glamorous to wear a yellow shirt, and when you try on the shirt for the first time, everyone tells you how amazing it looks on you. So much better than those other shirts you wear. 


Now you don‚Äôt want to take the shirt off, but it‚Äôs making you sick. So you try wearing a black shirt but you miss the attention and adulation. You hate how the black shirt makes you look.

She was really nice and friendly as a lot of drunk girls are. I asked her if I should be more forward with the guy I was there with as I had a major crush on him, she said yeah and he became my boyfriend shortly after. 

We swapped Instagram's and after that night out I noticed what a sKiNnY lEgEnD she was becoming and how aesthetic her account was. Then I started to get worried for her because she seemed to get into very dangerous territory, she was so tiny. I'm one of them who looks 'normal' weight despite multiple ED patterns so it kind of hit me how fast she had gone so tiny, especially as my ED patterns started about the same time I met her and she was almost normal weight when we met.

Anyway, she did a post the other day saying she'd just got out of a clinic & that she's getting better. Even though she's essentially a stranger I'm so proud of her! I wish her a healthy future.

- NEVER brush your teeth right after purging. Wait AT LEAST a half hour, but preferably more, because the motion will erode the enamel that's been softened by recent exposure to acid. Instead... 

- Swish your mouth with plain water as many times as you can stand, then suck on a mint or chew some gum. Salivary flow will help get protect your teeth from any remaining acid. 

- Buy a sensitivity toothpaste. Even if they aren't sensitive yet, someday I promise they will be if you don't protect your enamel with the right products. These are designed to protect your enamel better than others, and from my experience, they actually work. 

- Use a children's mouthwash. These have a much higher fluoride content (which is often entirely absent in regular mouthwashes). Fluoride is vital in protecting enamel from acid erosion. Since I started using it my teeth are wayyyy less translucent. 

- If you're comfortable doing so, tell your dentist. They can prescribe medical-grade products and insurance will most likely cover it. 

- Avoid binging on highly acidic things and/or very sugary things (though I know those are often the most tempting). The prolonged exposure (as binges generally last a while) can cause problems all by itself. 

- From a darling commenter- chew tums when you're done! It'll neutralize the acid. That's it's job!

I have been on both sides of the spectorum and understand it. I may have literally jus been bmi 18.5 (last year rip) but I used to be obese and now I am normal i still have problems with food! 


my main message is that you are valid no matter what weight u are because EDs are a problem with your brain and your mind and can affect you physically both in losing and gaining weight or even just staying the same but you are still having problems and those problems are valid! it doesn‚Äôt matter if someone else has it worse than u cos you are still struggling you don‚Äôt think ‚Äòsean had a broken leg so my broken thumb means notbing‚Äô so why would weight and mental harm affect anything else?  xx

sorry for this I am just smashed lol

pls remember that most ppl rarely think about what they‚Äôve eaten afterward and just act on hunger cues, if you r reatericirjf or bingeing whatever it may be, you are valid no matter what!! xx

I wish I had willpower to restrict again but I know I still have issues with food because of the guilt and purging even if I can‚Äôt restrict, I am valid and true as are you!

12-24-2019 21:16:24,ef5qbt,71,"(SERIOUS DISCUSSION) Why do people lack the ability to empathize with eating disorder sufferers? Please give me your theories. Out of all the mental illnesses I have, anorexia is the ONLY one that people literally do not even TRY to understand at all",False,False,False,552,False,0.99,False,"I just don't get it. In addition to my eating disorder, I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Type 1, PTSD, anxiety, and struggle with addiction/alcoholism. Out of all those diagnoses, the only one that people literally don't even bother to try to understand is the anorexia. Most people are extremely empathetic about the PTSD and anxiety, and while bipolar is misunderstood sometimes, people don't make as many ignorant comments about it as they do my ED. And when I explain the brain chemistry behind the mental illness, they get it. 

But I've got good friends of mine who I have told time after time about my struggles with ED over this relapse the last 4 months and they continually just don't get it. At all. Why is that? Why is it so difficult for people to empathize with EDs? My friends who don't have alcoholism somehow still manage not to say triggering stuff about that and can respect my boundaries, and they get that being an addict isn't a choice, but something I have to manage regardless. My friends who don't have anxiety are still capable of comforting me during a panic attack. My friends who don't have PTSD understand why seeing a man who assaulted me in public can cause me to spiral. My friends without bipolar may have never experienced mania or suicidal depression, but they believe me when I say I am miserable and in pain. Yet, when I confide in people about my ED, it's always the same sorts of things, over and over. 

""Well you don't look bad, you still look healthy""

""I mean, 800 calories a day isn't that little, just try eating a bit more between meals""

""Purging is nasty""

""oh yeah, I didn't eat like anything today either, I just wasn't hungry""

RANT INCOMING

1. People do not understand the serious medical implications of struggling with an eating disorder, particularly when it comes to long term restriction and purging. You do not have to be 70 lbs to die of an eating disorder. 
2. Why do people need physical ""evidence"" of an eating disorder being bad before they give a shit? No one needed evidence when I relapsed into drinking, My grades were still perfect and I drank alone so people didn't see, but when I told people I was miserably drinking myself into a hole every night, they believed me. No one said some ignorant shit like ""well you're not drunk right now so clearly there's no problem."" Or when I say I'm depressed and considering suicide, no one says ""well you don't cry 24/7 so you're fine."" Why are the physical indicators so necessary for eating disorders to matter?

Guys, I'm honestly so upset. Every person I tell about my eating disorder either gives the stupidest advice (try a protein shake, etc) or tries to force feed me or  compares their experience to that time they lost their appetite due to the flu or says I'm being stupid by starving myself. These are good friends of mine who are super understanding and kind and empathetic when it comes to my other mental illnesses. 

What is it about eating disorders that make them so much harder to understand or empathize? It upsets me because I feel like my friends aren't even trying. And if they are, I don't feel like eating disorders are so complex that you can't see that continuously making body comments (either positive or negative) or other rude/offensive reactions might be detrimental to me. It makes me want to isolate and never talk about it again and just starve myself to death alone in my house.",Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ef5qbt/serious_discussion_why_do_people_lack_the_ability/

I think my fucked up hunger has caused me to binge on stuff that used to fill me up, which also happens to be super calorie dense. For example, some of the foods I binge on regularly are oats with a bunch of PB and sugar mixed in, mcdonalds burgers and thickshakes, cakes and icecream. Like for fucks sake, I literally drink milk by the cup. No wonder I've fucking ballooned to 135kg (bmi 38) in fucking 16ish months

this has been a huge physical and mental toll on me. the biggest clothes I could find in my area are tight. My 3xl work shirt, the biggest they make, is bulging. I sit inside all day because I dont want to be seen outside, i dont talk to anyone anymore, and I die inside when I imagine what my family say about me. 

idk where this is going. I'm sitting typing this after bingeing on a fucking burger meal with a thickshake and two mars bars, which I hardly even tasted. my stupid head just told me I needed to eat them and *snap* theyre gone. i've set my fasting timer, and i'm here telling myself im going to fast this binge off, for the umpteenth time in a row. all i can ever think of is food and suicide. *why am i like this*

sorry for the rant :/

Edit: thankyou everybody for the kind comments. I've had a really bad night, and knowing I'm not truly alone has made me feel a bit less shit.",oh no,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bywk8n/in_just_over_a_year_ive_gone_from_underweight_to/

when i'm eating 800 calories a day and fasting for 18 hours from 3pm til 9am the next morning (only allowing myself water between those hours) i feel this weird sort of bodily 'daintiness'. that's the only way i can think of to describe it? 

you know in films/books you sometimes see, or read about the girl character not eating much, like she'll have 2 mouthfuls of that broth, or just a tiny portion of dessert because she doesn't want a case of the shrinking corset?

just watching them eating so finely, so reservedly, it just gives off this air of elegance... and deprivation. like these girls are always fragile, or have a delicate constitution. it just seems so weirdly *feminine*.

so when i'm feeling hungry or eating carefully calculated meals, i can't help but feel that way. like a little bird just barely managing to eat. i feel this (probably very misplaced) purity inside, like i know precisely what's going inside my body, it's all very controlled, all very meticulous.

12-23-2019 10:24:03,eehugw,29,My tips for coping on Christmas Day no one asked for,False,False,False,515,False,1.0,12-23-2019 21:28:57,"I know it‚Äôs a tough time of year for a lot of us who celebrate Christmas so I just wanted to share whats helped me over previous and current Christmas times 

I hope that all of you are able to participate and fully enjoy yourself on the day, but for some I know it‚Äôs just not the case right now and there‚Äôs a lot of anxiety and increased behaviours - bingeing, purging, restricting, over exercising, lax abuse and so on. We want to avoid this on the day *and the days after Christmas*. (For me it‚Äôs always worse the days after because I feel so shit about what happens on Christmas days.)


So, here we go;


**Bring your own food.**

Most likely at least few people will be contributing dishes on the day - make and bring something along you absolutely know is safe and you can eat if everything else is too scary. 

Our safe foods are all different but a few ideas would be:

- Platters. Fruit, cut up veggies, crackers, cheese, hummus, dips, anti pesto, meats, whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with. Easy to chip away at and sustain your energy throughout the day without feeling like it‚Äôs too overwhelming. 

- Salads. You can have a big plate full of salad and no one will bat an eye. Lots of veggies, but you can also add things like strawberries, boiled eggs, beetroot, dressings, nuts, cheese, croutons, meats/faux meats, tomatoes, pomegranate, onions, etc (probably not all together but some interesting combos are really good)

- Veggie bakes. I‚Äôve made huge veggie lasagnas that were incredibly delicious and seemed super normal. You can use things like low fat cheese or vegan cheese alternatives or even cashews/potatoes blended up with nooch to make a cheesy sauce to bake a bunch of veggies in. Add in tomato sauce and pasta/pasta sheets (I use GF ones) (or layers of starchy veg like potato and pumpkin) and you‚Äôve got yourself a pasta bake/lasagna without oil, cheese, gluten or meat. Of course it‚Äôs not the same as the real thing but with a lot of strategic herbs and garlic, almost as good!

- Desserts! I‚Äôve made so many nice and ‚Äòsafe‚Äô raw vegan brownies/cakes/etc, but also things like meringues (egg whites + sugar/sugar alternatives), healthy cookies and cakes, parfaits, apple crumble and sugar free soy-custard, the possibilities are endless!! Just make sure you try it before offering it to your family, because some recipes really don‚Äôt work. 

**Wear something nice but also comfy**

Everyone eats more than they usually would on days like this. One day will not significantly affect your body or weight. One day of overeating and not compensating will **NOT** make you gain pounds and pounds of fat. 

So wear something forgiving. Wear something you feel confident in and also has room to move in. Skinny jeans, bodycon *anything*, tight waistbands - all no nos. 

I‚Äôm in the Southern Hemisphere so it‚Äôll be warm on Christmas Day. I‚Äôm wearing a beautiful flowy dress that covers my legs and belly and makes me feel great. 

Previous years I‚Äôve worn: T-Shirt dresses, Maxi dresses, rompers/play suits, knitted stretchy high waisted pants and a boob tube, flowy high waisted pants and a matching crop top, stretchy high waisted skirt and a light knit baggy sweater.

If it‚Äôs winter where you are: Perfect! Rug up and get cosy in clothes you love. Or wear a big ugly sweater and look cute as hell doing it.


**When people offer you food you don‚Äôt want**

Smile and politely say ‚ÄúNo Thank You.‚Äù And return to conversation. You don‚Äôt need to justify *why*, just leave it at no.

**If you receive food presents**

Don‚Äôt freak out, you don‚Äôt need to eat it in front of them to show your gratitude. If you think it will trigger a binge and/or purge, you can later re-gift it to someone else over the next couple of days, or give it to another family member the next day. But I strongly recommend allowing yourself to enjoy it in moderation. One year I got a box of 30 beautiful artisan dark chocolates. I had one every second or third day until March the next year. It was lovely to have a gift for that long and to always have something to look forward to in a day or two. I liked it so much that dark chocolate is something I‚Äôll still treat myself to every other week and I‚Äôm able to do so with moderation and genuine pleasure. 


**If people comment on your weight/looks/what you‚Äôre eating or if someone gives you the ‚Äúyou look so *healthy/good* and your brain twists it negatively**

1st option: if it‚Äôs malicious/negative - ignore that person and move to someone you like. Don‚Äôt give them power over you.

1st option part 2: shut them down with full force (there‚Äôs always at least *some* drama on family get-togethers)

2nd option: for well-meaning comments - this one is up to you. Remind yourself that most people do not *get* eating disorders and meant whatever they said from a place of love, encouragement and caring. They love you and honestly just want to see you live your life fully. They don‚Äôt want you to suffer. 

Looking healthy is a compliment. You‚Äôre glowing, you‚Äôre radiant, you‚Äôre bright and alert, you‚Äôre warm and affectionate, you look *beautiful*. You look beautiful for more than what a camera can capture. Our eyes see so much more than the physical.


**General Hecticness**

A lot of us thrive in routine, habit, structure. This disturbed can be extremely scary and stressful. 

- You can give yourself structure to the day by writing out what‚Äôs going to happen, roughly. Things like:

{wake up 8am, shower, wear x and x, finish wrapping presents, 10am drive to Mums. 11am-4pm Lunch at Mum‚Äôs. 4pm-5pm Drive to Dads. 5pm-9pm Dinner with Dad and family. 9pm Drive home. 10pm cuddle with [pet/partner] and organise my gifts.}

- Give yourself time outs whenever you need them. Go to the bathroom or sit outside for a few minutes and re-group. I carry essential oils to smell whenever I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, find what works for you. 

- Hang around your favourite person. Could be your same-age cousin or your quite old grandpa. Could be your dad or mum or bf/gf or your aunts cat. Your little niece. Whoever you need it to be. 


I know some of these won‚Äôt apply/won‚Äôt help some people because we all do different things and have different familiars but I hope it helps someone, or just prompts someone to have a think about how to prepare themselves for the day and hopefully a bit of harm reduction too.

Feel free to add anything!

05-03-2019 02:50:37,bk1vrs,18,I'm getting discharged from the hospital today!!!,False,False,False,511,False,1.0,05-04-2019 23:45:28,"It's taken 3 months, but they are finally discharging me from inpatient hospitalization. In those 3 months I went from being 76.1 lbs (11.6 BMI) to finally weighing in at a normal BMI today - 123.9 lbs (18.8 BMI).

So I gained almost 50 pounds and it hasn't been easy dealing with the weight gain, but there are so many things that I've slowly gotten back over the course of my recovery here.

When I first came to the hospital I was almost on my deathbed and immobile - could barely lift up my head to take a sip of water. I had to be pushed around in a wheelchair for about a month and was on TPN (basically getting almost all my nutrition from a tube in my arm) for about the same amount of time. My heart rate was consistently in the 40s and my blood sugar and blood pressure were dangerously low. My mom and sister had to stay by my bedside 24/7 and care for me, cause I couldn't do things like go to the bathroom or take a shower on my own. I not only looked like death, but I also felt like death, and everything hurt.

A lot of it was really hard. A lot of crying, screaming, fighting over a few bites of food but the staff here were super patient and kind throughout it all. Since I'm not in a facility that is specifically for treating eating disorders I had a lot of trouble at times but moving to the intensive ward helped a lot.

Today, I am by no means cured and I still have a lot of hard days. But on those hard days I try to remember how far I've come and how many important & wonderful things I've reclaimed in my life.

I can walk. I no longer eat out of a tube. I ate Dunkin Donuts this week!!! My butt doesn't hurt anymore, and the butt cave is gone (see my post history lol). I'm not constantly freezing. I can eat good food again (sometimes), and I went to my favorite Mexican restaurant recently! My relationship with my family has improved DRASTICALLY, and they have become a vital support system to me. I am no longer afraid of hospitals and am comfortable asking for help when I need it. And I am still not 100% healthy but I am healthier and have the energy to do things like walk my dog, go on short hikes, and go birdwatching!!

So I guess more than anything this post is kind of just me trying to comfort myself, haha. But yknow what, I heckin deserve some comfort after all the shit I've been through. And so does everyone here. 

I'm scared of what comes next, and how to deal with life outside of the tiny, safe, sterile bubble that is a psych ward (I am so institutionalized oof), but I have to keep telling myself, I have so much to look forward to. 

Recovery is DEFINITELY worth it!

EDIT: I want to say thank you to all the lovely and kind comments on this post. Reading them has really made not only my day, but my whole week and will definitely help to fuel me to continue my recovery journey!!!",Victories,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bk1vrs/im_getting_discharged_from_the_hospital_today/

There are almost never fights and nobody talks shit when someone isn't restricting as much. Also, we know that eating disorders can affect anyone, no matter their body type, skin colour etc.

03-14-2019 23:13:33,b155ly,73,The reason your binge is never as satisfying as you want it to be,False,False,False,514,False,1.0,03-14-2019 16:27:01,"The reason you get so excited about a binge and feel compelled to is because of your dopamine receptors.  Thinking about/planning a binge is when your dopamine is firing.  Contrary to popular belief, dopamine is not at its peak when you‚Äôre engaging in the pleasurable activity.  It‚Äôs at its peak in the planning/anticipation phase, which when you think about it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective.

The reason you keep binging past the point of pleasure is

1) Your dopamine fueled planning told you it would be the most amazing thing ever and you continue to seek for that amazing feeling.

2) Since your dopamine was at its peak during the anticipation phase, that means once you start binging (once you receive the reward your body craved), dopamines job is done and begins to diminish.  You are still seeking that rush and are trying to find it in the food, but it will never be there.

That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre left wanting and keep eating past the point of full.

Once you acknowledge that the peak of exciting and feel good chemicals is likely at checkout in the grocery store or driving up to your home, it makes the binge event a lot less exciting.

Your pleasure comes from planning the binge, not the binge itself.  The act of binging is just the result of your primitive brain responding to the dopamine fueled decision.

He also took me shopping and told me to buy all my safe foods, and lots and lots of vegetables. his only requests are that I take my vitamins every day, eat a lot of veggies and healthy foods, and that I aim for 800-1000kcal a day.

I almost always can‚Äôt just ‚Äúeat something else‚Äù if someone takes the food I‚Äôve bought for myself, I have to go get myself more food, or starve. My food is also often quite expensive since if I want anything tasty I have to get specialty items. 

My whole family knows this and is generally respectful, with one exception: my sister in law.
She was fine about it until she had kids, became emotionally unstable, and started getting constantly catered to by everyone. Now she thinks she‚Äôs queen shit of fuck mountain, and does whatever she pleases with no regard for anyone else. This includes eating weeks worth of my safe foods when she comes over. Fortunately, she only goes for my dry goods (all the my stuff that needs to be refrigerated is stuff she‚Äôs not interested in because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo healthy‚Äù). 

She will DEMOLISH any little indulgence that I might be parceling out over a month for myself though (snack packs, 100cal baggies of weighed Lily‚Äôs almond chocolate, specialty baked goods etc), and it pisses me off, ruins my budgeting, and fucks up my meal plans. So, I started hiding my little treats in my bedroom. That worked for about a week, but then last weekend when she was over with her kids she sniffed out my stash like a grizzly bear, and ate thousands of calories and $50 worth of food while I was out walking my dog. I was livid and confronted her, she cried to my brother and parents that I was shaming her and that I was selfish. She also claimed it was the first time she‚Äôd ever done it (bullshit), it was a misunderstanding (TOTAL crap) and she wouldn‚Äôt do it again ‚Äúif she could help it‚Äù(you‚Äôre an adult woman!). My parents told me they‚Äôd pay to replace anything she ate 3 fold if I‚Äôd just drop it and save them the headache. 

I took that deal, bought myself replacements for my stolen food, a food safe, and a few **extra special** treats *just for SIL to find*.  I bought a bunch of fiber one bars, which I usually don‚Äôt get, and laxative chocolate (I‚Äôm not a laxative user) which I portioned into little baggies like I usually do with my Lily‚Äôs and bakery items. I put all the food I actually wanted inside my food safe, but stacked the fiber one and laxative in their baggies on top (I also put some snack packs and rice cakes with it so it wouldn‚Äôt be too conspicuous of a trap), and labeled the foods on top ‚ÄúPlease do not eat, these are my safe foods!‚Äù. Today she brought her brood over, and I took the dog for a walk as usual. Lo and behold, everything that wasn‚Äôt in the safe was totally devoured when I got back. She confronted me about the safe, and said I was overreacting (amazing, given the fact that she‚Äôd just raided literally all the food I hadn‚Äôt locked up), but I just responded pleasantly that I was trying to ensure there‚Äôd be no more ‚Äúmisunderstandings‚Äù. About an hour after she confronted me she started to look a little green and kept running off to the bathroom. She looked miserable, and ultimately had to call my brother to come pick her and the kids up because she didn‚Äôt think she could drive. 

My brother just called me a few minutes ago, because apparently she shit herself in the car on the way home, has shit herself 4 more times since, and is having a mental breakdown. She‚Äôs been blaming me and claiming I poisoned ‚Äúher food‚Äù. I feigned confusion. ‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt touch her food-...Oh! Oh my god! I didn‚Äôt even notice that SIL had eaten ALL of my food again today but I just checked and she ate everything that didn‚Äôt fit in my safe!!! Oh no! Oh my god! When we talked last week she said she wouldn‚Äôt do that again, AND I put a note on everything that said not to eat it so I thought it would be ok! No wonder she‚Äôs sick though! She ate 4 full boxes worth of fiber one squares, and a whole laxative bar! You should take her to the doctor!‚Äù  . There was a long pause, my brother didn‚Äôt know what to say. Finally he asked why I had laxatives and tons of fiber one, I told him I‚Äôd been constipated and since it was in my room,  labeled not to eat it, and had been discussed previously I didn‚Äôt think it would be a problem. He let out a long sigh and asked me what kind of laxatives and what the dosage was in case a doctor asked. I told him, and we got off the phone amicably, he even texted me an apology about her eating my food again, and offered to Venmo me money for it. He seems to either believe I didn‚Äôt do it intentionally, or feel as if he can‚Äôt be mad about it if I did because his wife is a gluttonous lying thief. They‚Äôre currently en route to urgent care, and I‚Äôm quite pleased with myself. 

Never mess with a sick girls safe food. 


TLDR: SIL continuously steals my safe foods despite being confronted multiple time and being asked to stop, and understanding that it‚Äôs a really big issue for me and my overall health when she does. I put fiber one bars and laxatives in place of my safe foods. She ate them all in the span of 2 hours, and got very sick. 


**Update**: 

For all those worried about my SIL, she‚Äôs physically fine. She had an embarrassing time at the hospital having to explain what happened to her while shitting all over herself, they gave her IV fluids and some medicine to make her feel a bit better and stop the uncontrollable diarrhea. She‚Äôll probably have a bad stomach for a week or two and then be right back to her regular unbearable self. 

To those who are concerned about the legal implications of my actions, I did do a bit of research beforehand, and because the food was behind a locked bedroom door, labeled not to be eaten, AND I have proof of previous conversations where I‚Äôve asked her to not eat my food I‚Äôm pretty much in the clear. Also, my SIL has no financial ability to acquire a lawyer to sue me without my brother‚Äôs support. My brother would absolutely not support her in any attempt to seek legal action. 

I had lunch with my brother today, and he seems to be aware that my actions were intentional (his exact words were  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me if I‚Äôm right, because I don‚Äôt want to know, but I just want you to know I‚Äôm on your side here and I‚Äôm not mad‚Äù). He told me this has been an eye opening occurrence for him, because the reactions of the doctor and hospital staff made it clear that they thought SIL was absolutely deranged for having stolen and eaten that much food, and for her behavior while getting care. He said he felt true humiliation to be standing next to her and calling her his wife. One nurse took him aside and recommended that he get her psychologically evaluated. He told me that this made him realize just how out of control her eating and other behaviors have gotten, he confided to me that she‚Äôs been spending over a thousand dollars a month of binge foods, and that they can‚Äôt keep certain food for the kids in the house for longer than an hour without her devouring them. She‚Äôs also put on 80lbs in the last year, and is teetering on the edge of T2 diabetes. 

My brother has decided that he‚Äôs going to give her an ultimatum. Either she voluntarily goes to an inpatient clinic, or he‚Äôs going to seek a separation until she does. She‚Äôs deeply in denial about her food issues, she grew up as the thin and perfect cheerleader and she can‚Äôt comprehend the that she‚Äôs now an out of control food beast, but she also has literally nowhere else to go since she‚Äôs a SAHM with no college degree, no marketable skills, no job experience, and no family willing to take her in. 

I hope she‚Äôll get treatment. But I doubt it, I think she‚Äôs too proud and too food addicted to do it right now, and my brother made it clear to me that he absolutely will not give her more than a week to decide what her choice is. Either way it will be nice to have her of my life (and food stash) for a while, or permanently.

03-20-2019 08:14:44,b37zqe,57,a testament to the insanity of eating disorders: a list of food crimes i've committed in my university's public dining hall,False,False,False,485,False,0.99,03-20-2019 01:11:16,"so i'm pretty sure i'm losing my mind but i've been able to laugh at myself recently and i wanted to share a list of weird shit i've done in my college's dining hall. for context: my college has a meal plan based on 'swipes' of your ID card. each semester you get a set number of 'swipes' that you can use to get meals at different restaurants on campus. one 'swipe' at the dining hall gets you basically unlimited access to a buffet-style restaurant. they have a bakery, a grill, a salad bar, a sandwich station, pizza, and some other shit depending on the day. everything has a calorie label which is pretty cool but probably not super accurate, whether or not i decide to trust the info depends on my mood really. the food is from aramark, so it's pretty mediocre, but whatever. it's a pretty good deal for just one swipe. but of course, i am a degenerate, and i'm pretty sure every employee knows me by now.  

during my restrictive phases, i:  

- frequently swiped in JUST for coffee. the coffee wasn't good but i could drink literally as much as i wanted, so i'd go in and drink like 6 cups and nothing else   

- brought my food scale in to weigh vegetables from the salad bar. i'd bring it in my backpack, make a salad, then take it to some secluded area in the dining hall and weigh each individual ingredient and log it into MFP  

- often, these 'salads' were literally just pickles, iceberg lettuce, and mustard. they looked absolutely vile and tasted pretty much exactly like you would expect a pickle/lettuce/mustard salad to 

- brought measuring spoons/cups to measure stuff like condiments 

- you're not technically allowed to take stuff from the dining hall but i would smuggle in containers to take vegetables from the salad bar to steam in the microwave in my dorm. this isn't really all that weird in theory but i would literally grab a plate, load it up with ALL OF THE BROCCOLI/CAULIFLOWER THEY HAD and then waltz on over to some secluded area to stash my haul in the containers i brought. i had to walk past SO MANY PEOPLE with a giant plate of just ??? raw broccoli ??? i did this with lots of different vegetables depending on what they had that day but i'm a hoe for cruciferous veg so that's mostly what i got 

- taken like 8 apples at a time to do apple monos 

- they have a section for cereal/milk and they offer unsweetened almond milk so i've definitely used a swipe just to fill up a few bottles to take back with me 

these are all pretty insane but that's not even the worst part. i am an absolute GOBLIN in my binge phases, and unlimited food plus AN b/p does NOT mix. for more context, i am visibly underweight so i get looks already (my bmi ranges from 14-15 depending on what phase i'm in) and i will remind you again that this dining hall is VERY PUBLIC. when i'm in binge mode i have z e r o shame apparently. 

- a standard binge usually involves me making a beeline for the bakery to see what they have. i'm a monster who can't get enough sugar and their cookies are bomb as fuck, so i'll usually load up with like 6 and then get some brownies or cupcakes or whatever they have that day. after i get my haul, i get a big ass bowl of cereal and dip all of my cakes/cookies/etc. into it to soak them in milk and eat them like that. then i eat the cereal. it's fuckin' weird enough for someone to literally only eat desserts but i have to do it that way for e f f i c i e n c y   

- at the sandwich station they have peanut butter, jelly, butter/cream cheese for bagels, etc. but one time they had nutella so of course i got a bunch of chocolate chip cookies, spread nutella on them and made nutella chocolate chip cookies sandwiches then i dipped them in a glass of chocolate soy milk and ate them. it was like two hours before they closed so i was pretty alone but there was a middle aged man watching me the whole time and he looked like a mix of disgusted and terrified but i'm an absolute demon and pressed on anyway  

- taken the cereal bowls to the soft serve machine instead of using the cones or small bowls and filled that bitch up. i also dip brownies and cookies into the ice cream, or crumble them up into it 

- i have eaten MULTIPLE peanut butter and chocolate sauce sandwiches just cause i had the ability to make them. no one girl should have all that power 

- i accidentally went to the dining hall when my roommate was there, unbeknownst to me, and made direct eye contact with her while carrying two plates, one with 3 slices of pizza drenched in ranch with a giant pile of fries, the other with probably 4 cookies, 2 cupcakes, and a bigass waffle. she didn't acknowledge me, i didn't acknowledge her, we didn't talk about it later   

+plus probably a whole lot more that i can't remember. i don't know exactly why i felt the need to confess my sins here but i guess i just want anyone who reads this long ass post to know that hey, if you're ever feeling embarrassed by the way your ED makes you act, you're probably not nearly as embarrassing as i am! my eating disorder has turned me into an absolutely insane vomit gremlin with zero sense of shame. EDs aren't cute, they're weird and gross and scary and sad but sometimes life really do be like that.

Fuck this little motherfucker. This piece of shit. This shitlicker is made of cocoa powder and orange juice. It's a jelly face mask, which means it's literally the texture of chocolate pudding.

I've tasted a number of our products before (for research) (duh) so I know perfectly well how bad they actually taste when you eat them, but oh my god. I get the urge to lick my fingers when I show a customer how it's used. Sure it's made of mud and seaweed too, but nobody's perfect. 

This product looks and smells so fucking delectable it's overridden my year-old toughened retail exterior, calloused from telling thirteen teenage boys a day that they'll be blocked up all weekend if they eat the fresh face masks.

Now I'm Bryce. I haven't tried to eat any yet partially because I ""know better"" and partially because of how much pride I'd lose for giving in to the siren song of such a basic product. But the season isn't over yet. There's time.

So, on the left, I was roughly a BMI of 14.5ish, hadn't eaten proper food (250 kcal or less a day) for about two weeks, and on the left was me approx 3/4 weeks into my recovery, in London, at the EL&N Cafe. I'd never have gotten to go there, have the energy to walk around, eat with my boyfriend, and generally enjoy myself if I hadn't taken the leap.

Don't get me wrong - Recovery sucks. I've only just stopped eating like 4k a day and am generally starting to be able to not only think about food. I look in the  mirror and I see a bloated body, but I also see small muscles forming again. My ECGs are normal now, my failing kidneys, bladder, heart & liver are all improving. My seizures stopped. 40 lbs in a month of water, fat and muscle is a LOT of weight gain, but I was also dehydrated, bordering on catatonic & generally, frankly, dying. My weight is now naturally falling again and my loose skin is improving - so it wasn't true weight.

I was starting to slip back into relapse, but I looked at the photo on the left again, yesterday. Back then, all I saw was fat. A disgustingly fat face, but now I see how gaunt and sickly I actually looked. I don't want to be dying, being threatened with a tube, feeling like life is nothing but lethargy. I couldn't even play video games, or work on any art (two favorite hobbies), as I had so little energy. My days were spent in bed. Finally started drawing again, and playing again. 

Idk what the point of this post is, maybe to try and inspire someone else to take that leap, too. I wouldn't have done it without watching people like Elanzi, Hatwillbeatthis, Rebecca Leung, etc. They inspired me to just go for it, so I'm kinda hoping I can do the same. 5 weeks ago, I accepted the thought that my anorexia would kill me.

01-15-2019 06:49:12,ag4us9,41,Want to start purging?,False,False,False,469,False,0.99,01-15-2019 17:38:07,"This post is for you, regardless of your bmi, current ED, your walk of life... purging WILL fuck you over.

A purge is a bandaid solution. You know that. You might be interested in doing it to:

- start fresh

- after a bad binge 

- maybe you were forced to eat out with friends/family and you ate what you didn‚Äôt want to

- you want to be the Cool Girl/Guy who looks like they eat whatever and ‚Äústay‚Äù/‚Äúget‚Äù skinny

- maybe you do it for self harm purposes 

As someone moving from BED to Bulimia, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve concluded.

**APPEARANCE**

I‚Äôm not saying y‚Äôall are like me, but I can be vain as fuck and put my appearance first. Here‚Äôs what you get with purging. 

- Weight change. I know this is obviously the big thing. Obviously the scale goes down compared to before a purge. But you‚Äôre losing a lot of water, stomach acid etc. which gives you this false sense that you‚Äôre losing weight. In reality, most bulimics will maintain or (more likely) gain weight longterm even though you‚Äôre ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùcorrecting‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù your purge. Most bulimics are in the normal-overweight BMI and not formally diagnosed.

- Teeth are fucked, thin, sensitive,  yellow and breath smells bad 24/7

- The skin around your mouth will be ravaged. It‚Äôll be raw and you‚Äôll break out in pimples and weird texture from the stomach acid, snot, tears, vom, bile that comes up

- Swollen glands make your cheeks v chipmunky... my face looks like an amorphous pancake compared to my body and BMI. Nothing will help accelerate your face getting back to normal. Not diuretics, changing water intake, electrolytes. It goes a little with each day you don‚Äôt purge.

- Bloodshot eyes, petechiae, burst capillaries around your facs. Nothing really helps it go away faster it just takes days.

- Your hands will get scarred and tears and bleeding. 

- Heartburn and stomach pains 24/7. Gut flora is fucked to high heavens. Burps and farts (so much GAS goddamn) and lots of bloating. Surprise involuntary regurg is a bitch.

- Nothing cuter than purging out of your nose or pissing your pants because of the strain of purging üôÉ. Splashback is also a very real thing... and so is the toilet blocking up biG time

- Your throat is raw and painful, increased episodes of tonsilitis. 

**FEELINGS and FUNCTIONING**

- I hear people purge because the purge itself gives them a high. Let me warn you, you may lose the purge high. I don‚Äôt feel calm or good or pure like I used to after purging, everytime I near the end of a dissociative binge I absolutely hate and fear the purging after.

- Some, like me, purge to gain back the loss of control that occurs with a binge or the guilt after eating anything at all. There is NOTHING that makes you feel as helpless and out of control than getting stuck in a b/p cycle. 

- After you purge food, your body is prepped and rearing to break down food, so with the food gone, your hunger level comes back to before or worse. I always thought I would have ‚Äúbetter control‚Äù than to get stuck in a b/p cycle, but I swear it‚Äôs a slippery slope that inevitably happens.

- my gag reflex has been desensitised so my methods of purging become more and more aggressive. I‚Äôm sure if i had a dental check up, I‚Äôd have bruises down my throat

- You‚Äôll lose electrolytes purging which means more fainting, lightheadedness, poorer concentration in work/study

- Purging comes with increased risks of losing consciousness (and if you pass out at the toilet bowl, you could at least chip a tooth, at worse cause life-threatening damage) and choking whilst purging which is damn terrifying. 

**SOCIAL LIFE and FINANCES**

Don‚Äôt be blindsided by thinking purging will let you have a better social life- afterall most social activities involve food, right?

- The fear of choking during the following purge will get you choosing foods you don‚Äôt even like, so that it comes back up easier.

- you will be the odd one who always runs to the bathroom afterwards or has to leave asap to purge. If you can‚Äôt purge in time, the anxiety floods in and you (read: me) may get a bit mental

- you will at some point have your purging session interrupted by someone. Whether it‚Äôs by a stranger in a restaurant bathroom, a friend, a family member... that shit is mortifying and isolating.

- You will get more and more desperate with where you purge. Maybe it starts out in the ‚Äúsafety‚Äù of your home... one thing leads to another and you‚Äôre ready to purge at the vilest, Jackson-Pollock-y gas station toilet. Gross and unhygienic but you can‚Äôt help yourself.

- B/P cycles (read later in this post) are fucking EXPENSIVE. You are buying food that will not stay long enough to give you macronutrients or micronutrients. You are literally flushing money down the toilet. One thing that keeps me up at night, is the disgust I feel knowing I wasted so much food, resources, time, energy and money because of this disorder. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This is an elaboration on my response to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/afmp84/comment/ee0k53c), thanks u/HoldenCaulfield7 for encouraging me to make this a separate post. 

At the end of the day, I can only share my warnings and experiences with y‚Äôall. 

The temporary ‚Äúgood‚Äù is nothing compared to the harms it‚Äôs given me, and I still feel shackled to this disorder daily. Please be careful y‚Äôall and rethink starting purging üíõ

I never thought I would be someone who would purge because I'm so terrified of vomiting. But lately the desire has been stronger and stronger, the need to just ""undo"" whatever binge I just ate, especially if I'm guilty or anxious or depressed, the panic making my stomach feel bloated and wrong and the idea of getting it back up out of me is becoming less scary and more of a relief.

But I don't do it. I won't do it. Because I know myself and I know that if I started, if it clicked for me, then it would be very hard for me to stop, if I could stop at all. It would be too easy for me to think I could ""just undo"" a binge after every minor crisis.

* AN isn't about getting as ~sKinNy~ as possible. Mostly it's driven by fear of gaining weight, resulting in a perpetual deficit 

* For some (many?), it's not about hating your body, it's about having discrete goals you know how to obtain when everything else in your life is a shit fire

* Losing your period from an ED IS NOT GOOD! It causes low bone density and fertility issues and can mess you up even after recovery 

* THE ISOLATION. Holy shit, I did not realize how bad it could get. So many social events revolve around food. That, or you just hate the way you look so much, you can imagine putting yourself in public.

* BED is a real disorder and deserves treatment just like any other ED. 

* Not all EDs (or even most) fall perfectly in the criteria of BN and AN. They're still real and just as valid to get help for. If your relationship with food is stressful, you should always feel validated to ask for help.",Rant / Rave,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/edt6k1/the_shit_they_taught_us_about_eds_in_school_was/

07-20-2019 12:15:06,cfjv9v,66,one other (sort of contradictory) post about eugenia and my unpopular opinion,False,False,False,460,False,0.96,False,"i really, really, truly don't think it is anyone's business what she's going through. i watched the shane video and cringed all the way through it, and i am *sickened* by youtube 'news' channels but took on board the point ryland made, about how people on youtube act like your best friend, thereby making the viewer/s feel as if they have some say in said youtuber's life. and whilst that seems to be the case, *i really don't think that anyone has the right to try and compel / force / make another person do anything, under any circumstance.*

eugenia is not a fucking communal 'example' of recovery. she's a *human being*, not a goddamn poster girl for recovery. she does NOT owe a 'recovery story' to ANYONE, she does not have ANY obligation to 'come out' with details of her ED, and she shouldn't be under ANY pressure to do ANYTHING. 

because it's her life. being told what to do by people in our lives, much less by strangers on the internet, is not only suffocating and most of the time unwanted, but *utterly invasive*. 

it's fantastic and brilliant that eugenia decided that she wanted to try and recover. *but it's no one's fucking business*. 

there are so many disgusting videos about her out there, 2 different sorts:

1) are the people who have too much time on their hands and think that their opinions and views about someone they don't even know personally are relevant and important enough that the whole world should be entitled to hear them

2) drama seeking virtue signallers who cry on camera and act ~so concerned~ and ~so worried~ because they think ""if i pretend to seem really concerned and worried for eugenia, i will look like a caring and compassionate individual"".

then there's the secret variety #3 - people who take a sincere interest in her, and care for her wellbeing, but *don't feel the need to broadcast it for views, because they actually DO care, and DON'T just want to use her to get attention*.

eugenia seems like a sweet girl. it's also been obvious to anyone with eyes that she is / has been incredibly unwell, and that if she didn't get help, she'd die. 

but beyond that, all the details are eugenia's alone. she doesn't owe anyone anything. 

she has a youtube channel - this doesn't make her a catholic idol. she is under no obligation to 'be a good role model' or 'set an example' for anyone.

people have eating disorders regardless of her existence and her experiences. 

she's just a girl who happens to have an ED, who happens to want to deal with it in her own way, *and that's fine and no one should be saying otherwise*. 

i feel like in this day and age, people are so goddamn entitled. people feel as if they are entitled to X, Y, or Z, without actually thinking about the emotional/mental expense of the person it's coming from. 

i have questions and i wonder things just like everyone else, but it's *none of my business*. watching the shane view made me think 'holy cow, was she really oblivious? was she really just a casual anorexic who managed to almost die without noticing? is it even possible for someone to have an ED and not obsess over it, not live and breathe it every day and night???' because it seems that she's presenting it that way. but my overriding opinion still stands: it's none of my business. the 'truth' is no one's business. she doesn't owe her story to anyone.

i'm gonna wrap it up here and do a chris crocker and just say 'leave eugenia alone' because i think (whether she likes it or not) there are way too many people who have something to say about her life when in actuality her life is hers and hers alone to judge and comment on.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cfjv9v/one_other_sort_of_contradictory_post_about/

*soft, melancholy music plays in the background*

A rail-thin girl‚Äôs huge, haunted eyes brim with unshed tears as she stands semi-silhouetted against a window, her delicate collarbone visible and the loose neck of her oversized sweater slipping gracefully from her shoulder.

Him, voice gentle and pleading, overflowing with concern, as he places a comforting hand on her bony shoulder: *darling please, you need to eat. I‚Äôm so worried about you. Please, just try a bite*

Act One, Scene Two: Reality

34-year-old Functional Wreck(TM) gets back from 11-mile run at 3am and spies a bowl of homemade spaghetti steaming on the counter. The spaghetti she told her husband an hour ago she DID NOT WANT. Her blood pressure rises. A distant siren wails: ALERT; Potential Argument incoming.

She goes upstairs to change out of her running gear, counts all her ribs in the mirror, watches herself get fatter in front of her own unreliable eyes, and put on the same 4-sizes-too-big joggers and hoodie she‚Äôs been wearing for a week.

Comes back downstairs, gritting her teeth.

Him: [tensely] I made spaghetti.

Her [cautiously]: uhh yeah, so I see

Him [firmly]: you should have some. I made you a small bowl and left the cheese off

Her [with forced jollity]: oh no, I‚Äôm fine thanks!

Him [flatly, clearly irritated]: I don‚Äôt want to deal with this stupidity. I‚Äôm going to bed.

*Husband exits stage left*

Woman digs empty tin can out of the garbage, looks furtively over her shoulder as she carefully spoons spaghetti into empty can. Buries can at bottom of bin, places some more rubbish on top.

Of course, I still overtrained and restricted for the whole day leading up to the date, because I wanted to have a glass of white wine and this bitch can't deal with the calories in alcohol.

So, as a starter, we ordered some fish tartare. I was feeling great about it, because you know, my ortho ass is a slut for lean protein. But! It came served with a side of salad, fresh fruit, brown bread and... Salted butter.

You guys. Butter is THE fear food for me. I hadn't had it in YEARS. But yesterday I allowed myself to pick the smallest slice of bread, spread a smudge of butter on it (couldn't have been more than 5 grams tbh - small steps), and eat it. And I didn't feel guilty afterwards. I genuinely thought I was never going to eat butter ever again for the rest of my life, yet here I am.

DAE remember the skinny cool girl strategy someone posted about 1 week ago? I thought a lot about it. The idea of SCG strategy was to think of the future self as motivation, so I asked myself who I wanted to be in the future, and concluded I just want to be a normal eater. So I started to think what a normal eater would do in every situation, and today I avoided a binge.

I was near that sandwich place I love and I wanted to have something... BUT THEN I started to talk to me. I asked myself what a normal eater would do. ""Am I hungry?"" No I wasn't. And I started to think what my sister, my mother, my coworkers, would do in that case. The answer was always "" they wouldn't stop, they wouldn't even think about it"". And I acted like them!

I know.. tHanKs I'm CuReD. BUT it worked for me!

Edit: the basic idea is.. I feel like I ""unlearned"" my normal behaviour and now I need to have a role model to learn it again. I think I lack a sense of normality.

honestly I know I‚Äôm not actually fat at a size uk 6/8 but I‚Äôm definitely not super skinny, I‚Äôm short and have a small frame so I always feel like I carry my weight badly and that I‚Äôm still fat despite being small. idk maybe other people don‚Äôt see it that way and when my friends call me skinny I‚Äôll disregard it as flattery but the fact that a brutally honest kid said it really made me stop hating my body just for a little bit. It‚Äôs been a few hours since he said that and now I‚Äôm like ‚Äòbut kids have a skewed perception of reality I really am a chonky bitch‚Äô lol. My self image has been improving recently though, I‚Äôve gotten back to weight training and have started to notice some muscle gains and I‚Äôve also been trying my hardest to recover from bulimia. I‚Äôve gone from purging multiple times a day to only purging 5 times in the past 42 days!! funnily, I think the incessant need to have everyone (including myself) think that I‚Äôm skinny has passed, I just really want to be a normal person with normal eating habits again even if that means accepting that I‚Äôm a normal weight

I don't think she ever sought treatment, but it was definitely there. I think drunkorexic, and my mom caught her purging a few months before she died. Her safe foods were Mr. Goodbars and pink wine, and she would have huge dinners on the weekend. 

She just collapsed one day. They found cancer, and she gave in after that. Checked into hospice and very quickly withered away because she had no body fat to sustain on. 

The last time I saw her was in the hospice. It didn't even look like the end because she had always been so thin. She was smiling. I think she was glad to finally have a physical ailment; almost a validation of the internal demons she suffered for so long. I don't remember what she said. 

When I would stay with her on the weekends, she would just spoil me to death. New computers, video games, a puppy, CDs, SNACKSNACKSNACKS, and so on. Mostly she left me alone, which was fine by me. I liked the quiet. 

She would pass out drunk with her eyes open -- I remember this vividly. I used to sneak and steal her candy and I feel so bad for that now. 

I'm so like her in many ways. My food hoarding habits definitely come from her. My inability to portion meals comes from her. I'm not saying this to tarnish her memory. It's important to remember how disordered she was so I can model healthier habits.

I don't doubt that this way of thinking is a result of people associating eating disorders with teenage girls, whose feelings are frequently dismissed as silly and shallow anyway.

This disease has become its own identity living in my body, a parasite draining my lifeforce to sustain itself. I've been hospitalized for times than I can even remember, both psychiatric and medical admissions, inpatient treatment programs, near-death/close calls/""ah-ha"" moments. It's cost me meaningful relationships, experiences, opportunities; it hurts to think about how different things could have been without this. Looking back, what stands out isn't what I learned in university, studying philosophy, art, and psychology, or meeting, dating, and marrying my husband (who has stuck by my side for 9 years, despite all the pain I've put him through; he deserves better), the places we've traveled and the people I've met. It's the eating-disordered thoughts and behaviours, the effort I put into maintaining those behaviours, the hospitalizations and how sick I've been and all those times I've nearly died, the food, god, the food... the analysis, the numbers, the compensation.

My weight has stuck around \~85lbs for the past 2 months. I'm eating less than 1000kcal/day, with some ""limit""/goal of 1200.  This isn't normal, or sustainable. My heart rate is low 40s, my bone marrow is depleted, my white cell count is low so my immune system is shit. I just got out of 5 weeks in hospital for my heart fucking up. I have a meal plan, but it's really hard to stop thinking in terms of calories. I want the freedom of zooming out, away from the numbers and just keep things simple.

I don't want to live like this anymore, and recently I've been experimenting with normalcy; this week, I'm normalizing having 2 slices of bread at a meal (either 2 slices of toast at breakfast, or a sandwich for lunch/dinner), eating within an hour after waking up in the morning, and getting the bus instead of walking (free transit this week, no excuse). It's getting better, I think;  I can feel my way of thinking shifting a bit, though I know I need to keep plowing forward and not hesitate or look back.

It's time to let go. Wish me luck, please, I guess.

So a few years ago when I was 14, back when I had kik and was part of a shit ton of proana chats(I was in the early stages of developing an Ed and didn't know any better)

This ""girl"" pms me talking up this doctor that helped her lose like 30 pounds, and sends before and after pics, telling me that I should contact him, and he'll help me lose weight. I obviously don't buy it but go along with it because I've got nothing better to do. Besides! He only takes one client at a time, how could I miss such an opportunity?

*Unfortunately* this girl has to go to school or some shit, and as soon as she stops responding, our mysterious doctor contacts me! And so this dumb fuck tells me that by sticking a ballpoint pen in my ass cheek, I will be able to burn up to 3,000 cals in less than a day! And  I don't even have to break skin! I just poke my butt cheek with the pen and 3,000 cals instantly vaporized!

This dipshit even had a whole list of prices and how different pens burned different amount of cals, but out of the *kindness* of his heart, this absolute babe was offering to help me for free.

He asked for some pictures of pens, I complied. He asked me to choose one. I did. He stops responding. The girl from before checks up on me, asks me how I like him or some shit. I tell her everything is great! Can't wait to lose this weight! She reminds me that everything is going to work out great and then I'll have that perfect hot bod. Oh oops! She's stopped responding. But at least my *favorite* doc is back.

He makes sure to remind me that this is legit. Of *course* it is! How could I doubt him? So this darling tells me that he does have to go on video call to instruct me on how to poke this ballpoint pen into my(left) bare ass cheek in order for me to experience the miracle calorie burning.

Pure shitpost, fam. Just need to throw my bullshit out into the Universe. The other night I was on a date and I had an epiphany. I've put back on a bit of weight (ayyyy, recoverayy!), and I think I am the most repulsive human to walk this earth. Hawt. Yet this guy was hot, fit, and he seemed to like me. He kept telling me how hot he thought I was! SCORE. And my response to this... was to get drunk and tell him all about how fat I've gotten, how I USED to be sewhawt, why I am a terrible, boring as FUCK person, and how no one sane could POSSIBLY find me attractive. I'm ugly and not that fun hahaha^^^lovemeplz. Hot, amiright? To the surprise of literally no one, there was no second date... 




ANYWHO, I'll get to the point. When I was obese, no one wanted to date me. When I lost a bit of weight, guys showed me more interest, but no body wanted to date me. So I lost more weight. Lather, rinse, repeat. At my lowest weight, yeah some guys were keen to fuck me. But no one wanted to date me. Say what? 




I spent a lot of time, looking around me and seeing women who (in my fucked mind) were much, much larger than me, and they were all in happy relationships. How??? I always thought once I was skinny enough, someone would finally love me. Nearly starved to death waiting to be skinny enough to be loved. 




Well, turns out hating yourself is unattractive as fuck, and being a negative hoe doesn't inspire positive attention. Whoda thunk it. 




TL;DR
It's really hard to find someone to love you, if you can't even fathom the thought of loving yourself, so guess I'm gonna die alone. ",Shitpost,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/b1spe0/being_skinny_wont_make_you_pretty_if_youre_ugly/

So I‚Äôve had a bad day. Week. Month. Year. Whatever. So I decided to binge for lunch. I ordered a Mac and cheese and the lady gave me a medium instead of the small with a big smile on her face. I immediately started cursing this woman in my head. How dare she?! But now later on I‚Äôm reflecting on it a bit more. She was doing something nice for me, she tried to brighten my day with something that a healthier person would have enjoyed. I called this woman, internally, all sorts of vile names even though she was only trying to be kind. And I knew this Mac and cheese would end up in the toilet anyway. I tried to justify my anger at her by saying that she didn‚Äôt know if I had a health concern, but really, even if I did there‚Äôs no real harm a medium Mac and cheese can do that a small wouldn‚Äôt have. 

Now I‚Äôm thinking on other times I‚Äôve done this. Friends and family I‚Äôve put down for repeatedly inviting me out to dinner when all they wanted to do was spend time with me. The bartender who gave me an extra lime because he thought I was cute. The girl in the office that left candy on my desk because she saw me crying earlier. 

All of these people were only trying to be sweet to me but my disorder demonized them because of my own unhealthy thoughts and coping mechanisms. I think this is an important distinction to make. We don‚Äôt want the world to become as bitter and disillusioned as we have. I know I want everyone to be a little nicer to each other, and if this is how people show it, maybe I‚Äôm the one who is wrong. I need to rethink some things and address that these are my issues to work through. I need to be mad at my disorder for making me feel this way instead of innocent people who are only trying to brighten my day. 

All that being said, there is a gray area. That guy who gave you regular coke instead of diet is an asshole. He doesn‚Äôt know if your diabetic. The girl that gave you a dirty look for politely refusing a free sample is a bitch, she turned her politeness into rudeness. The server at chipotle who ruined your burrito with a heaping mass of extra guacamole and sour cream is doing a disservice to the burrito eating community because no one wants a soggy wet burrito with 8 mouthfuls of mush. 

But in some situations I think we as disordered individuals need to take a step back from the situation and evaluate why certain things make us feel the way that they do. Is our anger and frustration justified? Or is our disorder just unhappy with the situation? 

I know I‚Äôm guilty of letting my eating disorder turning me into a cold bitter person at times. And I need to reflect on that a bit more. Just something to think about. ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/b8ozt0/be_mad_at_the_disorder_not_other_people/

Under

*VERY CAREFUL*

MEDICAL SUPERVISION!!!!!

AS PART OF A UNIVERSITY STUDY!!!!!!!!!

*Not* drinking fucking snake juice and fainting!!!!!

I mean, the fast was successful overall, and it‚Äôs still pretty remarkable. Buut when people anecdotally bring him up, they almost always neglect to mention that:

1) He weighed 456 lbs when this began. 456 LBS YALL. If Google hasn‚Äôt lied to me, that‚Äôs 206.838 kg. 

So like...this guy wasn‚Äôt chubby or even plain old fat?! Which is, um...an important detail here perhaps...?

He was obese. He was straight up morbidly obese. He had a lot (A LOT) of fat to burn, and that fast *still* carried significant risks!!

2) WHICH IS WHY he regularly visited a HOSPITAL for bloodwork, EKGs, multivitamins, *medically supervised* electrolyte supplementation etc.

3) Although he did reach his ideal weight and miraculously maintained it afterwards, jumping right from consistent overeating to consistent literal starving did NOT magically make him SUPER HEALTHY!! Haha, wow!!! WHAT AN ABSOLUTE SHOCKER.

4) In fact, he died at the age of 51. In 1990.

It was so fucking good you guys. Every other time in my life when I‚Äôve eaten something that made me go over my calories or isn‚Äôt healthy I say fuck it and binge, or over exercise to purge.

I always jog at least 10 minutes, but my brain won't let me stop until the numbers on the screen are 'perfect' (like the calories burned, miles walked, time elapsed). For example, if I ran 10 minutes but my calories burn is at 89 then I have to keep going until it's a perfect 100 calories. If by then the time elapsed is 12 minutes 48 seconds then I gotta keep going until it's a rounded perfect 15 minutes. Same thing for distance, it has to be a whole mile or half a mile increment. 

My proudest moment was achieving 300 calories burnt in 40 minutes having run 3.5 miles EXACTLY. It's so satisfying to my fuked up lizard brain. 

I've been on the treadmill for up to 2 hours before just trying to get that 'perfect trio' of numbers. I'll treat it like a game, even, messing with the speed and incline to try and match the numbers so that they're pleasing to me.

(SO will rub my belly when it gets round, bebes laugh sometimes and it‚Äôs cute, finding out what music they‚Äôll like will be fun, feeding them seems like it‚Äôll be sweet sometimes, etc.) And my mom and grandmothers stayed very slim during and after all their pregnancies so that makes me feel a bit less panicky.

I‚Äôm gonna eat 1200+ and stop going HAM at the gym every single day now that I know what‚Äôs up. It‚Äôll be tough for the first few months but I know this is what‚Äôs best for both me and the alien bean.

This used to be such a big fear of mine. I hated shopping because I take so long and would often panic and buy stuff I didn't even want. Then something magical happened. I started working at a grocery store.

holy SHIT do we not care what you do. So here's the thing, 99% of the time, the check out people don't suspect anything, Your cart could be full of diet soda, laxatives, sugar free syrup, tea, any of the grim necessities, and the cashier wouldn't notice. The 1% of the time they notice, it's because that person also has an ED. For instance, I notice, but it's not because i'm judging you, it's because I feel some solidarity with you. I've asked my coworkers before if they notice weird carts, and they do not. 

Another thing. People come into the store and spend HOURS there. They eat tons of samples and wander around aimlessly. People without ED's. We don't care, it does not stand out. 

Literally the only thing we remember about a customer at the end of the workday, if anything, is how they treated us. If you're an asshole we're remember you. If you're especially kind and chatty we might remember you too. If you just come and go, even if you're spending a long time or buying a lot of 'suspicious' stuff, we won't remember you.

So here's my advice. Take a deep breath, take your time, ask any questions you want to (I promise, no one will judge), and go on your merry way. Grocery  shopping fear is valid, but it's easier once you accept that there's no real reason for it.",Victories,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dxh9hb/i_dont_know_who_needs_to_hear_this_but/

03-26-2019 06:10:46,b5kjts,26,Some things that happen when you have an eating disorder,False,False,False,365,False,0.99,False,"I wanted to jot down some of my thought patterns. I've been trying to understand what drives my ED for years, it keeps changing & morphing: 

&#x200B;

\- feeling pride, comfort, or elation when you realize you‚Äôve gone X hours without eating. Feeling a heightened sense of pride when you realize during those X hours, you didn‚Äôt even think of food.¬†

\- substituting actual successes with eating disorder successes. When you have a nonproductive day at work, thinking¬†‚ÄúWell at least I ate below 500cal today, so the day isn‚Äôt a complete failure‚Äù. Slowly the eating disorder successes start to take over in place of actual success and becomes your life. The world gets smaller with an eating disorder.¬†

\- being unable to sustain a romantic relationship because there is no one who will love you as intensely, as passionately, as closely as your disorder. The allure of sex pales in comparison to thinking about the food you‚Äôll allow yourself to eat after the next hour and forty-four minutes pass. 

\- breaking up with someone because they distract you from maintaining your relationship with your disorder. They try to help you because they care about you, but you reject them. Having a decreased sex drive because your body is starving and your BMI is 15.8.¬†

\- feeling superhuman when you watch other people eat. Because if you need less resources, if you‚Äôre different than the fools who need food to survive, what are you but superhuman, above it all?¬†

\- clinging to your disorder because it gives you an identity, albeit a pointless one. Feeling like you haven‚Äôt accomplished enough, that you aren‚Äôt important enough, that you‚Äôre not good enough compared to everyone else - and thus you don‚Äôt have an identity to call your own. You‚Äôre not yet ‚Äúthe record holder for X sport‚Äù or¬†‚Äúthe Pulitzer prize winning journalist‚Äù or¬†‚Äúthe bestselling author‚Äù or ""the scientist with 3 published papers"". So you embrace your disorder because at least you‚Äôll be¬†‚Äúthe skinny and ... sort of successful X‚Äù¬†

\- seeing a super thin girl walk past you in the subway station and being unsure if you‚Äôre attracted to girls, or if you just want her body specifically. Trying not to appear as ""creepy"" by continuing to stare at her thigh gap and the bit of collarbone that‚Äôs showing under her blouse.¬†Looking away when she meets your eyes briefly, and now you know that she knows that you know - that you are both wasting away. 

\- seeing a super thin girl walk past you and becoming competitive with her internally. 

\- when your bones start to lose density and you can feel the aches when you‚Äôre trying to go to bed and you contemplate starting melatonin because you have to wake up at 6am for work the next day

\- infiltrating the world of keto dieters, vegans, marathon runners, ballet dancers, people who fast for health or clearer thinking ‚Ä¶ because then you somewhat fit in. Browsing r/fasting or r/1200isplenty or r/intermittentfasting because you‚Äôre trying to fool yourself into thinking what you‚Äôre doing has a silver lining. 

\- lying to yourself by thinking that once you hit X weight, all your problems will magically be solved.¬†

\- developing avoidant attachment style because the moment you let someone in, they destroy the illusion of control you have over your life that your disorder grants you.",Discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/b5kjts/some_things_that_happen_when_you_have_an_eating/

I'm currently the biggest I've ever been in my adult life and I feel like a total heffer, but hey, this cow got game! 

I grabbed my zero calorie Monster, sauntered my legging-clad ass up to the register, he smiled, complimented me for a third time and smiled and I thought ""What the fuck have I got to lose?"".

She is a SWEETHEART and a beautiful person and is currently working on her PhD at an Ivy. 

She's a very picky eater. Not like she stuffs her face with ice cream or fries or whatever, but we went to this vegan place, she orders a kale salad and ate two bites and stopped eating it. I got donuts and she would eat only three bites and stop eating. Then all of our group went to a restaurant and the waitress forced us into a tiny booth. Her stomach was over the table. I felt extremely bad and said ""my hips are way too wide for the table, do you guys want to move somewhere else?"". I saw her struggling walking up this hill in the city and told everyone, ""I'm super down for coffee right now!"" because I saw a coffee shop close by with a bunch of seats.

I went to check on her and she was sitting at the bar at top and said that the music was too loud, and I had to play along like ""yeah...my ears are ringing too!"" like I was not aware why she needed to sit down. 

I felt like I had to be an advocate for her in secret but it triggered me so much because I felt like the fat friend. Like I was the one who needed to do all of that and make excuses for myself.

I was always that fat girl and this is not the first time people have talked shift about fat people in front of me and then talked about how beautiful I am. I don't know if I can date cause I'm honestly way too fucekd up this happens every time. hahahah I'm skinny but I'm sick everybody. i look good but I'm sick I'm not ok I'm not well I need help but everybody praises this.

My professor is my faculty advisor, I've taken loads of classes with her, and we're very close. She's made references before to how skinny I am but I try to just ignore them. When I proposed this piece I specifically said it was about autonomy and self-sufficiency. Eating disorders never came up. So imagine my surprise when during the crit, in front of the entire class of 16 people or so, my prof goes, ""We can't ignore the way this image invokes eating disorders, you know, it makes you think about starvation.""

It literally doesn't??? I just had to stand in front of the class for fifteen minutes talking about eating disorders pretending like they don't affect me.

06-21-2019 19:14:19,c3clsy,16,working in an office has made me fall off the recovery wagon. TW maybe?,False,False,False,351,False,0.99,False,"This turned into a long story but I need to get off my chest.


I'm 26. I work in a fairly big office with lots of different people.
There is usually always food brought in for lunch, from snacks to chocolate, cake, pies, etc. For the most part, I was recovered. I could enjoy these things in small doses without panicking. I was a healthy BMI and maintaining my silent recovery. You see, nobody knew as I didn't really feel comfortable talking about it, does anybody really? I feel that's part of the reason. 


A few months ago, because one of the bigger girls in the office was going on holiday and getting married, she decided to put on a ""weight loss challenge"" for the office, designed to get healthy! Lose weight! Win some money! There was an entry fee of ¬£2 each so the prize money ended up being about ¬£50 for whoever lost the most amount of weight (% wise from overall.) 


How could I resist entering? I tried to kid myself that I was better now, I could manage it, it's just for the money, it would be handy and I could get straight back to recovering, I mean I'm already at a healthy BMI, it won't hurt to lose a few, plus it's % based so I don't have to lose a lot to be able to win compared to the others. It was scary, weighing in front of her, to privately record the weight loss on her chart as the organiser, but I managed and I was proud. ""You look like you weigh less than what you do!"" Um, thanks? The thoughts had started in the back of my mind..I need to lose more, the scale should show less, thats embarrassing. But I cut that thought short. I'm better now, after all.


 It started off well, just cutting back a small amount of calories, not having as big a breakfast, maybe I'll skip lunch because I'm not that hungry, it's spring, I can have salad for dinner.. until I didn't eat for 3 days, with flimsy excuses to myself that I let myself believe.. all the while comments from others in the office saying how much will power I have, how strong and commited I am. Fueling me.


Then the bitchy comments started about two weeks in. When I refused the offered slice of cake as a celebration for making it two weeks. (Half way) ""You're skinny anyway you don't need to take it as seriously as the rest of us"" ""you're already in first place with the most lost so far, treat yourself!"" ""Skinny bitch hahaha just kidding."" (No Sarah. I know you weren't kidding. But I'm not mad, I secretly relished your jealousy.) ""you're making me feel bad for eating this hehehe"" as the bride to be shoves a third slice of cake down. So, feeling guilty and realising I'm probably going too far down the rabbit hole, walking too close to that edge, hearing that voice inside telling me how easy it would be, to come back.. I accepted the slice of cake. I don't want to go back to my old ways, if I can just go back to normal now I will be fine, two weeks of a slip up doesn't break recovery. I thought. I take a bite of cake. Laughter. ""She's not that strict after all! We might have a chance to win yet!"" Sabotage? I laugh along, internally I'm panicking. I head to the toilet. I purge. And purge. And cry. The beginning of the end.


The comments kept coming. Jokes, laughs, its all a bit of fun. They don't realise what they're doing. At least, I hoped not. How could they? They don't know. And it's my fault. 


I ended up winning the challenge. No one bats an eye, or thinks that for a month, the amount of weight I lost, seems like a lot. Maybe it doesn't, to them? Maybe I'm not small enough yet? I just did it for the money. That's all.


Of course, the challenge is over now. Everybody's moaning how they've put X amount of lbs back on. ""Hey, want some doughnuts?"" I shake my head. ""The challenge is over now! We don't have to diet!"" I laugh. I'm not hungry, I already had a big lunch. Lies tumbling from my mouth as if I never had a 9 month recovery. The longest I've had between some form of disordered eating. Of course they wouldn't know. I didn't tell them. I'm at a healthy BMI after all. This is all they've seen me as, in this new job. 


I'm not skinny enough for them to think to worry about, because it's just me, I eat healthy, I look after my body. Or, for a little while, I did.


Help, I've fallen, and I'm scared. Why won't somebody notice this is not normal. Ah, that's right. It's my fault, they don't know, and I'm never going to tell them.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/c3clsy/working_in_an_office_has_made_me_fall_off_the/

I've gone through periods of high restriction and general insanity in my diet. When I'm at worst people see me at my best. 

When I'm restricting I'm a different person. Restricting 3cats is: 
- hotter 
- more confident 
- more outgoing 
- full of energy (shout out to stimulants) 
- getting chores done, manic cleaning 
- social
- happy, smiling, out going 
- down for sex 

I mean that's what I'm presenting. I'm still a depressed mess but it's not what I put out. People tell me ""3cats, have you lost weight? Look at your face!"" My girlfriend will tell me how much happier I seem, how proud of me she is... (lol) 

People encourage and feed into disordered eating without realizing it and it just fuels it for me so bad. I don't give a shit about myself and what I do to my body really. So if other people think what I'm doing if good and beneficial to them fuck it imma do that.

I don't know y'all. I need a smoke

Edit; 

I read a lot all the responses to this post and have some mixed feelings about it. I'm glad people identify with me. I want to be clear that this isn't what I want for my life. Yes I'm more peppy and I'm feeling good but, as commenters have pointed out, that's what being mid addiction feels like. Alcoholics can justify their drinking because it makes them more social, they go out, they use it as stress Relief.. ect ect. 

It scares me looking at my life the way it is, I want to have a normal relationship with food and with my body. The ED on my shoulder whispers this kind of crap to me letting me sink deeper.  

If I can be all these things over tired, sore, hungry, on edge, anxious around my friends, abstaining form foods that bring my joy, reliant of caffeine and substances to medicate almost daily. I sure as hell can do that recovered or at least as close to that as possible. 

I after reading over my post I debated deleting as frankly I see I am glorifing my disordered habits. But I think it's important to recognize that the reason so many of us struggle with this is how you can't see how sick you are when you focus on all the results. It makes it easier to look over all the fucked up aspects of your life. 

I guess I had a very sobering smoke.

idk if it‚Äôs just me but that mentality makes me kind of sad. like,,
you can have a pizza. it doesn‚Äôt mean you had an ‚Äúoff day‚Äù or a ‚Äúcheat,‚Äù all it means is that you chose to have a pizza... and letting yourself relax and enjoy something shouldn‚Äôt immediately be classified as binge eating. even if it were because OP was stressed, i don‚Äôt know if that automatically means that it‚Äôs an emotional eating problem that needs to be addressed...

i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm also a huge hypocrite because as someone with an ED it is really hard for me to practice what i preach. but i truly feel like the attitudes that are expressed on those subs are so militaristic and black and white about food. so much of ED recovery is intuitive eating and realizing that no food is ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúgood‚Äù‚Äî food is just food...
the comments just rubbed me the wrong way i guess. maybe i‚Äôm too sensitive

1. Not kidding: I *never* think about food. Like, unless it's like ""should I put basil in my caprese salad or should I go to the garden and clip mint to be a lil extra."" or ""should I take my partner to romantic restaurant A or B?""
2. Similar to #1, I don't find food interesting anymore. I don't want to see people's food on instagram or watch videos about food or browse the grocery isle for hours, or read menus on my spare time.
3. If I eat 5 cookies, I don't call it a binge. I merely ate 5 fucking cookies. It's okay to eat 5 cookies. Maybe not every day because #health but like 5 cookies is not a big deal. 
4. I don't measure my peanut butter. Or olive oil. Or anything else with fat content. Y'all ANs know what I'm talking about and know this is a big fucking deal.
5. I can have food in the house and not eat it all at once. I can have all kinds of food and genuinely just not think about it or remember it's there. The other day I **remembered** I had honey that I can put on my yogurt.
6. I don't eat till I feel like I'm about to explode. Well... I have, at a wedding buffet. But it's not a regular thing. I eventually realize I'm full, but it's not even a conscious thought, it's more like ""empty plate, wash empty plate.""
7.  When I feel hungry, it doesn't feel unbearably painful anymore, because I'm eating regularly anyway. It's more like ""I'm hungry, but meh I'll wait since I'm eating dinner in an hour anyway.""
8. I don't really want the dessert, all the time. If I eat a filling meal, I don't really want ice cream after. I'm full and content (!?!?!? Still struggling to believe this feeling exists after meals)
9. I can't finish meals that I used to eat ***multiple*** of. If I get a veggie burger, I can't finish it, whereas before I used to eat the veggie burger, and plate of fries, and eat 3 brownies, then follow that with a whole bag of chex mix or some other snack, and ice cream later.
10. My usual breakfast is 600-800 calories: more calories than what I allowed myself for an entire day (when restricting). Part 2: I didn't know this till writing this post and thinking about it because I don't count my calories.

&#x200B;

Things that still suck that I'm still struggling with:

1. Hearing a person of any size tell me how they think they're fat or should lose weight triggers me.
2. Hearing a person of any size tell me how they skip a meal, or how they ""have no appetite, or when people talk about their eating habits in general, positive or negative in any way triggers the FUCK out of me.
3. Hearing the word ""binge"" even if about ""binge-watching"" a TV show or in any other normal context. 
4. Clothes shopping....... (AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH). And being made aware of the appearance of my body in any way, positive or not.
5. Though I don't think that I'm fat anymore, and I KNOW that I'm not fat, I still don't love my body really, I just feel neutral towards it.

Fucking shit, Susan. I don‚Äôt hate you for being fat. I hate myself for being fat because I believe I am worthless in general. I don‚Äôt believe *everyone* is worthless in general! It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm a piece of shit.

It just baffles me because I feel like people tend to be at least *a little* less shitty when it comes to lots of other mental illnesses, but suddenly you‚Äôre a goddamn lepur if you‚Äôre at all open about struggling with an ED (or an addiction for that matter).

I had a starbucks reward for a free food or drink item of my choice, and thought this would be a good opportunity to ease into eating food I didn't make myself. I spent two weeks picking which specific food item I was going to eat. Finally, I placed the order through the mobile app. When I went to pick it up the cashier told me they had just sold out and didn't have any more, but they could offer me a different food or beverage of my choice.

I should mention that I'm in exams right now and had some other personal stressors today that were overloading my brain. Maybe it was the stress, the hypoglycemia, or the fatigue from not sleeping, but I just lost it. I stepped away from the counter and  started sobbing- I couldn't stop, something broke inside me. Like, full-on ugly crying in the middle of a food court. A stranger came up to me and asked me if I was OK. The barista ended up finding the item in the back fridge for me, but it didn't matter because when I got home my family surprised me with thousands of calories of cake and pie and fudge that I binged on (and purged after they left, but it had been so long that I definitely didn't get it all and I hate myself). 

I hate this disorder so much, you guys. Before my ED I would have just picked a fucking different food item and gone on my merry way. But now my life revolves around these obsessive anxieties, number crunching, bizarre food rules that don't even make sense. I'm always hungry but I hate feeling full. I'm irritable and inconsiderate.

There are a few possibilities why they say that: 
1. They probably eat one huge meal a day and overestimate how much they eat and feel full too quickly therefore they feel like they eat too much
2. They literally might have a fast metabolism
3. They naturally have low appetite signals so even if they eat a normal amount they might feel tremendously full. 
4. They are trying to hide their eating disorder which may or not be aware of. 

First off, assuming they don't have disordered eating, they aren't ""eating three baby carrots a day"" if they maintained that figure for a while, they averaging a TDEE a little less than someone with a normal weight. For example, my UGW tdee of 17 bmi is 1400 calories. I am literally 30 pounds heavier and my tdee is only off by 150 calories. That is two oreos a day difference. They are literally eating the same amount of a normal healthy person by off by 100-300 calories, assuming they have similar exercise and they aren't severely underweight. They LITERALLY CANNOT be starving themselves unless they go through binge cycles.

And if they do suffer with an ED, why are we so bitter? We should show more empathy than project that they binge eat and just lie to others to make them feel bad. 

I know this is an ED safe space but we should monitor our toxic behavior towards other people who aren't even doing anything to us. 

There are people on here who DO NOT BINGE as surprisingly as that sounds. We shouldn't mock them or assume that they binge like most of us on here do.  Their thoughts and feelings are still valid and we shouldn't assume everyone binges and if theyre skinny and complain that they can't gain weight they're just rubbing it in our faces to make us feel jealous. This is unwelcoming and unsupportive.

If you still think that's impossible please browse /r/gainit or /r/xxgainit and see that people really struggle with getting their calories in or watch youtubers who talk about skinny shaming and how it affects their self esteem. 

They are NOT trying to rub it in our faces. If they are, they are obviously mentally ill and this should also serve as a safe space for them since they are struggling with an ED.

Some interesting sections:

>	Since my return from Belize some two months earlier, I had shed the fleshly equivalent of a small child. At 5‚Äô6‚Äù and a shade over 120 pounds, I had always hovered on the thin side of normal, but after my rapid post-Belize diminishment, the needle on the scale barely reached the 100 mark. My soft, slightly rounded physique had become all sharp angles and flat planes: prominent clavicles; concave abdomen; visible, countable ribs.

>i have to admit that, in the beginning at least, as the weight began to fall away, I enjoyed my metamorphosis. All those epithets we‚Äôve coined to describe annoying areas of recalcitrant flesh‚Äîbat wings, back fat, love handles, muffin tops‚Äîno longer applied to me. I remember standing beneath the harsh fluorescent lights in the dressing room at Saks and thinking, Give me tight! Give me diaphanous! Give me sleeveless! For the first time since I was a teenager, I could take a photograph in which I did not appear to have Nixon-like jowls. I began to look more frequently in mirrors. So thoroughly had I internalized our culture‚Äôs idolization of the very thin that I was secretly pleased by a weight loss I knew had to have sinister roots.

>	Studies have shown that in the minds of those predisposed to eating disorders, starvation often creates a sense of euphoria by altering the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. In my experience, notable weight loss in the absence of caloric deprivation engenders a similar feeling. Even as I worried I might truly be dying, I relished being exceedingly thin. How fabulous to be able to eat whatever I want and not gain a pound! How demented, under the circumstances, to have this thought at all.

On men‚Äôs new attention:

>	if I was paying an inordinate amount of attention to my new silhouette, this was nothing compared to the attention it was getting from others. Many men, I quickly learned, really do like frighteningly lean women, whatever they may claim to the contrary. As an average, medium-size young woman, I was unremarkable, innocuous. As a skinny slip of a thing, I was something of a sensation. In restaurants and at parties, men flirted with me extravagantly. 

>	But while blindingly blond hair and cartoonishly large breasts are fetishized symbols of an obvious, stereotypical sort of femininity, I was surprised to discover that near-emaciation also invites the proverbial male gaze. Do so many men really fancy women with the curves of a prepubescent boy? Apparently so. And why not? Men also live in a culture that, for reasons not entirely clear, prizes dollsize celebrities on the one hand and gazelle-like models on the other. Their ideals of beauty have also been formed by such images. (As a male friend once put it to me, semifacetiously, ‚ÄúA little anorexia is hot.‚Äù)

On her coworkers and other women: 

>	I grew paranoid. I fretted that my friends and colleagues thought I was willfully ravaging my body, and I tried to demonstrate otherwise every chance I got. At restaurants, I made sure to eat heartily regardless of whether I felt hungry. If sweets were offered during meetings‚Äîthose ever-present birthday cakes!‚ÄîI made a show of devouring some. Once, after I had grown gaunt enough to prompt a remark that I looked ‚Äúlike Anne Frank,‚Äù I bought a giant, gooey cinnamon roll, the sort consumed by travelers in Midwestern airports, and polished it off during an editorial meeting. (I‚Äôm sure I looked bulimic.) I was behaving like one of those emaciated starlets who gorges on McDonald‚Äôs for the benefit of the press while claiming a ‚Äúfast metabolism‚Äù between mouthfuls.

On her doctor:

>	And what if I had been anorexic? The irony, of course, is that although he [my doctor] may have diagnosed my disorder‚Äîwithout ever dignifying it by speaking its name‚ÄîI still would not have received proper treatment. Some Victorian-era rest cure consisting of fatty foods (the sort of therapy Virginia Woolf was forced to submit to) is hardly the answer for a twentysomething woman fearful of gaining weight. Nor is telling the patient to ‚ÄúJust eat, just get over it‚Äù as though the disease were a question of a quick change of mind and not a quirk of disordered brain chemistry.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/buvu9x/fashion_writer_explains_her_experiences_with/

The way I organized the data is in chunks of 5000 posts per HTML file. The file names give the date range of the posts in the format (year-month-day-hour-minute).

I also have the comment data for both subs, however it'll be much more difficult to format and so will take a bit longer as I'll need to build a comment tree system.

12-17-2019 05:53:10,ebqggc,6,It's been three hours since I found out that the body I starved myself to look like never existed,False,False,False,327,False,0.99,12-16-2019 22:09:47,"Last year I dated a guy who would every once in a while go from love-bombing me to giving me the cold shoulder and chase after a girl from a nearby country he's obsessed with. I never met her, but I spent an insane amount of time on her instagram account, memorising all of her pictures and stories so that I could take pictures of myself from the same angles and compare our bodies. I thought that I deserved to be treated badly by the guy if I, at my then upper healthy weight, was bigger than her.

The thing that made it near impossible for me to reach a conclusion (aside from my BDD) was that this girl is a master at angles. Despite her instagram being filled with pictures of her, I could never get a grasp on what her body really looked like, because it would always be partly covered by objects or people. 

After a while my brain supposedly got tired of this and decided she was much skinnier than me, even after I had been told the contrary by a brutally honest friend. So I started restricting. I spent hours a day recreating all of her full body photos. Over and over again, since my body was shrinking and I was fixated on the need for new, up-to-date comparisons every other day. Going as far as finding similar outfits to what she wore for it to be as accurate as possible. I had no hobbies at this point except talking to the guy, counting calories and obsessing over the girl.

It's been six months and even with this eating disorder now taking up a huge part of my life I'm still in a better place than back then. I've picked up some old hobbies, and I recently got the most amazing boyfriend one could ever ask for, who looks at me as if I was the sun itself and practices on confessing his love for me when he thinks I'm too asleep to remember it the next morning. I'm sick, and it's a daily battle, but I have faith that things can, and will, get better. Despite everything, I feel like a very lucky girl since I have now been blessed with this much love and joy in life.

However.
Old habits really do die hard. I still can't get myself to stop looking at the girl's instagram. Not even to compare myself anymore ‚Äì by now I know that I am smaller than her, and more importantly, that it doesn't matter; the guy was an asshole and we are both beautiful in our own ways. But it's like I couldn't let go of it until I had finally solved the mystery. I needed closure.

Today I got recommended a picture in which the girl had been tagged. No flattering angles. No tactically placed objects.

Just her. Unfiltered. Pretty, as always. And much bigger than I've ever been.

It's been three hours since I found out that the body I starved myself to look like never existed, and I still haven't been able to identify my feelings for it.

I'm not happy, or triumphant, or even proud. Nor do I feel sorrow or frustration for developing a potentially life-threatening disorder over an illusion (delusion?). 

Perhaps it's just a relief so immense that I have no previous experience to compare it to. Come to think of it, it truly does feel like a mountain has been lifted of my chest. I have found my closure. I can now have peace.

Edit: Some awkward phrasing. There's probably more since I wrote this in the middle of the night and English isn't my native language, but I think it's time for me to get some rest.

As someone who has been fat most of their life, then became thin (-50 lbs) for a year, THEN GOT EVEN FATTER (+70 lbs)... I can tell you...  there was no better feeling than waking up thin. Waking up thin and not worrying about how clothes were going to fit. Waking up thin and not worrying about if I would see anyone that I knew and if they would see how fucking fat I've gotten. Waking up thin and knowing I could take a good selfie without running it through 200 filters to hide how much fucking weight I've gained since my friends last saw me.

So many fucking problems in my life circle around my constant struggle with being overweight. My mental health improved, my self image improved, and my morale improved. I was SO much happier. In fact, so much so, that my disordered eating was next to non-existent.

So anyways, I want to reflect back to this community something that I've noticed a lot of people say, which I think is a distortion but rarely gets called out as such: 1200 calories is not ""maintenance."" 1200 calories per day is a serious deficit for everyone except maybe my 4 foot 10 grandmother who sits in her chair all day watching her programs with the thermostat cranked up to 90.

It is typical for people to be hungry/feel like shit/get triggered to binge from eating 1200 calories per day. 1200 calories is not ""enough"" for almost anyone.

Thought it was important to call this out because whether you're still in the thick of it or headed towards recovery, the idea that 1200 should be ""enough"" for you is bound to add insult to injury by making you think you should ""be fine"" with an amount of food that will almost certainly leave you malnourished... And the other diet subs also perpetuate the idea and normalize it (don't even get me started on how disordered I think the other diet subs are...and how at least you guys arent deluding yourselves about what it is that you're doing...but that's another story).

So anyways, if you're eating 1200 or so, that's great if it's a step in the right direction for you....but it's not ""maintenance."" It's not like, ok you're eating ""enough"" now so you should feel fine now. If you still feel hungry and shitty and bingey at that level, that's expected. It's not a moral failing on your part.

that's how long it was. that's how long i made it. four years without purging. four years. four. fucking. years. and then one day, out of the blue, i eat my lunch at work. everything is going fine. and then i get up from my desk, walk to the bathroom, and make myself throw up, then go back to my desk.

and i sit there. and i type type type and answer the phone and it doesn't even fucking occur to me what i did until twenty minutes later, i feel the familiar sick tremble all through my body. what the... fuck? what the fuck did i just do? why did i just do that? it wasn't even a lot of food. it wasn't every heavy. it was under 400 calories, that's for sure. oh my god, what the fuck did i just do?

holy shit. okay. it's fine. it happens, right? it's fineit'sfineit'sfine the streak isn't over it was a fluke, it was a fluke it was two months then three months and why am i back here? what the fuck happened? WHY AM I BACK HERE WHY AM I BACK HERE? WHY AM I BACK HERE AND WHY DID I EVER TALK ABOUT BEING IN RECOVERY BECAUSE NOW I'M NOT AND EVERYONEWILLKNOWTHATIFUCKINGFAILEDAGAIN.

okay, okay, so. okay so. deep breath. i lost 65lbs down from my highest i've ever been and i did it slow, i did it safe, i counted calories and i never underate and i started climbing mountains with my husband and running 3x a week and lifting and i look good, feel good, it all felt so so good. everything was sunshine and flowerbuds on trees, long walks and self love and yeah okay my body is still *disgusting* and i'm still a fucking fat piece of shit with loose skin and sure i could have lost it all already (i go back and forth every day, should it be 15 more pound? 25? 30?) if i had any fucking self control but no matter what i did or didn't do i didn't fucking purge nope i did not i did not.

until i did, and i don't know why, and that is the scariest part because i am back down at the bottom of the well and i cannot figure out how i got here. okay, okay, so, okay, maybe i triggered myself by trying out intermittent fasting as a way to get rid of those last goddamned pounds because sure i climb mountains as a hobby but do i have to be so *fat* about it? and god i'm a size 8 but everyone knows  today's size 8 is really a size 12 anyway so i'm still in double digits and that's just, it's not okay. okay and maybe the sensation of eating larger meals wasn't right with me and maybe that's when it happened, because that day in the office i'd just eaten at 2pm for the first time that day (it felt g o o o d to wait and wait and wait some more, powerful and strong).

five years. i was going to reward myself with five years clean by finally, finally going to the dentist. i know my front teeth are rotting out but i'm not in constant pain -- except the headaches, the headaches started and you can *feel* the way they start in the teeth i know have needed to come out for years. every time i thought about the dentist and the judgment and tsk tsk (like the hairdresser, always with the comments about my poor broke ass using at-home dye fuck you jillian when i do it it costs me $15) every fucking time i just shuddered and put it out of my mind until 5 years approached and i though what a treat, it'll be better now. 

but on new year's eve i drank too much and got too honest with my husband and i sobbed and i told him everything and i don't think he gets it. i don't think he gets why i asked him if he knew how to take out the garbage disposal. or why i have baking soda in my bathroom. why we suddenly have *so much fucking food in the house*. why i spend all night looking at recipes to cook and all morning at work talking about food and going back on forth on what i'm going to make. but i told him, i told him, i fucking told him and he knows and he asked me why i think it happened and i don't know.

how the fuck did i get back in this fucking hole i climbed out of?

my teeth are ruined. my stomach will never look normal. i will never be able to eat food without calculating and estimating and picking it apart and smiling politely when i decline the pear slice my work mom offers me because i'm saving my calories for a square of chocolate before bed and chew chew chew spit spit stashing food in every drawer at work. i think there was a little blood in my vomit the last time, god i love that raw, empty feeling. my stomach gurgles and my husband smiles because he doesn't know it's because i threw up the 426 calories i ate for dinner and then guzzled a liter of water. and my well meaning, sweetheart of a coworker think it's smart that i keep tabs of knorr's chicken broth base in my desk justincase i get lightheaded. 

so i email therapists because i've lost my way and i was so proud of my streak so fucking proud. and theydon'ttakemyinsurance they'reallfull nonewclients sorrynooneheredoesCBT it's closed door after closed door and finally i get on someone's waitlist and she cancels her practice and i twiddle my thumbs and think well fuck, i already have a weak heart and my teeth are ruined so maybe recovery was a lie this whole time and it was living inside of me, waiting for whatever it was that woke this fucking beast of a thing.

I‚Äôm glad this sub is growing as we welcome ED folk new to the sub and pick up lost proED refugees. But I think as time is passing and with new members, we‚Äôre becoming more lax with the rules.


This is just a reminder to:

* read the sub rules before posting! 

> I‚Äôm noticing people slipping up more and asking for tips to lose weight (esp drug related) or how to lie to health care professionals. This isn‚Äôt allowed and it jeopardises the sub‚Äôs existence in the eyes of reddit admin!

* be mindful of your wording!

> Sharing your messed up ED brain thoughts is ok as long as you can see how it‚Äôs messed up- those posts helps us realise how warped, competitive and potentially toxic our mentality and attitudes can be when we look at others. BUT remember we have ED folk of all BMI‚Äôs with all different ED types. We have normal/overweight/obese anorexics/bulimics/BED/OSFED etc! Be mindful and don‚Äôt put triggering/clickbait titles or demeaning generalisations




Big thanks to the people who report violating posts - it makes the mods‚Äô lives much easier as we try to moderate posts asap but life can get in the way.

So I upped my calories. We‚Äôre talking 3 huge square meals, carbs, good fats, proteins. No junk. From restricting at 500cals +/- b/p sessions, to 1400cals daily (above my TDEE). üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑

And hooooooly shit i felt terrible at first - pooped up, bloated, but I had the energy to study and do the exams to the best of my ability. Yes I regretted what I ate almost daily, even while I was eating it. But I didn‚Äôt b/p for 2 fuckin weeks!!! üíõ(Victory 1)



ANYWAY 2 days later and I‚Äôm hosting my 21st birthday at home. The theme is ‚Äúbad and boujee‚Äù (HAHA).

Picture me skiddaddling all over black friday sales to find a slinky lil number, and getting my hair bleached and curled, some sharp ass eyeliner wings, a bold red lip, clout sunnies.



You guys it was the best night ever. I had MAJOR DYSMORPHIA leading up to it. I had high school friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in years coming. I had the damned voice in my ear saying 

> ‚Äúhey they‚Äôre gonna notice you‚Äôve got fat lol, good luck with that‚Äù.

BUT I felt beautiful. I‚Äôve never felt beautiful in my life. The fairylights draping over my backyard and tiki torches and I felt goddam beautiful and drunk. 



Here‚Äôs a shameless list of victories and compliments I‚Äôve never gotten before:

* one of my male friends I‚Äôm not super close with yelled ‚ÄúAYE THEM CURVES‚Äù as I was posing lol, and like 30 of my guests were just standing around, admiring me lay down mermaid style with sass hahahah. I felt like a woman and not a hippo.

* I had the Hot Girl‚Ñ¢Ô∏è drunkenly tell me twice that I looked hot as fuck.

* One of my friends booped my nose and said I had the best nose. It‚Äôs small and chunky and kinda hooked and I usually hate it so it was a miracle to hear.

* Those old high school friends? I don‚Äôt mean to toot my horn but they had a starry-eyed look and told me I looked soooooo goooood.

* I had people compliment my hair, my earrings

* a Boy offered to keep me steady (I‚Äôm a major lightweight) as an excuse to hold my hand.....

* And I cried in the speeches. All these beautiful people I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve lived long enough to meet and call friends. A room full of people cheering and radiating with love and acceptance and family. I never felt so loved in the world, I felt invincible and vulnerable.

I‚Äôve struggled with depression for 6 years, suicidal desires daily for 3 years, I‚Äôve cut myself, binged, purged, punished myself, dealt with abuse from a narcissist mum...

But

I. Felt. Loved.

I. Felt. Beautiful.

And it‚Äôs a damn good feeling.

I was in such a good, sociable, anxiety-free mood flitting between my party guests that I didn‚Äôt even have the overwhelming urge to binge on all the food. Not to-fucking-day satan.



I‚Äôm rambling so if you read this far, thank you.

Here‚Äôs to all of you who lay in bed, not sure how to face the day daily.

Here‚Äôs to all of you who hate mirrors, shower in the cool darkness, and hate being physically touched.

Here‚Äôs to all of you who have suffered and hated yourself, torn between crying out and locking down into a hard shell of who you were.

Here‚Äôs to all of you who carry mountains that we were only meant to climb.

Here‚Äôs to tomorrow being a brand new start, a day to try again, to forgive yourself.

A fresh page, a new beginning.

My victory is your victory.

I love you.

I was very skinny as a child and family would always be like ‚Äúshe needs more meat on her bones‚Äù but whenever I hit puberty I gained a lot. If I were to weigh like 5lbs higher at my SW I would‚Äôve been overweight, that‚Äôs terrifying to me.
Anyways, around 6th grade I just remember this being the time I started being insecure about my body and stuff ‚Äî before that, I just didn‚Äôt care. And then after that, I internalized every single instance of anyone poking fun at me about my weight.

Such as:
‚Ä¢ when my grandpa was in the hospital, I got on the hospital elevator with my great grandma and there were people inside (about 3-4) and when we both got inside, my grandma said ‚Äúhope we both fit in here, she‚Äôs been getting so much bigger lately‚Äù 
‚Ä¢ having my mom ask me to weigh myself and being like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to‚Äù but did anyways. She told me ‚Äú123? You don‚Äôt look like you‚Äôd weigh that much.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ my best friend randomly asking me ‚Äúhow much do you weigh‚Äù after years of telling me how skinny I was
‚Ä¢ putting a bathing suit on and getting into the pool and having my sister say ‚Äúyou got fat‚Äù ‚Äî mind you, my sister is like 12 years old and weighs like 170 lbs so in my head I was like ‚Äúif she thinks I‚Äôm fat, then it must be really bad‚Äù
‚Ä¢ my 75 year old great grandma literally weighing the same as me in 7th grade
‚Ä¢ me about to break my fast and going into the fridge to browse when my brother says ‚Äúshe has a fat belly‚Äù and then me breaking into tears and going back to my room and then my grandma asking me what my problem is
‚Ä¢ hearing my brother say ‚Äúshe eats too much‚Äù when I went into the kitchen once

Meh there‚Äôs probably more but I can‚Äôt think of them right now. Literally all of this shit was said by family too (my friends comments weren‚Äôt even bad compared to the others) kinda sucks :(
Sorry if these seem kinda sissy-ish or weak but like I said I just internalize this shit

Edit: so many of you guys are commenting your experiences and so many, if not all of them are things that adults said to you as kids. First of all, why the fuck is that normalized so much? Why do grown ass adults find the need to comment on children‚Äôs weight? It makes me sick.

When someone shares their story of how somebody they are close to said something triggering there are often comments that proceed to insult the person who said the triggering thing. 

I just need to say that running someone‚Äôs partner, family, or friends through the coals is not helpful and it is hurtful. Obviously some people write their posts needing to angrily vent and can appreciate being sided with but I also see a lot of hate on normal explaining posts. 

It is more triggering for me to hear people on here tell me that my partner is a bad person or that my friends are idiots and I should dump them than it is for me to hear the triggering things from those people themselves. Why? Because feeling like I have horrible friends and family around me makes me feel more isolated and alone. These people are my support structure and they are my only reason to live and fight my ED. Idk, maybe I‚Äôm explaining this too deeply and the real thing thing I want to get across is simply that it hurts to hear someone say mean things about someone I love. It makes me feel guilty for posting my honest thoughts when I need support. 

I know people (usually) mean the best by the things they write on this site.

Throughout my disorder I‚Äôve always been overweight. It started out binge eating, I had gained weight from antidepressants and my mother tried to force me on diets. She would restrict my food intake and it just made everything worse. I would horde food and money and use it to buy more food at school. I remember my mom used to let me have 2 eggo waffles each morning. So I would make 4, quickly shove 2 in my mouth and chew as fast as I could so she didn‚Äôt catch me. 

I always had the stupid stereotypical thoughts about how I want to lose weight, ‚Äúmight as well just be anorexic.‚Äù It was so stupid of me to ever think that would work out. No matter how little I ate, I always binged and the scale went up. When that number went up, it‚Äôs like it correlated with my self hatred. I thought losing weight would help me love myself.

That was absolute bullshit. I‚Äôve struggled so much the last 6 years with absolutely nothing to show except for internal damage, and how the memories haunt me of my organs failing. I remember overdosing on diet pills and vyvanse in the school bathroom. They couldn‚Äôt even get an IV in me because my pulse was so strong, blood pressure 210/160. I remember having to consume 800mg of caffeine just to function and exercise, but never getting warm enough to stop my nails from turning blue. I remember going to the hospital because my kidneys were failing. What little urine I made was brown and smelled like burnt rubber. All because I couldn‚Äôt stop taking laxatives. 

And I have nothing to show for that. No ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù physique like people think. No weight loss. No better mindset. Just more self hatred, scars, and the loss of normal bodily functions. But I have to tell myself that thinness does not determine my disorder. I‚Äôm not less sick because I‚Äôm fat. I can‚Äôt keep brushing off my habits and saying that I don‚Äôt have a problem. I do. I need to get that into my head to be able to change my feelings.

For everyone out there who is feeling alone, or unworthy, or struggling with the same thing I am. You are worth it. Your disease does not define you. And your weight does not determine how serious your disorder is. You can‚Äôt just put something on the back burner because you feel like it‚Äôs not important. It is, and you are important too.

Beauty comes from within, maybe I should learn to love myself and not be so harsh. These girls look great, so can I, so why am I obsessing over the calories in an apple?

Scenario 2 is where I do go easier on myself. It may not be a binge or cheat day, but it's a day where I don't count any calories and just assume a 'how bad can it be' mentality. And this is when every woman I see is beautifully and effortlessly thin. This is where girls in skin tight gym gear jog pass me. This is where there are girls in crop tops and skinny jeans sit near me at the caf√©. The type of girls skinny enough to not even need to wear a bra. When I can hear Karen and Susan behind me talking about their latest WeightWatchers meeting. 

I choose a day where I can just forget about not having jutting hip bones or a flat stomach and I can order spaghetti and a milk shake and ice cream and just relax, and that's when the characters from CoCo decide to go to the same restaurant as me. I see them with their black coffee and salads and I look down at my huge plate of spaghetti and meatballs with a cookie milkshake and think, I should've ordered what they did.

I do really well and restrict and I'm not bloated and feeling good, and that's when all these gorgeous and glowing plus size girls are wandering around, so beautiful and carefree and I just. Can't. Win. I see their normal food ordered, sandwiches or pasta and cakes and treats, and I look at their food with jealousy as I nurse my black coffee and water and Coke zero. 

I just can't win.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cjer3d/when_i_restrict_i_see_curvey_or_overweight_people/

05-22-2019 03:01:25,brhsy8,26,Part III of the mini-mart boy chronicles aka: The First Date,False,False,False,290,False,0.95,False,"  So we texted back and forth and, both being fairly poor twenty-something‚Äôs, weren‚Äôt sure what to do with ourselves for our little excursion. A movie or lunch? Too pricey. The park? Too hot out. 

Then he suggested meeting up at our local library. It‚Äôs free and air-conditioned and we can talk - albeit quietly ‚Äì about our mutual love of books.

It was the perfect place to meet.

I deliberately arrived early because I needed time to calm my nerves. I sat near the door in an armchair so I could keep an eye out for him. I was a shaky, clammy, anxious mess. What the hell could someone like him possibly see in someone like me? He wasn‚Äôt gonna show up, I was certain. 

But then, as if on cue, he waltzed through the automatic doors and his smile ‚Äì OH MY GOD, you guys ‚Äì was absolutely radiant. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd really show,‚Äù was the first thing he‚Äôd said to me. ‚ÄúI was so surprised you even gave me your number. I figured you were already taken.‚Äù

My heart swelled.

We went to the back and he asked if we could have one of the private meeting rooms for an hour or so.

‚ÄúThis way we can talk and not disturb anyone who‚Äôs trying to read or get work done.‚Äù

Luckily nobody had needed to use that room because we sat there and talked for two-and-a-half hours.

Everything from our hobbies to our hopes and dreams, childhoods, and spiritual beliefs. Eventually even some of our emotional baggage was shared and why we didn‚Äôt think we were good enough for the other. 

We talked and more than a few times he‚Äôd begin his sentences with, ‚ÄúI usually don‚Äôt tell people this on the first date, but‚Ä¶‚Äù and then he‚Äôd share something personal.

He said it was because he just felt really comfortable for some reason.

We talked about our depression and how we both like to say or do random kind things for people because you never know what impact it might have on that person. The Ripple Effect.

‚ÄúThat first day in the mini-mart,‚Äù he‚Äôd explained, ‚ÄúI saw how down you looked. I figured you could use a compliment.‚Äù

And it was true. The very first day I met him I shamefully approached the counter with an armful of junk food I‚Äôd later binge and purge. 

I‚Äôd been out of a very unhealthy relationship for awhile and was feeling down. Eventually though, enough was enough; I had my own problems and some people you just can‚Äôt fix. So I let them go. But in the wake of it, I felt empty and alone; I thought I‚Äôd never find someone better who would see my many flaws and still want me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fat and I have psychosis,‚Äù I‚Äôd stated bluntly because at this point this was all too good to be true.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my issues too,‚Äù he‚Äôd assured, seemingly not even fazed. In fact, he found the fact that I occasional ‚Äúsee‚Äù beings from other dimensions to be really interesting. He was actually intrigued. 

He said he was hungry and asked if I‚Äôd like to come back to his house so he could cook us up something.

I hesitantly accepted the invitation. My three-day fast would be ruined, but it actually wasn‚Äôt totally devastating for me.

He made us pasta. I had a very small helping.

‚ÄúHave more,‚Äù he invited. ‚ÄúI made plenty.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been fasting and if I eat too much, I‚Äôll just throw it up,‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be wasteful or disrespectful.‚Äù

And then, that goddamn disarming smile of his.

‚ÄúEven if you throw up on purpose I won‚Äôt be upset. I‚Äôll know you tried.‚Äù

He walked me home a little later and at my building entrance, I thanked him we hugged and he gave me a quick little kiss on the lips.

‚ÄúText me so I know you got home safe,‚Äù I called out to him as I ascended the stairs to my floor.

‚ÄúI was planning on texting you anyway,‚Äù he responded with a chuckle. ‚ÄúGoodnight, beautiful. See you soon!‚Äù

And as I closed my front door behind me, I broke down in tears. 

But for the first time in a very long time these were tears of joy.

So here I am, eyeliner smudged, hands trembling as I type this, a huge fucking grin on my face. Your comments have been so heartwarming on my last couple of posts I just had to share. I don‚Äôt have many friends and it‚Äôs so refreshing when I see victories ‚Äì even seemingly small ones ‚Äì shared by others on here.

I don‚Äôt know where things are gonna go with this boy. Hell, he could say he never wants to see me again. He could be a guy that just wants to get me into bed. We might be friends or friends with benefits or something more. I‚Äôm just happy I let a positive person into my life that I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise.

Don‚Äôt limit yourself to your own viewpoint. For most of us on here our perception of ourselves is skewed. We see fat, ugly, unlovable, undesirable etc‚Ä¶ where others see smart, cute, funny, caring, kind.

Even if you don‚Äôt always hear it or feel it for yourself.

If anyone hasn‚Äôt heard the words ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù today, I love you. 

And keep fighting.

Keep fighting because you never know when or in what form your own version of my mini-mart boy may materialize. But this world is so vast, it‚Äôs out there, I‚Äôm sure of it.

Goodnight, beautiful.",Victories,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/brhsy8/part_iii_of_the_minimart_boy_chronicles_aka_the/

I had the strongest urges yesterday- i had binged 2400kcals just on peaches, nectarines, ground lean beef, sashimi, and corn (orthorexic binge lmfaoo). I was going to purge, but i didn't. however, i was planning a complete bp for tomorrow. Whenever I binge on \~healthy stuff!\~, I have the fucked up ED logic of b/ping the next day bc I shouldn't keep anything down. 

However, I persuaded myself that it wasn't worth it.  I've been fighting this for so long and I just. hate, hate purging. I never want to go back to purging. Every time I tried to convince myself I failed and always fell back to the cycle. However this time, I made it through. Even if I planned all the foods, the money, the time to bp- I didn't do it. 

This is a fucking tear-jerking victory for me, and I feel like sobbing of happiness. This has never happened before and I'm SO SO happy that I'm able to overcome my urges. (even though I fasted the next day.. anything is better than purging.)

 small steps, i guess. :)

 a tip: how i convinced myself was bc i convinced myself out of the mindset of 'this one purge wont hurt.' it is, and everytime you purge you just set yourself back.

Wake up groggy, laze about in bed without really knowing why until you realize it's because you're just killing time before you have to get up and inevitably eat. Strip naked even though you're freezing, weigh yourself, update four different apps. 

Drink some black coffee, hope the coffee makes you shit, and then maybe weigh yourself again just for fun. Make your standard breakfast omelet (241 kcal), weigh and measure all your ingredients, log it. Decide to eat some beans (110 kcal) right before you leave the house, at noon, because you have been super low-carb for a few days.

Do a bunch of normal stuff downtown and feel ridiculously proud of yourself for managing it. Get really hungry, go to Whole Foods, and eat a pouch of wild salmon (90 kcal) in your car like a complete freak. Text someone about meeting up up later and agree to a quiet evening of tea and conversation. Feel like a successful, balanced human being proving that you are capable of being in public and having a social life.

Get another text a few hours later saying they're inviting someone else to join, and they've booked a restaurant ‚Äî¬†a place you immediately know you can't eat at or even sit inside. Be totally rigid and inflexible and unable to cope. Try texting with an excuse, suggestion to meet afterwards, etc., but in the end just turn off your phone and flee the city. Consider taking yourself for a drink as a self-care type of treat, actually, but decide you can't justify 120 calories of a pro-inflammatory neurotoxin that will probably ruin your healthy streak.

Get back to your little suburban neighborhood and sit in the parking lot of an organic grocery store wondering what the fuck is wrong with you. Buy some vegetables and sparkling water. Wash and chop your vegetables and weigh them, toss them in a pot to steam. Salt liberally.

Put on a giant hoodie and sit in bed at 9:30 on a Saturday night eating a bowl of steamed vegetables (162 kcal), which has been your dinner for the past week and is the best part of your day. Post about it on Reddit because you are lonely and can't have real-world relationships and wow, you really didn't think this would be your life at thirty years old.

Somehow, I couldn't see this in my bathroom mirror at home. I thought I looked slim, yes- but not scary skinny. I managed to get my BMI up to 17.7 in the last month, and I felt that I already looked healthy enough. But I guess that seeing my body from a different perspective made me realize that I'm not healthy at all, yet.

I now understand why both my boyfriend and my FWB (I'm in an open relationship) are so worried about me. I understand why they are constantly asking if I've eaten, if I'm hungry. I understand why they tell me that they are afraid of hurting me physically during sex.

It's pretty clear how different the food culture there is from here and I've been thinking: It's already hard for us brazilians to deal with body image, but not as hard as it is for North Americans. Our perception of a good looking body is much more related to being a THIIIIC girl than a thin girl (my AN is actually not derived from wanting to be thin, but from control), and our food is much less addictive. 

""What do you mean addictive food?"". 

You have no fucking idea how much you are being poisoned... Here we have industrialized crap food as well, but I ate there the same food I eat here (same brands actually) and omfg, THE AMOUNT OF SALT AND SUGAR IS INSANE! They are completely twisting off your taste buds and creating addictive shit, and all the time I was there I was thinking it must be so hard to eat healthy because the junk food is actually cheaper than healthy food. This combined to a thin oriented culture and I'm so sorry. 

Sometimes reading this sub I get the impression it is kind of harder for you guys in many ways. Here if you are too thin, people's reaction rarely is about admiration, but concern, guys usually are put out by it. That and how much it seems competition is part of the American culture: Winning.

And I eat them and they're *amazing.* So I take a couple bits with me and get what I came to the store for. And then.

And then I go and eat more cookie pieces, that I am allergic to, off the goddamn floor of a supermarket, which has to be one of the dirtiest places ever. In the end I ate most of the packet.

ive been to the dietitian with my dad a couple times bc i'm now underweight & people are beginning to say stuff to him about it. yeah nosy church people are the best

she basically just gave me a ton of in depth information about different foods & what they do, & i've kinda picked and chosen stuff and i ended up losing 5 pounds in about a month.

so apparently chia seeds are magical?? 2 tablespoons of chia seeds is 130 calories which is a lot. HOWEVER. in that 2 tablespoon dosage each seed increases by 20% by absorbing water in your stomach. so you feel *full*. for a *long* time. it takes a while to digest them as well, & there's 10 grams of fiber too. literally i just swallow 2 tablespoons in the morning and i have no desire to eat until 6 or 7 pm. 

also! fish. meat used to be a biggg fear food for me. all tbe added oil, butter, blah blah blah. but 3 oz of mahi mahi (think of 4 king sized Hershey's bars stacked on top of each other, it's a lot) is NINETY CALORIES.

AND 20 GRAMS OF PROTEIN?? do you know how FILLING that is??? and it's so easy to cook in a nonstick pan with no seasoning. and my dad thinks i'm eating normally because its a lot of fish. it's great.


also something she said was i should eat more meals during the day if i'm going to eat so little. and i'm doing that now, but not really meals. and it's helping me so much with binges, i literally have not binged once this month. 

i'm eating a piece of small fruit every other hour (when i'm not at work) and then like a sweet potato or fish filet for lunch, and my total intake is coming to 300-400. and i don't feel the need to binge, because i'm already eating. 

also, on days i work i make sure to eat a lot of protein, and some extra chia seeds. i work in a kitchen where i could easily sneak a few bites in at a time of cookies/chicken nuggets that'd easily total up to 2x what i want to eat that day. but now if i go anywhere i know i'll be tempted, i make *sure* to get full before i leave so i know i won't overdo it.

01-30-2020 04:30:39,evy4lx,40,I noticed a lot of us have been binging (maybe more than usual) lately and I just want to say something:,False,False,False,261,False,1.0,False,"1) Binging sucks, but any physical changes it causes are hardly noticeable to anyone around you. So please **don't feel the need to go ""hard"" to compensate** or get back to your previous weight the next day. 

2) **Drink lots of water.** Most of what you ""gain"" from a binge is water weight, and (ironically) drinking water gets rid of this. Evidence? I lost 6lbs overnight between a day I binged and the next day after drinking more water than usual. 

3) If you're in a binge cycle and need to break it, a great way to do that is to **find a high-volume food you enjoy and ""binge"" that**. Sometimes your body just gets super used to being uncomfortably full and the sensation of being stuffed can accomplish the same thing a binge does. I love cauliflower rice (check the frozen section for some really nice mixed bags you can microwave), grapes, chopped apples with cinnamon microwaved or baked (tastes like apple pie), and steamed carrots. Bonus, you can dip vegetables in ketchup and it sometimes tastes like french fries--cauliflower and ketchup tastes weirdly good to me haha. 

4) Stretchy yoga pants and fuzzy socks with a baggy sweatshirt is my go-to outfit when I binge. Also **if you have a heating pad use that on your tummy.** It helps you feel a lot better. 

5) **Lay on your left side when you go to sleep.** If you just binged, laying on your left side helps your stomach digest. If you lay on your right side it can cause heartburn because the food doesn't go down into your intestines as well.

6) **Lay off the intense exercise.** You can get just as good a workout by going on a long walk. If you've been doing high-intensity workouts or lots of strength exercise or even running, it can trigger an inflammation response in your body that requires tons of energy for your body to repair. This can spike appetite and might get you in a vicious cycle of trying to burn off what you ate, thus triggering your appetite even worse the next time. 

These are ""tips"" that I hope help you feel a bit more comfortable if you've been binging. Remember you're not alone, I've been in this cycle for 5 years. Sometimes you can't stop it but you can make yourself feel tons better by doing these little things in acts of self-care. Just because you binge doesn't make you gross or bad, you just having an eating disorder that is beyond your control at times.

My joy was muted by the irritable defeat of a binge-purge episode. 

But as I was eating this single bowl of soup, I realized something I hadn't thought about in a long while. 

People eat. People *have* to eat. It's not a choice. 

Furthermore I realized that people eat much, much more than I would consider ""normal.""

For me a ""meal"" usually means a granola bar, or a glass of juice, or a few shots of whiskey, or, if I'm particularly ravenous, a couple servings of peanut butter. 

The idea of eating a hearty bowl of soup, though such a normal winter activity, felt entire foreign and downright illegal. 

But I did it. 

I did it and then I lied down with my laptop and my headphones and lost myself in a scene I was writing, full stomach and full head forgotten.

So I‚Äôm in the process of creating a survey for the PAST (smh) members of r/proED. 

I personally believe that it was ignorance that got the sub removed. People associate ‚Äúpro eating disorder‚Äù with supporting each other starving ourselves. But that‚Äôs totally the opposite of what it was. 

So i decided to make a surgery that asks about certain aspects of the sub, like ‚Äúhas it made your ed worse.‚Äù, ‚Äúhow have you felt that the sub has positively/negatively impacted you.‚Äù 

I believe that this sub should be allowed just like any other mental health or addiction subreddit. Eating disorders are LONELY AS FUCK. And I‚Äôm not gonna let other people incorrectly judge us. I‚Äôm gonna show that the majority of people were benefited by the sub and felt less alone/messed up because of it, and hopefully get it back. Or at least allow us to speak our minds. 

Gonna be posting the link in a bit, gotta put some finishing touches on it. 

Also, do y‚Äôall think a petition would also be beneficial?

I'm not Asian, but my family have been here for generations.

Most women I know have ED without even knowing it. The mental health help over there is horrible. I was fat shamed and shamed in general with how I look like. It doesn't matter if you're smart, talented, kind or whatever because it's all about how YOU look like.

Got tan skin? Shamed and treated like shit. Don't be surprised if random people fat shame you or call you ugly because that bloody happens.

My sister and I live in Australia now (THANK GOD!!!) and the most shocking thing for me is how 'body positive' Aussies are. It doesn't matter if you're an S, M, L or XL here and women openly talk about it. 

In Asia, if you're not skinny, a size S or XS or XXS, you're shamed. If you're not below a certain weight, you're shamed again. Got too tan, shamed once again. I was very shy and ashamed to say that I was a certain size or weight. It's the same shame someone gets when they admit they're a sex offender (no joke). 

Anyway, my sister's back in Asia visiting my mum. They went to a nail salon and that b*tch said ""why aren't you as beautiful as your mother?"" To my sister.

What the fuckkk??? Who the bloody hell does that? I'm so mad when she told me about it. Why even ask that question? What do they even expect her to answer? ""I don't know, bish. Ask God""???

I have had something similar happen to me as well. I've gained weight and people, saying ""Wow, *insert name*, you got fat!"" As if I don't know it and they say it in front of other people as well as if it's news to me. They do it with the sole purpose to shame you.

I'm glad that I have mostly recovered from an eating disorder thanks to the Australian mental health system. It may not be great, but it definitely is 1000x better than what they had back in Asia.

ProEd got shut down and it won't be long until this sub gets shut down if we are not all collectively careful. 

I feel like we are having a wave of new users, which means people are obviously finding this sub. If the first thing they see is 'what is the best way to lose x in x days', 'how do I hide purging from my boyfriend' or 'how do I  convince my family I'm eating' or whatever it is, non ED people will freak out and report us. 

We are all disordered here but we can't be seen to be promoting EDs and encouraging dangerous destructive behavior.

i had 800 calories at school. that was supposed to be it.

my mom messaged me and said that she'd buy burger king, asking if i wanted anything. literally ten minutes before that, i was thinking about recovery, and how i wanted to eat so that i can read and write more, and probably better too. so i texted her back what i wanted. it's \~850 calories (probably even more but i'm going to pretend that's it lol)

when i came home, twenty minutes ago, i randomly started eating candy. then i ate two ricecakes, and some bread. 310 calories of practically nothing. i didn't enjoy it.

but i haven't binged ""voluntarily"" for months now. for over two years, i struggled with lower restriction and huge binges, then a bit higher restriction and still huge binges (not huge huge, but more than a normal person would eat, especially in one sitting). but for a few months now, i've restricted to 800-1200 calories most days, going over once or twice a week (at the most thrice), always landing under 1600 except for three times, at social events. 

1960 calories is more than i would've needed if i ate like a normal person, but i don't. i don't restrict nearly as low as i used to and it bothers me, but it's still restriction, i know that. for the first time in almost a year, i'm losing weight. excruciatingly slow, but i am.

i have eaten 1110 calories so far. i still have the option to throw the burger king food away but i won't. i will try to enjoy it and not compensate by cutting even more later. i probably will try to compensate by eating less tomorrow, though, i will probably freak out even though i'm writing this essay about how it's okay. i'm not trying to recover. i need help but i can't get it until i'm not a minor anymore (only one and a half year to go, yay?)

hopefully, i'll get some energy from it, and lessen my constant headache enough to write something great tonight.",Rant / Rave,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ep3k2d/today_i_will_eat_too_much/
